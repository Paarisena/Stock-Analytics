MESSAGE FROM    THE CHAIRMAN Our objectives are aligned with India’s ambitions.  And   our strength comes from the belief that you –  our   shareholders – place in us. Dear Stakeholders, Let me begin with a salute and a bow of gratitude as a  fellow citizen who deeply acknowledges the courage of  our brothers and sisters that guard our peace. During Operation Sindoor, our brave men and women  in uniform stood tall, not for recognition, but for duty.  Times like these make us realise that peace cannot  be taken for granted. It is earned through decades of  silent sacrifice, unwavering resolve and strength built  far from the spotlight, in the deserts, on the borders  and deep at sea. Our achievements as a nation do not just lie in balance  sheets or boardrooms but also belong to the soldiers  who stand watch while we build, and to the uniform  that chooses service while we chase ambition. It is with this humbling sense of purpose that I write  to you today. In 2024-25, the Adani Group delivered  yet another year of significant growth. Growth built  on the bedrock of your unwavering trust, and a belief  in the long arc of transformation. And we have not  grown in calm seas. We have grown in the middle of  global turbulence. Over 60 nations have gone to the polls, redrawing  maps, rewriting alliances. Conflicts in the Middle  East have disrupted energy flows and logistics  corridors. Europe, once an economic stronghold, now  grapples with stagnation and a search for identity in a  fractured world. In the midst of all this, our country stood apart. While prudence elsewhere buckled under pressure,  India surged forward as a beacon of stability, of  growth amidst uncertainty and of confidence  amidst confusion. Yes, we have the wind at our back, a demographic  dividend, a booming digital economy and infrastructure  built at record pace. But make no mistake, this  momentum did not happen by chance. It is the result of vision. Of intent. Of policy with  purpose. I say this with full conviction that the Indian  Government, both at the Centre and across the states,  has laid down the foundation for a truly historic  transformation. A transformation not of a few, but for an  entire nation rising with ambition that declares - India’s  best chapters are just beginning. And together, we are  not just witnessing history. We are helping shape it. As a youngster, I saw my mother as my guiding star.  I recall her often saying: "ભાારતીીય સાામ્રાાજ્યોોનુંં� ભાાગ્ય  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં�  નું  હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ ક્યાા ર ેય  પ તીનું   પ ામ્ ય ા  નુંહી � , પણ  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં� હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ દ ર ેક પ તીનું  પછીી વધુ ં   શક્તિ� શ ાળીી અ નું ે અખં � ડ  સા� કલ્પ સાાથેે ફ ર ી ઊભાા રહ્યાં ા �."  Translated, it meant, "The future of India's empires was  not written by those who never accepted defeat, but by  those brave hearts who turned every fall into a stepping  stone - and each time rose again with stronger resolve  to change history." She would often tell me: “Gautam, history does not remember sailors who sailed  in calm waters; it remembers those who braved the  wildest storms and still returned home." And my dear shareholders, that is exactly what we  have done. Even in the face of fierce headwinds and relentless  scrutiny – we have never retreated. Instead – we have  recalibrated. We have reimagined. And we have become  – more formidable, more unbreakable, more stronger  and more resilient! People often ask me: “How does the Adani Group keep  doing it? How do we rise, time and again?” My answer remains the same: Our conviction is  anchored in clarity. Our objectives are aligned with  India’s ambitions. And our strength comes from the  belief that you – our shareholders – place in us. And all of this was tested last year, when we faced  allegations from the US Department of Justice and the  SEC relating to Adani Green Energy. Let me be clear: this was not the first time we have been  tested. Nor will it be the last. Every challenge sharpens  our resolve. Every setback becomes a stepping stone. Despite all the noise, the facts are that – no one from  the Adani Group has been charged with violating the  FCPA or conspiring to obstruct justice. We live in a  We have become –    more formidable,  more unbreakable,  more stronger and  more resilient! - GAUTAM ADANI Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 22 23 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

world where negativity often echoes louder than truth.  But as we cooperate with legal processes, let me also  restate - emphatically - our governance is of global  standards, and our compliance frameworks are robust  and non-negotiable. And while the numbers tell their own compelling story  – in a year of record-breaking revenue, unprecedented  growth and historic profitability – the deeper truth is  that these milestones are reflections of our relentless  strength and tenacity. They are proof of a Group that  dares to dream beyond constraints, powered by a nation  that breathes possibility into every tomorrow ahead  of us. Let me now talk about a few of the highlights of  FY   2024-25. Across all our sectors, we did more than  just scale – we created impact, inspired change, and  most importantly, deepened our national commitment. Adani Power crossed 100 billion units of power  generation, added 2.3 GW of conventional capacity,  funded  `   12,000+ crore in capex mainly through internal  accruals, and secured a 1,500 MW PPA in Maharashtra.  It is now well on track to reach 31 GW capacity by 2030. Adani Green reached an operational renewable energy  capacity of over 14 GW and is on target to build the  world’s largest renewable energy plant of 30 GW at  Khavda and a total of 50 GW of renewables capacity  by 2030. Also, with over 5,000 MW of pumped  hydro storage targeted to be installed by 2030 and a  40-year 1,250 MW energy storage PPA with UPPCL,  we are setting global benchmarks in the space of  energy transition. Adani Energy Solutions had a huge year. It secured  `   43,990 crore in transmission orders and executed  `   13,600 crore worth of smart metering projects.  It retained its no. 1 DISCOM rank in India and became  the only private player with three national HVDC grid  links in its portfolio. Adani New Industries is aligned with the nation's  sustainability goals and has an order book for  construction of a 300 MW electrolyser plant. It also  launched an electrolyser testing lab at Mundra. It is  on track to expand its solar module manufacturing  lines and will have a 10 GW integrated solar  module manufacturing facility in place by the next  financial year. Adani Ports continued to strengthen its value  proposition as an Integrated Transport Utility with  unparalleled waterfront to customer gate capabilities.  Adani Ports handled an all-time high cargo volume of  450 MMT and achieved a 27% market share in India.  Atmanirbharta. This is the future we are grateful to have  an opportunity to help build. And the same applies to building Data Centers that  India needs to stay competitive in the technology  space. With the surge in AI, AdaniConneX is scaling fast.  We have projects exceeding 210 MW in various stages of  construction in partnership with the global hyperscalers  and have launched a giga-scale renewable-powered data  center campus in Navi Mumbai. Continuing the path of sustainability, Adani Total  Gas is playing a defining role in India’s clean energy  transition. As of this year, we serve close to 1 million PNG  customers and operate 647 CNG stations. Our roadmap  is to double both by 2030. Our e-mobility footprint  now spans 22 states and 4 union territories, with over  3,400 EV charging points installed, thereby positioning  us at the forefront of India’s evolving sustainable  energy ecosystem. But perhaps our most transformative project is unfolding  in Dharavi - Asia’s largest slum, now being reimagined  as India’s most ambitious urban rehabilitation project.  Over 1 million people will move from narrow lanes to  sunlit, modern homes. Inspired by Singapore’s housing  model and co-designed with global experts, the township  will feature spacious layouts, dual toilets, open spaces,  schools, hospitals, transit hubs and parks. Our Dharavi Social Mission is uplifting youth through  skilling, healthcare and employment programmes. A new  multi-modal mobility hub, amphitheatre, cloud kitchens  and riverfront are being planned to serve all of Mumbai. In terms of consolidated numbers, at the Group level,  revenues grew by 7%, EBITDA by 8.2%, and our Net  Debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained healthy at 2.6x. But, as I have stated in the past, our objective is  not to just build businesses - it is to create new  possibilities. Not just to serve markets - but to serve  our nation’s destiny. And in this context, our capital  investment across businesses is set to break all  records. We anticipate an annual CAPEX spend of  USD 15-20 billion for the next 5 years. These are  not just investments in our Group, but investments  in the possibilities for doing our part to build  India’s infrastructure. Before I start wrapping up, let me outline some of the  programmes that have me the most excited about. Exactly three years ago, on my 60 th  birthday, my  family pledged  `   60,000 crore to redefine healthcare,  education, and skill development in India. The Adani  Healthcare Temples are our first major step – world-class,  Adani Ports also continued to strengthen its logistics  network within the Indian hinterland across its diverse  range of assets including rakes, multi-modal logistics  parks, warehouses, agri silos and trucks, in addition  to starting freight forwarding services and a trucking  management platform. Adani Ports' marine division  also completed the successful acquisition of Astro  Offshore during the year and is set to deliver 3x growth  by FY   2026-27. Adani Natural Resources too had a very strong  year contributing to India's energy independence.  It produced a record 47 million tonnes of coal and  iron ore and is on track to achieve over 30% growth  by FY 2025-26. We also pioneered India’s first  hydrogen-powered mining truck as well as launched  an e-commerce platform that will soon enable  online trading of LPG, rock phosphate, copper and  precious metals. Also, in line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, Kutch  Copper has successfully produced its first copper anode  at Mundra thereby marking a strategic move in India’s  capability to meet the surging demand for energy  transition materials. Two and a half years ago, when we acquired  Holcim’s India cement business, we had made a bold  commitment: to double our capacity to 140 MTPA by  FY 2027-28. Today, I am proud to share that we have  already achieved 72% of that target and crossed the  100 MTPA milestone, becoming the ninth-largest  cement company globally. Adani Airports also had a record year of growth.  It launched Aviio – India’s first unified airport operations  app as well as reinforced its position as the country’s  fastest-growing airport operator. We handled a record  94 million passengers in FY 2024-25, registering a  7% growth. We also completed the first test flight at  the greenfield Navi Mumbai Airport, which will open  later this year with an initial passenger capacity of  20   million of what will eventually become a 90 million  passenger airport. When it comes to Adani Defence, we now stand at  the dawn of a new era. Our world-class ammunition  and missile capabilities in Kanpur is a vision to forge  one of South Asia's most formidable complexes.  When Operation Sindoor called, we delivered.  Our surveillance drones became the eyes in the skies,  our kamikaze drones became the swift swords of  attack, and our anti-drone systems became the shield  to help protect our forces and citizens. Every innovation  we make and every system we build is a salute to  the courage of our Armed Forces. This is the spirit of  affordable 1,000-bed campuses in Ahmedabad and  Mumbai with medical colleges, research centres and  wellness spaces all integrated together. Mayo Clinic  is our partner in guiding us to create a future-ready,  AI-powered, patient-first healthcare ecosystem. In parallel, we have committed  `  2,000 crore to build  a world-class skill university and finishing school in  Mundra, designed to empower youth from across India.  Through Schools of Excellence, global certifications  and partnerships with leaders like ITEES Singapore and  IGCC, we aim to create an industry-ready workforce.  This is more than philanthropy – it is our promise to  India because we believe that we are building not just  institutions, but legacies of transformation. And finally, let me end by talking about our participation  at the Maha Kumbh Mela. Over 650 million people  came together, not as strangers, but as one soul.  One purpose. One heartbeat. Along with ISKCON, the  Adani Group initiated the Mahaprasad Seva, offering  free meals to lakhs of devotees. More than 5,000 of our  employees volunteered wholeheartedly, reflecting the  values we cherish. With my family, I had the honour of performing the  sacred Ganga Aarti at the Triveni Sangam – and for  the Adani Group to be part of this was one of the  most moving days of my life. For me, the Maha Kumbh  is not just a festival. It is India’s soul on display – a  living testimony to our resilience, our unity and our  unwavering faith. And we were grateful to have had the  opportunity to perform seva at this year's Maha Kumbh. Let me conclude by saying that history should  remember us not for the size of our balance sheet,  but for the strength of our backbone. Not just for the  markets we entered, but for the storms we handled and  emerged stronger. For it is easy to lead in sunshine, but  true leadership is forged in the face of crisis. Strength is not just power – it is purpose, clarity and the  will to rise. And resilience is not endurance alone – it is  reinvention in the face of adversity. When combined, it  helps us do our part for building an India that refuses to  bend, refuses to break and never stops believing in its  own future. That is our truth. That is our legacy. That is our promise. The greatest chapters of our story are still ahead.  Thank you for being on this journey with us. Jai Hind.

Adani Enterprises  launched its  maiden public  issuance of  non-convertible  debentures  (NCDs) for  `  800  crore which is  first public issue  by any private  corporate in last  decade. - RAJESH S ADANI  Managing Director MESSAGE  FROM THE  MANAGING  DIRECTOR The record-high consolidated EBITDA of  `   16,722   crore posted during the year – with  60% contribution from incubating businesses – showcased the strength and consistency of our  incubation strategy. Dear Stakeholders, At the centre of an organisation’s sustained,  long-term growth lies a strong and resilient  core. At Adani Enterprises, we witnessed the  realisation of this belief during FY 2024-25,  as the company continued to demonstrate  long-term strength in performance despite  certain short-term challenges. Our execution  excellence – backed by best-in-class  management practices, state-of-the-art  technologies, innovation strength, high  credit ratings, fully funded growth strategies  and a strong sustainability focus – ensured  that the company remained aligned with its  strategic growth plans across all business  segments. The record-high consolidated EBITDA of  `  16,722 crore posted during the year –  with 60% contribution from incubating  businesses – showcased the strength and  consistency of our incubation strategy.  Driven by this strategy, which centres on  creating incremental value for stakeholders  and supporting India’s growth journey,  our consolidated income for the full year  increased by 2% to  `  1,00,365 crore. A key highlight was that AEL’s incubating  business EBITDA of  `  10,025 crore for  FY   2024-25 surpassed the Company’s total  consolidated EBITDA of  `  10,012 crore in  FY   2022-23. For the full fiscal year 2024-25,  while the EBITDA touched  `  16,722 crore,  consolidated profit before tax rose by 16%  to  `  6,533 crore. These figures stand as a  testimony to the success of our strategic  efforts in driving operational efficiency across  all business verticals, while expanding our  incubating asset base. I am pleased to share that Adani Enterprises  launched its maiden public issuance of  non-convertible debentures (NCDs) for  `  800   crore which is first public issue by any  private corporate in last decade. During the  year AEL & its subsidiaries raised  `  8,000+  crore (USD ~1 billion) from market with mix  of Equity and Debt instruments to support  incubation businesses which were well  received by diversified set of investors. The company reported solid growth in  emerging core infrastructure businesses,  particularly through Adani New Industries  Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 26 27 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

Ltd (ANIL) – the Green Hydrogen Ecosystem  – and Adani Airport Holdings Ltd (AAHL) –  highlighting the scale of opportunities in these  sectors. These developments also underscore  the strength of our core capabilities, nurtured  through strategic investments in high-potential  growth areas. EBITDA for ANIL surged by 108% to  `  4,776 crore, with EBITDA margins rising  due to improved realisations and operational  efficiencies from integrated cell and module  production. Our focus on executing greenfield  projects across three giga-scale integrated  manufacturing plants was a key driver of  this robust performance. The wind turbine  manufacturing business marked significant  milestones: the 3.3 MW Wind Turbine Generator  (WTG) model was listed in the Revised List of  Models & Manufacturers (RLMM), expanding  our offering to four listed models. During the  year the wind turbine business has expanded its  capacity to 2.25 GW from 1.5 GW. I am also happy to share that we received the  Letter of Award from SECI for an electrolyser  manufacturing facility of 101.5 MW per annum,  taking our cumulative awarded capacity to  300 MW per annum – a milestone that greatly  boosts our growth confidence. Our focus in this  segment will remain on investing in innovative  technologies to support its high-growth  trajectory. AAHL also demonstrated operational and  financial excellence, with EBITDA increasing  43% to  `  3,480 crore and passenger movement  rising by 7% to  `  94.4 million. The accelerated  development of greenfield Navi Mumbai  International Airport played a vital role, with  the airport successfully completing its first  commercial flight validation test – bringing it  closer to operational readiness. During the year, 40 new routes, 16 new airlines  and 43 new flights were added to the network.  The inauguration of Terminal 3 at Lucknow Airport  marked another milestone. Thiruvananthapuram  International Airport achieved Level 2  accreditation under Airports Council of India’s  Airport Customer Experience Programme.  Mumbai Airport became the first in India – and  third globally – to achieve Level 5 accreditation,  reaffirming its commitment towards customer  satisfaction. These developments reflect our commitment  to service excellence and stakeholder trust.  This trust was evident in AAHL’s successful  `  1,950 crore (USD ~230 million) NCD issuance,  subscribed by mutual funds and banks. In our Data Centre business, AdaniConneX  Pvt Ltd, we achieved significant milestones in  phased construction. Phase I of the Hyderabad  Data Centre (9.6 MW) and Noida Data Centre  (10   MW) are now fully operational. The Pune Data  Centre has crossed 75% completion for Phase I  and II. Construction is also underway at the Navi  Mumbai Data Centre (30 MW). Our Roads business, Adani Road Transport  Ltd (ARTL), saw record-breaking progress,  with the highest-ever 2,410.1 lane-km  constructed in a year. The Ganga Expressway  reached 75% completion and three out of ten  under-construction projects crossed the 90%  milestone. We also achieved provisional COD  for the Panagarh–Palsit BOT project in West  Bengal and the Kodad–Khammam HAM project  in Telangana. ARTL’s SPVs raised  `  1,124 crore  (USD ~130 million) through AAA rated NCDs with  maturities of up to 11 years. In the Natural Resources – MDO business, we  now have 13 mining service contracts, with six  operational. We produced 47 million tonnes of  coal and iron ore during the year, meeting all  customer schedules. A significant development  was the Letter of Award for an iron ore mine  (7   MTPA capacity) at Taldih, Odisha. We also  signed four new MDO agreements for coal blocks.  With these additions, AEL’s MDO portfolio now  comprises 11 coal blocks and 2 iron ore blocks,  affirming our ability to deliver value through  operational excellence. In our primary industry incubation portfolio  in metals, our Kutch Copper unit at Mundra,  with a capacity of 500 KTPA, has commenced  operations, with capacity ramping up in  phases. The pace of execution highlights our  ability to build and scale with a long-term  value creation focus. In the Integrated Resources Management  (IRM) business, we continued to nurture a  broad base of relationships across end-user  industries. We remain India’s no. 1 player  and are working to expand into new market  segments through initiatives such as the IRM  e-portal, which has enhanced ease of doing  business for retail customers and expanded  our market share with a balanced mix of retail  and public sector clients. Needless to say, our achievements are made  possible by the dedication and commitment  of our teams — our core engine of success.  We will continue to invest in their well-being  while exploring new opportunities for  sustained and sustainable growth. Sustainable growth remains central to  our future-focused business strategy.  AEL posted a sector-leading net score of  60 out of 100 in the S&P Global Corporate  Sustainability Assessment (CSA) for 2024 – up  from 49 in 2023 – placing us among the top five  ESG-performing companies globally out of 180  sector peers. Airports in Mumbai, Ahmedabad,  Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Jaipur won  several sustainability awards, further reinforcing  our ESG commitment. We also strengthened  our CSR initiatives, aligned with our ethos of  responsible growth. Operationally, we will continue leveraging our  core strengths to scale up incubation through  targeted investments and execution excellence.  With the continued support of our stakeholders  – employees, lenders, shareholders, governments  and communities – we remain committed to  partnering India in its journey to becoming a  global economic powerhouse. I look forward to  your continued trust and support in this shared  journey of value creation and inclusive growth.

Engaging in Meaningful Dialogues A continual engagement with stakeholders provides  us with the opportunity to assess our impacts. It also  empowers us to effectively comprehend their needs  and address them effectively. Our stakeholder involvement process is guided by  a company-level  stakeholder engagement policy ,  aligned to international and national best practices.  This policy serves as a guiding framework for our  engagement mechanism, enabling consistent and  efficient communication with internal and external  stakeholders across our businesses. We employ a systematic approach to stakeholder  engagement based on an inclusive closed-loop  methodology guided by international frameworks  such as the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement  Standard. This process involves identifying relevant  stakeholders who are variably or invariably affected  by our operations, or those that can influence it.  This approach allows us to tailor our engagement  plans and ensure that stakeholder concerns are  effectively integrated into our policies, operational  procedures and decision-making. Throughout the year, we continuously connect  with stakeholders through various channels,  gathering valuable insights that guide our strategy.  Our engagement strategy includes periodic impact  assessments, formal consultations as well as  mechanisms for frequent feedback and grievance  redressal. This ensures that stakeholder concerns are  adequately understood and appropriately addressed. The ability to understand  stakeholder expectations,  address their concerns,  and prioritise our key  focus areas is enabled  by effective stakeholder  engagement, which is  essential to achieving our  strategic objectives.  Pursuing a Clear Methodology We recognise the need of engaging with our  stakeholders in building strong relationships.  Our efforts are geared towards ensuring that their  concerns are effectively addressed. The stakeholder  engagement approach involves prioritising  communication with these groups and gathering  feedback to understand their expectations. We value  the inputs of our stakeholders, as their concerns,  expectations and ambitions shape our materiality  evaluation and guide the development of our  short-term and long-term corporate objectives. To ensure effective stakeholder engagement, we have  constituted:    A Board-level Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee  pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable  provisions of Companies Act 2013 and the Securities  and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and  Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015    A Board-level ESG Committee - Corporate  Responsibility Committee (CRC; comprising entirely  of Independent Directors) leads quarterly review  sessions and brings relevant stakeholder issues to the  attention of our Board of Directors during meetings We strive to identify the actual and perceived impacts  on each stakeholder group and tailor our engagement  plans accordingly. At the core of our commitment to building a  sustainable business is an approach to ensure  meaningful and active engagement with our  stakeholders. This collaboration transcends  mere dialogue, thriving on co-creating  solutions and forging partnerships that unlock  shared prosperity. By actively listening to and  understanding our stakeholders' needs, we  cultivate a robust ecosystem forged on trust,  transparency, and mutual benefit.

Our Approach to Materiality Our materiality approach evaluates both the  impact of our operations on the economy,  environment, and society, and the financial  implications of ESG issues on our business  performance. By integrating these perspectives,  we ensure that our strategies are robust  and aligned with long-term value creation.  This balanced approach allows us to navigate  the complexities of the modern business  environment while staying true to our  commitment to sustainability. Our double materiality assessment, aligned with  the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  (CSRD) guidelines, enables us to identify and  address both risks and opportunities effectively.  We also incorporate insights from the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability  Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the  Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework, ensuring  comprehensive coverage of both general and  sector-specific standards. Our Materiality Assessment follows the Principles  of Double Materiality, Comprising: Financial  Materiality The impact of the  external environment  on our ability to  generate value over  the short, medium, or  long term Impact  Materiality The impact of our  activities on people,  the environment  and the economy in  the short, medium,  or long term Materiality Assessment Process Impact Evaluation Our materiality assessment is aimed at  identifying the most critical ESG issues  that influence our business operations and  our capacity to generate long-term value.  Each material issue is intricately tied to  a business case, underscoring its direct  financial implications on our operational  costs and revenue streams. We have crafted  tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies  to effectively address these material issues  through targeted initiatives, products,  and services. By clearly articulating these  strategies, we ensure alignment with our  overarching goal of achieving sustainable  success. We place significant emphasis on  evaluating and quantifying the impact of  our operations on external stakeholders.  Utilising quantitative metrics linked to the  identified material issues, we determine the  environmental and social impacts of our  business activities in areas such as air and  water quality, community wellbeing, and local  economic development. These evaluations  guide our strategic decision-making by  enabling us to prioritise the most relevant  issues affecting our stakeholders. Finalisation of Material Topics After identification of the key issues, the  topics encompassing both financial and  impact materiality are finalised through a  structured consultation process involving  both internal and external stakeholders.  The resultant materiality matrix incorporates  both inside-out and outside-in impacts in  alignment with the principles of double  materiality. Regular Review We update our materiality assessment  once every two years and communicate  any significant changes in our business  nature or material topics to relevant external  stakeholders. Double materiality Strategic  prioritisation for  sustainable success At AEL, materiality assessment is more than just a strategic tool; it is a reflection of  our core values and a testament to our unwavering commitment to sustainable growth.  In our efforts to realise this commitment, we are continually striving to create a future  that is resilient, inclusive and prosperous for all. Our efforts are driven by continuous  engagement with our stakeholders, and a deep understanding of the issues that matter  the most.

This year, the materiality assessment  process also included three new businesses which have recently become operational – Wind  Turbine Manufacturing, Copper Smelting and Digital Labs. The outcomes of the double materiality  assessment are reviewed and approved by our Senior Management, and any identified risks and  opportunities are seamlessly integrated into our enterprise risk management framework. We began by mapping the value chain to gain a comprehensive understanding of the business models, products and  services, including the geographical scope and resource dependencies. This process was essential for identifying  key stakeholders, and developing an engagement plan to involve them in the assessment process. Establishing the Scope, and Relevant Stakeholders A comprehensive business and stakeholder analysis plan was developed by engaging relevant  stakeholders and identifying key impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs). The material topics and IROs were prioritised using established thresholds and developing a materiality  matrix. Stakeholders were engaged to validate and refine the material topics, leading to a double materiality  matrix that comprehensively addresses both financial and sustainability impacts. Identification and Understanding the Relevant  Impacts, Risks and Opportunities Prioritising and Establishing the Material Topics The materiality issues were evaluated by defining criteria and thresholds, evaluating IROs,  and engaging with stakeholders. The focus was on prioritising key impacts, risks and  opportunities to direct our strategic efforts towards the priority issues. Evaluation of Material Issues and Associated IROs The various material topics were identified based on sector-specific ESG disclosures and rating frameworks as well  as industry best practices. The topics were also benchmarked against those prioritised by leading national and  international peers, underscoring our role in leading India's sustainability efforts.

“The global PVC market is growing at  4%, while India’s domestic demand  exceeds 4 MMT per annum, with only 1.5  MMT of production capacity, creating  significant import substitution potential.  Currently, MPL is developing a 1 MMTPA  PVC plant. All long-lead items have been  ordered, and the project is progressing  as per schedule. MPL aims to explore  more such opportunities of developing  an integrated petrochemical cluster and  reduce India’s import dependency in line  with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat   campaign.” - MR JAYANT PARIMAL, CEO Segment Overview Introduction The Company is currently developing a Polyvinyl  Chloride (PVC) manufacturing plant with a capacity  of 1 MMT per annum, and plans to establish a  petrochemical cluster in Mundra, Gujarat. India's annual PVC demand stands at 4.5   MMT,  while domestic production capacity is only 1.5  MMT, resulting in a supply-demand gap of 3 MMT.  Key demand drivers include agriculture, construction,  and infrastructure sectors. The proposed PVC project  aims to address this supply gap, reduce import  dependency, and strengthen India’s petrochemical  self-sufficiency. Business Opportunities India is poised to become a global petrochemical  hub, driven by rising domestic investment, a push for  import reduction, and sustained consumption growth.  Currently valued at USD 220 billion, India ranks  sixth globally in chemical sales, with petrochemical  demand projected to grow at a CAGR of 8% over the  next 15 years. The country’s strong macroeconomic  fundamentals, growing population, and industrial  expansion are key factors fuelling this growth. Despite low per capita consumption compared to  developed nations, India has significant demand  expansion potential, making it a focal point for  investment in petrochemical manufacturing. India is  expected to contribute 10% of incremental global  petrochemical demand growth and expand its  share beyond the current 4% of global capacity.  According to the International Energy Agency (IEA),  India will drive over a third of global oil demand  growth by 2030 and nearly half by 2050, led by  economic expansion, urbanisation, and industrial  development.

Risk Risk  Category Capitals  Impacted Impact Adaptation / Mitigation Strategy Heat Stress  & Heat  Waves Chronic  (Heat  stress)  & Acute  (Heat  wave) Under moderate climate scenarios  (SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 2-4.5), rising  temperatures will increase cooling  demands, leading to higher  operational costs, particularly in solar  manufacturing and data centers. The  businesses may face productivity  losses, health risks, and increased  absenteeism. In the worst-case  scenario (SSP5-8.5), extreme heat  events will become more frequent,  causing widespread power outages,  additional strain on grid electricity,  and potential fire hazards in  industrial operations. Since heat stress and heat waves can  increase cooling demands and energy  consumption, energy-efficient cooling  systems and smart thermostats are  deployed to ensure energy savings.  We use reflective materials, cool  pavements, and green infrastructure  (e.g., green walls) to reduce the  indoor temperatures. Moreover, we  implement rotational work shifts to  limit heat exposure during heat waves. Flood Acute In scenarios with moderate warming  (SSP2-4.5), heavy rainfall events will  increase the likelihood of flash floods,  disrupting airport operations, mining  activities, and our solar manufacturing  site. Flooding can cause blackouts,  infrastructure damage, and  transportation delays. Under the  extreme scenario (SSP5-8.5), more  frequent and intense downpours  could overwhelm stormwater drainage  systems, leading to extended power  outages and machinery failures in  critical facilities. We have installed efficient drainage  systems, sump pumps, and backflow  preventers and ensure adequate  elevation for critical infrastructure.  We also conduct periodic internal  assessments to strengthen emergency  response and disaster recovery plans. Cyclones Acute With global warming in the SSP2-4.5  scenario, the frequency and intensity  of cyclones will increase, particularly  affecting coastal facilities, leading to  property damage, flight cancellations,  and supply chain disruptions. In the  extreme SSP5-8.5 scenario, cyclones  will bring severe storm surges, further  exacerbating flood risks. We have undertaken significant  efforts to strengthen cyclone-resilient  infrastructure and reinforce buildings.  We have also secured insurance  coverage for disaster-related damage  to our risk-prone assets.

In the SSP2- 4.5 scenario, prolonged droughts  could reduce groundwater levels,  impacting industrial processes and  increasing reliance on costly water  transportation. Under SSP5-8.5,  severe drought conditions will result in  long-term water shortages, affecting  not only business operations but  also local communities, leading to  reputational risks. We use real-time monitoring systems  to optimise water use and have  developed detailed contingency  plans to conserve water including the  implementation of water recycling  technologies and development of  seawater treatment plants to procure  water from non-competitive sources. Sea Level  Rise Chronic In the SSP2-4.5 scenario, gradual sea- level rise will increase flood risks in low- lying facilities, leading to infrastructure  damage and potential operational  downtime. By SSP5-8.5, coastal areas  will face significant land erosion  and frequent inundation, severely  impacting industrial sites located  near shorelines. Rising sea levels  will also heighten storm surge risks,  compounding the effects of cyclones. We have integrated adaptation  plans against sea level rise into our  long-term asset development plans  and undertake efforts to ensure  critical infrastructure is elevated  and construct seawalls to safeguard  against sea-level rise. Risk Risk  Category Capitals  Impacted Impact Adaptation / Mitigation Strategy Carbon Pricing  & Emissions  Regulations Current and  Emerging  Regulatory  Risk Under Net Zero 2050 policies,  businesses will face increasing  carbon taxes and emission trading  costs. In a moderate transition  scenario, regulatory frameworks  will gradually tighten, requiring  significant investment in emission  reduction technologies. Under  an aggressive transition to Net  Zero, high carbon costs will  directly impact operational  margins, making fossil fuel-based  businesses less competitive. We have undertaken a target to  reduce our GHG emission intensity  by 45% till 2030, in alignment with  India’s goals and are working on  integrating internal carbon pricing  into our business decisions. We  are also investing significantly  into innovative decarbonisation  solutions and exploring low- carbon technologies for large scale  adoption.

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 287 The global economy stood resilient in 2024 after a  prolonged period of unprecedented shocks. However, this  recovery faces renewed headwinds from rising trade  tensions, policy shifts, and heightened uncertainty.  As per the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  estimates, global GDP growth stood at 3.3% in 2024.  However, growth remained uneven across regions, with  advanced economies recording a modest 1.8% increase,  while emerging markets and developing economies  (EMDEs) grew at a stronger pace of 4.3%, underscoring  regional economic disparities. Inflationary pressures showed signs of easing, with  global headline inflation projected to decline to 4.3%  in 2025 and further to 3.6% in 2026. The monetary  tightening measures adopted by major central banks  have been instrumental in curbing inflation, although  sustained fiscal discipline remains essential for long-term  economic stability.  Advanced economies are expected to return to their  inflation targets more rapidly than emerging markets  and developing economies. Good prices have largely  stabilised; however, services price inflation remains  elevated in many regions. Heightened volatility in energy and commodity markets,  coupled with a prolonged high-interest rate environment,  has added to the economic headwinds. This scenario has  particularly affected developing nations dependent on  energy imports, while energy-exporting economies have  benefited from sustained demand and price adjustments. Oil prices grew modestly by 0.9% in 2024, averaging  around USD 81 per barrel, driven by production cuts from  the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  (OPEC), robust global oil demand growth, and ongoing  geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which counteract  strong supply growth from non-OPEC+ producers. Global trade saw a measured recovery in 2024, with  merchandise trade volumes expanding by 2.4%,  constrained by persistent geopolitical tensions and  rising protectionist policies. Export-driven economies,  particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, demonstrated  resilience, supported by strong demand for technology  and consumer goods. Yet, ongoing conflicts and  supply chain disruptions have dampened overall trade  momentum, posing challenges to sustained global  economic expansion. Region-wise growth (%) Region CY    2024 CY    2025 (P) CY    2026 (P) Global Economy 3.3 2.8 3.0 Advanced  Economies (AEs) 1.8 1.4 1.5 Emerging Markets  and Developing  Economies (EMDEs) 4.4 3.7 3.9 P: Projections (Source: IMF World Economic Outlook April 2025) Performance of major economies  United States In the United States, policy uncertainty, trade tensions,  and a softer demand outlook pose challenges. Tariffs are  expected to weigh on growth in 2025, which is projected  at 1.7%, down from 2.8% in 2024 amid moderate  private consumption. China China's GDP growth is expected to decline to 4% in 2025  from 5% in 2024 due to prolonged trade policy uncertainty  and impending tariffs which offsets the stronger carryover  from 2024 and fiscal expansion in the budget.  United Kingdom Growth in the United Kingdom is expected to remain  moderate at 1.1% in 2025. This reflects a smaller  carryover from 2024, the impact of recent tariff  announcements, an increase in gilt yields, and weaker  private consumption amid higher inflation as a result of  regulated prices and energy costs. Japan For Japan, the growth projection for 2025 is 0.6%,  marking an increase from 0.1% in 2025. Growth will  be supported by stronger private consumption with  above-inflation  wage  growth  boosting  household  disposable incomes.  Management Discussion & Analysis Global Economic Overview 

288 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Germany Persistent weakness in manufacturing continues to  weigh on the growth of Germany, with its economy  expected to contract by 0.2% in 2024. However, growth  is expected to improve in 2025 owing to stronger  consumption on the back of rising real wages and a  projected fiscal easing.   Outlook Global economic growth is expected to moderate from  3.3% in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025, before recovering to 3%  in 2026. The combined effects of new trade restrictions,  their spillover through global trade linkages, and rising  uncertainty may dampen business sentiment and pace of  economic recovery. Financial market volatility has raised  concerns about extreme vulnerabilities, particularly in  countries grappling with persistent inflation and signs of  economic slowdown.  Policymakers worldwide face the challenge of balancing  economic growth with financial stability. While advanced  economies navigate the lingering effects of elevated  inflation and restrictive monetary policies, emerging  markets stand to benefit from economic diversification  and demographic advantages. While there are emerging signs of stabilisation, the  global economy’s trajectory remains fragile, heavily  dependent on effective fiscal policies, geopolitical  de-escalation,  and  coordinated  efforts  to  mitigate  inflationary and trade-related pressures and ensure a  stable and sustainable economic trajectory. Indian Economic Overview India has emerged as a bright spot in a global  environment marked by economic challenges and  geopolitical uncertainties. The nation is on track  to  become  the  world’s  third-largest  economy,  with  a  projected  GDP  of  USD  5  trillion  by  FY  2027-28.  Robust infrastructure development, efforts to  accelerate manufacturing, favourable policy reforms,  and strong consumer and business sentiments, will be  the fundamental drivers of growth, positioning India as a  key player in the global economy.  Indian economic growth (%) FY 2022-23 7.0 FY 2023-24 8.2 FY 2024-25 (Estimates) 6.5 India  is  expected  to  grow  at  6.5%  in  FY  2024-25,  lower than 8.2% growth in FY 2023-24, as per IMF.  This moderation is attributed to subdued external  demand, manufacturing and services sector slowdowns,  and inflationary pressures. The manufacturing sector’s  growth is expected to decline to 5.3% from 9.9% in  the previous fiscal, primarily due to global supply  chain disruptions and rising input costs. The services  sector is anticipated to grow at 5.8%, down from  6.4% in FY 2023-24. On the contrary, the agriculture and allied sector  demonstrated significant resilience, with growth  estimated at 3.8% in FY 2024-25, an increase from  the previous year's 1.4%. The construction sector is  expected to grow at 8.6% in FY 2024-25, underscoring  the government’s focus on infrastructure development. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) at  constant prices is expected to witness a growth of 7.3%  compared to 4% growth in the previous financial year.  The Real GDP or GDP at Constant Prices is estimated  to reach  `   184.88 lakh crore in FY 2024-25, against  the Provisional Estimate of GDP of  `  173.82 lakh crore  for FY 2023-24. India’s retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price  Index (CPI), eased to 4.6% in FY 2024-25. In a further  positive development, retail nflation for March 2025  declined to 3.34%. The sustained moderation in inflation  reflects the effectiveness of policy measures in  containing price pressures. Infrastructure development remains a key focus area,  with government capital expenditure reaching a  record  `  11.1 lakh crore. Goods and Services Tax (GST)  collections hit record highs, consistently exceeding  `  1.5   lakh crore monthly, reflecting strong consumption  and improved tax compliance.  Outlook The Indian economy is projected to grow at 6.2% in  FY 2025-26 and 6.3% in FY 2026-27 amid escalating  trade tensions and global uncertainties, as per IMF  estimates. Sustained investments in green energy,  digital transformation, and infrastructure development  will be crucial in boosting the growth. The government’s  emphasis on self-reliance, through continued support  under the PLI scheme, is expected to boost domestic  production and export capabilities. Favourable monsoon  rains are likely to enhance summer-sowing areas for  all major crops, improving agricultural output and  rural consumption. Inflation is seen moderating, due to government  and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) interventions,  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 289 with core inflation reaching its lowest in a decade.  However, challenges persist with food inflation, driven  by supply chain disruptions and adverse weather  conditions affecting key items. India’s demographic advantage and continued  investments in economic expansion offer a strong  foundation for growth. Initiatives like the National  Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation  Pipeline (NMP), PM Gati Shakti, and Atmanirbhar Bharat,  among others, are set to transform India's infrastructure  landscape with a focus on railways, road transport,  ports, and digital connectivity. Railways have seen the  introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the expansion  of Dedicated Freight Corridors. Road transport has  benefited from the National Industrial Corridor  Development Programme and the Bharatmala  Pariyojana that incorporate sustainable construction  practices and advanced traffic management systems.  The UDAN scheme has improved regional connectivity  and airport infrastructure. These efforts solidify India’s  position in the global economic landscape, enabling  the country to navigate uncertainties and capitalise on  emerging opportunities.

Industry Overview Coal is the backbone of India’s energy production,  serving as the primary fossil fuel and meeting over 70%  of the country's electricity demand. Consumption of coal  has been rising steadily, driven by the growing energy  demands of industrialisation, urbanisation, and  infrastructure development. By FY   2026-27, domestic  coal consumption is projected to reach 1,350 MT.  While the power generation sector is anticipated  to drive this growth in the near term, consumption  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 297 growth is likely to moderate from FY 2025 to FY 2027  as the share of renewable energy in India's power mix  increases. Despite abundant reserves, domestic coal  production has faced challenges in the past, including  delays in environmental and forest approvals, land  acquisition hurdles, and infrastructure bottlenecks.  These issues have resulted in significant dependence on  coal imports to meet the increasing domestic demand.  The government has introduced several measures to  boost indigenous coal production and reduce imports,  as a result of which domestic coal production has  grown at a CAGR of 6.4% from FY 2019 to FY 2024.  However, rising demand from the power and industrial  sectors continues to outpace domestic supply, leading  to an increase in imports of both coking and non-coking  coal. In FY 2024-25, non-coking coal import was at  167.10 MT while coking coal import stood at 54.08 MT.  India is the fourth-largest iron ore producer globally.  In FY 2024-25, iron ore production reached a record  289 million metric tonnes (MMT), reflecting a 4.3%  growth from 277 MMT in FY 2023-24. Growth in iron ore  production reflects strong demand from key end-user  industries such as steel and cement. The major iron ore  mines in India are concentrated in Odisha, Chhattisgarh,  Karnataka, and Jharkhand.

No. Material issue  identified Indicate  whether risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to adapt or  mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) 1 Business  Ethics and  Integrity Risk Business ethics and  integrity are foundational  to maintaining regulatory  compliance and stakeholder  trust. Non-adherence  can lead to severe legal  penalties,  financial  losses,  and damage to brand  reputation, which can affect  business opportunities and  valuation. In an increasingly  transparent world, ethical  lapses can quickly become  public, leading to long-term  reputational harm and loss  of customer and investor  confidence.  AEL enforces a comprehensive  Code of Business Conduct and  Ethics, ensuring adherence to  high standards through regular  training, audits, and a zero- tolerance policy for ethical  transgressions. The Company  also promotes a culture of  integrity and transparency,  encouraging employees to report  unethical behavior through  established whistleblower  mechanisms. Negative 2 Regulatory  Compliance Risk Compliance with regulations  is essential to avoid  legal  penalties,  financial  forfeiture, and operational  disruptions. Non-compliance  can also damage stakeholder  trust and brand reputation,  leading to loss of business  opportunities. As regulations  evolve, staying compliant  requires continuous  monitoring and adaptation  to new legal requirements. AEL employs robust compliance  frameworks, regularly updates  policies to align with changing  regulations, and conducts  compliance audits to ensure  adherence. The Company also  invests in training programs  to keep employees informed  about regulatory changes and  their implications for business  operations Negative

No. Material issue  identified Indicate  whether risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to adapt or  mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) 3 Climate  Change  Adaptation  and  Mitigation Risk Climate change poses  significant risks to business  operations, including  regulatory, physical, and  reputational challenges. As  global and local regulations  become more stringent,  companies must adapt to  new standards to avoid  penalties and maintain their  social license to operate.  Additionally, the physical  impacts of climate change,  such as extreme weather  events, can disrupt supply  chains and operations, while  failing to address climate- related issues can harm  a company's reputation  among stakeholders  increasingly concerned with  sustainability.  AEL addresses these risks by  investing in clean technologies  and renewable energy sources,  aiming to reduce its carbon  footprint and enhance energy  efficiency.    AEL  also  engages  with subject matter experts to  identify and manage exposure  to climate-related risks, ensuring  compliance with regulations  and minimizing environmental  impacts. By integrating climate  risk management into its  business strategy, AEL not only  mitigates potential risks but  also leverages opportunities for  growth and innovation in the  evolving energy landscape. Negative 4 Energy and  Emissions  Management Risk The   operations of AEL  demand a strategic  approach to managing  energy consumption and  emissions to align with  environmental regulations.  As India progresses towards  its ambitious goal of  achieving net-zero emissions  by 2070, it is anticipated  that more stringent energy  and emission-related laws  will be introduced. Failure  to proactively adapt to  these evolving regulations  could  lead  to  significant  financial burdens, including  unexpected compliance  costs, regulatory penalties,  and potential damage to  the company's reputation.  Therefore, it is imperative  for AEL to anticipate and  prepare for these changes  to mitigate risks and ensure  sustainable operations. AEL integrates renewable energy  sources and follows an Energy  Management Policy to optimize  energy use and minimize  emissions. The Company  also invests in energy-saving  technologies and practices, such  as  energy-efficient  equipment  and processes, to reduce its  carbon footprint and enhance  operational efficiency.

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 371   The establishment and operation of seven Safety Taskforces, addressing Standards & Procedures, Contractor  Safety Management, Training & Capability, Logistics Safety, Safety Interaction, Incident Investigation  & Audits, and Technological Intervention, are robust and adhere to the outlined charter and a three-tier  governance structure.   Most of AEL's business sites have achieved certification under ISO 45001:2018 (OHSMS), demonstrating  their commitment to occupational health and safety management standards.   Furthermore, the operational businesses have integrated the Group Safety Management System with  their existing Integrated Management Systems (IMS), such as ISO 14001 (EMS) and ISO 45001 (OHSMS),  enhancing the overall safety framework. All our sites are assessed on Health & Safety practices.   b.     What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine  basis by the entity?     The Adani Group has implemented a comprehensive array of globally recognized Safety Intervention and  Risk Assessment initiatives. These include Safety Interaction (SI), Vulnerability Safety Risks (VSR), Site Risk  Field Audits (SRFA), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). These initiatives  are integrated into the Business-specific Integrated Management System, which is based on the Hazard  Identification and Risk Assessment Process, such as HIRA and JSA. This structure has been adopted by the  company, and its reporting entities have developed a participative and consultative approach to engage all  relevant stakeholders, including employees, associates, and contract workers.   The Safety Assurance & Due Diligence program for internal Group Safety procedures is systematically  carried out by the Group Safety Team at Adani locations, based on project criticality and risk levels.   Furthermore, the Group Technological Intervention Taskforce has been pivotal in initiating and implementing  technology-driven solutions to reduce operational risks and enhance efficiency.   The Company acknowledges the necessity of managing and mitigating dynamic risks according to the  Hierarchy of Control to protect stakeholders and achieve the goal of Zero Harm, while also promoting  sustainable development.   These measures encompass a thorough understanding of the potential positive and negative impacts of  various occupational and personal factors on the organization. The primary objective is to prevent injuries,  protect assets, and create sustainable value across all organizational activities and processes.   c.     Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves  from such risks. (Y/N)      Yes, the Company effectively utilizes the Adani Group's robust Incident Management and Investigation  System to ensure fair and transparent documentation of occupational hazards and risks. This includes unsafe  practices, hazardous conditions, close calls, injuries, diseases, and significant events. A comprehensive  Root Cause Failure Analysis follows, leading to the development and implementation of corrective  measures in line with the Hierarchy of Controls. These measures are then diligently tracked, monitored, and  ultimately resolved.       Insights and lessons learned from these occurrences are shared throughout the Group via a structured  mechanism known as the 'Critical Vulnerable Factor' (CVF), which is integral to the Group's Safety Governance  Process. The progress of CVF initiatives is regularly reviewed at the Adani Apex Group Safety Steering  Council and Business Safety Council Meetings.       Supporting these processes, the Adani Group has introduced a digital platform for Occupational Health and  Safety (OH&S) reporting. This platform is accessible to all company employees and workers through both its  website and a dedicated mobile application.   d.     Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. The well-being and safety of our personnel are of utmost importance to us. To achieve this, we have adopted a  collaborative approach that underscores the shared responsibility. We engage with individuals across all levels  to strengthen a culture of safety across our company's operations. Our goal is to decrease reportable incidents,  reduce injuries, and maintain consistent oversight of our sites' safety performance. At Adani Group, a core tenet of 'Growth with Goodness' is the protection of our people within the 'Zero Harm  culture'. We are dedicated to fostering a 'Culture of Care', ensuring every task is conducted safely, which supports  the ongoing growth and sustainability of our enterprises for a 'Generative Safety Culture' through both 'Top  Down' and 'Bottom Up' approaches. Our initiatives are focused on Three Safety Enablers: 'Organization & Culture', 'Systems & Processes', and  'Equipment & Facilities', which guide us toward the 'Safety Integral Stage' of the Integral Culture Model. Adani Group has implemented extensive Safety Management Systems in line with international standards  and best practices. These systems include policies, procedures, and guidelines designed to identify, evaluate,  and mitigate workplace hazards and risks. They offer a systematic approach to enhance safety awareness  and ensure adherence to safety regulations. All AEL businesses are in compliance with the Group’s Safety  Management Systems. Our organization conducts consistent training and awareness initiatives to provide our employees and contractors  with the essential knowledge and skills required to recognize and mitigate workplace hazards. These initiatives  encompass a range of topics, including safe work practices, emergency response procedures, correct equipment  and machinery handling, and the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE). This year, our Data Center  business has launched several digital projects, such as Virtual Reality-based training for high-risk activities to  increase worker awareness, and AI-based monitoring systems. Meanwhile, our Solar Manufacturing business  under New Energy Ecosystem has established a strong framework to enhance the safety system through seven  distinct task forces, adhering to the Group Safety standards.

Describe the strategy  adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes  and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.   Our waste management strategy is founded on the cradle-to-cradle philosophy, emphasizing the principles of  Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle to reintegrate waste into the ecosystem. This process is organized  into five distinct phases: Identification, Storage, Segregation, Recycling, and Disposal. We implement robust  waste management practices, which constitute a fundamental component of our comprehensive environmental  management system. Additionally, we have instituted a Resource Conservation policy that has been successfully  operationalized across various AEL entities.   In managing hazardous waste, we rigorously comply with all relevant regulatory mandates and adopt  industry-leading practices. This includes meticulous segregation, secure storage, and safe transportation of  hazardous materials. Consistent with regulatory directives, we ensure the environmentally sound disposal of  hazardous waste by engaging certified vendors proficient in recycling such materials.   All of our enterprises are diligently pursuing Zero Waste to Landfill certification where feasible. Alongside hazardous  waste, we manage significant non-hazardous waste streams, including mining overburden, scrap metal, wood,  glass, tires, electronic waste, cardboard, and paper. The overburden is entirely utilized within our mining lease  areas for backfilling and ecological restoration. Our strategic objective is to reduce or eliminate waste production  and divert waste away from disposal by promoting reuse and recycling whenever possible. At Adani Solar, we  sell ETP sludge to other industries for use as raw material. Mumbai Airport has achieved 100% SUP-free status,  certified by CII. At Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, we have implemented an advanced Bioenergy Plant  that converts biogas into electricity with a 15 KVA Biogas Genset, powering airport operations. The resultant  biogas slurry serves as fertilizer for horticultural activities. Furthermore, at Mumbai and Ahmedabad Airports, we  have installed three Reverse Vending Machines to promote recycling among passengers and staff, each capable  of accepting and compressing up to 450 bottles per hour, thereby reducing waste volume by approximately 70%  for efficient transport to recycling facilities.   These initiatives in waste management are part of our commitment to lessen the environmental footprint of our  activities and promote the sustainable utilization of resources. 11.

400 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 To the Members of Adani Enterprises Limited Report on the audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the Standalone Financial Statements  of Adani Enterprises Limited (“the Company”),  which comprise the Standalone Balance Sheet as at  March  31,  2025,  the  Standalone  Statement  of  Profit  and Loss (including other comprehensive income), the  Standalone Statement of Cash Flows and the Standalone  Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended,  and a summary of material accounting policies, notes  forming part of Standalone Financial Statements and  other explanatory information (herein after referred to  as “Standalone Financial Statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid  Standalone Financial Statements give the information  required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in  the manner so required and give a true and fair view  in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards  prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,  as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles  generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of  the Company as at March 31, 2025, the Profit and other  comprehensive Income, changes in equity and its cash  flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing  specified  under  section  143(10)  of  the  Act  Independent Auditor’s Report (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are  further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the  audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section  of our report. We are independent of the Company  in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”)  together with the independence requirements that  are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements under the provisions of the Act and the  Rules  made  there  under,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that  the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Standalone Financial Statements. Emphasis of Matter We draw your attention to Note 56 to the accompanying  Standalone Financial Statements, which describes the  matter related to Short Seller Report (‘SSR’) published  during  the  financial  year  ended  March  31,  2023.  Based on legal opinions, legal and accounting review and  management’s assessment thereon, the management is  of the view that there is no material consequence of the  allegations mentioned in the SSR and other allegations  on the Company. Our opinion is not modified in respect  of the above matter. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in our  audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the  current year. These matters were addressed in the context  of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a  whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 401 We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 1 Contingencies relating to taxation, litigations and  arbitrations The provisions and contingent liabilities relate to  ongoing litigations, disputes and claims with various  authorities and third parties. These relate to direct  tax, indirect tax, claims and other legal proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of business. As at the  year ended March 31, 2025, the amounts involved  were significant. The assessment of a provision or a  contingent  liability  requires  significant  judgement  by the management of the Company because of the  inherent complexity in estimating future costs. The  amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate  of the expenditure. The provisions and contingent  liabilities are subject to changes in the outcomes of  litigations and claims and the positions taken by the  management of the Company. It involves significant  judgement and estimation to determine the likelihood  and timing of the cash outflows and interpretations  of the legal aspects, tax legislations and judgements  previously made by authorities.  Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding of the process  followed by the management of the Company for  assessment and determination of the amounts  of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to  taxation, litigations and arbitrations. We have made inquiries about the status in respect  of  significant  provisions  and  contingent  liabilities  with the Company’s internal tax and legal team,  including challenging the assumptions and critical  judgements made by the Company which impacted  the computation of the provisions and inspecting the  computation. We assessed management’s conclusions through  discussions held with their in-house legal counsel  and understanding precedents in similar cases. We  communicated with the Company’s external legal  counsel on the certain material litigations to establish  the likelihood of outflow of economic resources  being probable, possible or remote in respect of the  litigations. We have involved subject matter experts with  specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the  assessment  of  the  value  of  significant  provisions  and contingent liabilities relating to the pending  litigations, on sample basis, in light of the nature of  the exposures, applicable regulations and related  correspondence with the authorities. We also assessed and validated the adequacy and  appropriateness of the disclosures made by the  management in the Standalone Financial Statements. 2 Timing of Revenue recognition and adjustments for  coal quality variances involving critical estimates Material estimation by the Company is involved in  recognition and measurement of its revenue. The  value and timing of revenue recognition for sale  of goods varies from contract to contract, and the  activity can span beyond the year end. Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when  control is transferred to the customers and when  there are no other unfulfilled obligations. This requires  detailed analysis of each sale agreement/ contract / customer purchase order regarding timing of revenue  recognition. Inappropriate assessment could lead to a risk of  revenue being recognized on sale of goods before the  control in the goods is transferred to the customer. Principal Audit Procedures We have assessed the Company’s accounting policies  for revenue recognition in accordance with Ind AS 115; We have conducted testing of design, implementation  and operating effectiveness of key internal financial  controls over timing of recognition of revenue from  sale of goods and subsequent adjustments made to  the transaction price; We have also performed substantive audit procedures  on selected statistical samples of customer contracts,  verified terms and condition related to acceptance of  goods, acknowledgement on delivery receipts and  tested the transit time to deliver the goods and its  revenue recognition. Our tests of details focused on  period end samples to verify only revenue pertaining  to current year is recognized based on terms and 

402 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response Subsequent adjustments are made to the transaction  price due to grade mismatch/slippage of the  transferred goods (coal). The variation in the contract  price if not settled mutually between the parties to  the contract is referred to third party testing and  the Company estimates the adjustments required  for revenue recognition pending settlement of such  dispute. Such adjustments in revenue are made on  estimated basis following historical trend. Inappropriate estimation could lead to a risk of revenue  being overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, timing  of recognition of revenue and adjustments for coal  quality variances involving critical estimates is a key  audit matter. conditions set out in sale agreements/ contracts  and delivery documents. We have assessed the  appropriateness of the estimated adjustments in the  process. We also performed tests to establish the basis  of estimation of the consideration and whether such  estimates are commensurate with the accounting  policy of the Company. We have reviewed the calculations and adequacy of  the provision for coal quality variances. We verified  the methodology used for estimating the provision  and assessed the reasonableness of assumption. We have assessed the adequacy of disclosure in the  Standalone Financial Statements. 3 Measurement of inventory quantities of coal As at March 31, 2025 the Company has coal inventory  of  `  1,615.43 crore. This was determined a key audit  matter, as the measurement of these inventory  quantities lying at the ports/ yards involves significant  judgement and estimate resulting from measuring the  surface area. The Company uses internal and external  experts, to perform volumetric assessments, basis  which the quantity for these inventories is estimated. Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding and have  evaluated the design and operating effectiveness  of controls over physical count and measurement of  such inventory; We have evaluated the competency and capabilities  of  management’s  experts  for  quantification  of  the  inventories. We have physically observed inventory measurement  and count procedures carried out by management  using experts on sample basis, spanning over the  engagement period, to ensure its appropriateness and  completeness; and Our audit procedures also included obtaining and  inspecting, inventory measurement and physical  count results for such inventories, including assessing  and evaluating the results of analysis performed by  management in respect of differences between book  and physical quantities. We have also verified that  the physical verification differences are appropriately  accounted for in the books of accounts.

The  management assesses at least annually the existence  of impairment indicators of each shareholding in such  subsidiaries, associate and jointly controlled entities. The process and methodologies for assessing  and determining the recoverable amount of each  investments are based on the complex assumptions,  that by their nature imply the use of management’s  judgement, in particular with reference to  identification  of  impairment  indicators,  forecasting  future cashflow relating to period covered by the  Company’s strategic business plan, normalized  cashflow assumed as a basis for terminal values, as  well as the long term growth rates and discount rates  applied to such forecasted cash flow. Considering the judgement required for estimating  the cash flows and complexity of the assumptions  used, this is considered as a key audit matter. Principal Audit Procedures We obtained understanding of the Company’s policy  on assessment of impairment of investment in  subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities  and assumptions used by the management including  design and implementation of controls. We have  tested operating effectiveness of those controls. We have assessed the methodology used by the  management of the Company to estimate recoverable  value of each investment and consistency with Ind AS  36 Impairment of Assets and, where applicable, Ind AS  113 Fair Value Measurement. We compared the carrying value of the Company’s  investment in these subsidiaries, associates and  jointly controlled entities with their respective net  asset values as per the audited financial statements.  In cases where fair value less costs of disposal was  used as the recoverable amount, we assessed the  basis of fair value determination, including market  participant assumptions, valuation model, and input  data used. With respect to the cases where indicators of  impairment  were  identified  by  the  management,  we obtained the projected future cash flows along  with sensitivity analysis thereof with respect to  relevant investments. We evaluated management’s  methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the  calculation and have involved subject matter expert  internally to evaluate the appropriateness of the  assumptions used. We evaluated the appropriateness of its accounting  and the disclosures, if any, for the impairment of  investment in subsidiaries, associates, and jointly  controlled entities. Information other than Standalone Financial  Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon The Company’s management and board of directors are  responsible for the preparation of the other information.  The other information comprises the information  included in the management discussion and analysis,  board’s report including annexures to board’s report,  business responsibility and sustainability report,  corporate governance, tax transparency report and  shareholder’s information, but does not include the  Standalone Financial Statements, consolidated financial  statement and our audit reports thereon. Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information and, in doing so, consider whether the  other information is materially inconsistent with the  Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge  obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise  appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the  work we have performed, we conclude that there is a  material misstatement of this other information, we are  required to report that fact. We have nothing to report  in this regard. 

404 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Management’s and Board of Director’s  Responsibility for the Standalone Financial  Statements The Company’s management and the board of directors  are responsible for the matters stated in Section  134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and  presentation of these Standalone Financial Statements  that give a true and fair view of the financial position,  financial  performance  including  other  comprehensive  income, cash flows and changes in equity of the  Company in accordance with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India, including the applicable  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under  Section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the  provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of  the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds  and other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and  estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial  controls,  that  were  operating  effectively  for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements  that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the  management and the board of directors are responsible  for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related  to going concern and using the going concern basis  of accounting unless management either intends to  liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no  realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing  the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibility for the audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as  a whole are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high  level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of these Standalone  Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control.    Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act,  we are also responsible for expressing our opinion  on whether the Company has adequate internal  financial controls system in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls.    Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management.    Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s  use of the going concern basis of accounting and,  based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Company to cease to  continue as a going concern.    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the financial statements  represent the underlying transactions and events in  a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 405 including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial Statements of the current year and are  therefore the key audit matters. We describe these  matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation  precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that  a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication.

414 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Report on the Internal Financial Controls  under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of section  143 of the Companies Act 2013 (the Act). We  have  audited  the  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  of  Adani  Enterprises  Limited  (“the  Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with  our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the  Company for the year ended on that date. Management’s and Board of Director’s  Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors  are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal  financial  controls  based  on  the  internal  control  over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by  the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).  These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the  orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including  adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and  errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company's  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in  accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the  Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by  ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10)  of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to  an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting was established and maintained and if such  controls operated effectively in all material respects. Annexure – B to the Independent Auditor’s Report (Referred to in Paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our  Report of even date) Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls  system  over  financial  reporting  and  their  operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based  on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend  on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone  Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial  controls system over financial reporting with reference  to Standalone Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A  company's  internal  financial  control  over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal  financial  control over financial reporting includes those policies  and procedures that (1)     pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2)    provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of  financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and expenditures of the company are being  made only in accordance with authorizations of  management and directors of the company; and (3)     provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,  or disposition of the company's assets that could  have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 415 Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur  and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting  to future years are subject to the risk that the internal  financial control over financial reporting may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion the Company has, in all material aspects,  an  adequate  internal  financial  controls  system  over  financial reporting and such internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  were  operating  effectively  as  at March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India.

422 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 1.   Corporate Information     Adani Enterprises Limited (‘the Company’, ‘AEL’)  is a listed public company domiciled in India and  incorporated under the provisions of Companies  Act,  1956,  having  its  registered  office  at  “Adani  Corporate House”, Shantigram, Near Vaishno  Devi Circle, S. G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad -  382421, Gujarat, India. Its shares are listed on the  BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India  Limited. The Company is in the business of integrated  resources management, mining services and other  trading activities. The Company operates as an  incubator, establishing new businesses in various  areas like new energy ecosystem, data center,  airports, roads, copper, digital space and others. 2.   Material Accounting Policies I   Basis of Preparation a)   Statement of Compliance     The financial statements of the Company have been  prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) notified under section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  amended from time to time and other accounting  principles generally accepted in India.     These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under the historical cost convention with the  exception of certain assets and liabilities that are  required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS.     The financial statements are presented in INR except  when otherwise stated. All amounts have been  rounded-off to the nearest crore, unless otherwise  indicated and amounts less than  `  50,000/- have  been presented as "0.00". b)     Significant  accounting  judgements,  accounting  estimates and assumptions     The  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires  management to make certain judgements, estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of  revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (including  contingent liabilities) and the accompanying  disclosures. Estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis.   Key sources of estimation uncertainty     The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  years, are described below. Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments may  change due to market changes or circumstances  arising that are beyond the control of the Company.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur.     Material estimates and assumptions are required  in particular for:   i)     Useful life of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets:       This involves determination of the estimated  useful life of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets and the assessment  as to which components of the cost may be  capitalised. Useful life of these assets is based  on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical  estimates, taking into account the nature of  the asset, estimated usage, expected residual  values, anticipated technological changes,  maintenance support and operating conditions  of the asset. Management reviews its estimate  of the useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable  assets at each reporting date, based on the  expected utility of the assets.   ii)   Impairment of Non Financial Asset :       Impairment exists when the carrying value  of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds  its recoverable amount, which is the higher  of its fair value less costs of disposal and  its value in use. The fair value less costs of  disposal calculation is based on available data  for similar assets or observable market prices  less incremental costs for disposing of the  asset. The value in use calculation is based  on a discounted future cashflows model.  The recoverable amount is sensitive to the  discount rate used for the discounted future  cashflows model as well as the expected future  cash-inflows and the growth rate used. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 423 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   iii)   Taxes:       The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India.  Significant  judgements  are  involved  in  estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of  paying advance tax, determining the provision  for income taxes, including amount expected to  be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.  Significant  management  judgement  is  also  required to determine the amount of deferred  tax assets that can be recognised, based upon  the likely timing and the level of future taxable  profits  together  with  future  tax  planning  strategies, including estimates of temporary  differences reversing on account of available  benefits from the Income Tax Act, 1961.   iv)     Fair  value  measurement  of  financial    instruments:       In estimating the fair value of financial assets  and  financial  liabilities,  the  Company  uses  market observable data to the extent available.  Where such Level 1 inputs are not available,  the Company establishes appropriate valuation  techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not  feasible, a degree of judgment is required in  establishing fair values. Judgments include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in  assumptions about these factors could affect  the reported fair value of financial instruments.   v)   Defined benefit plans (Gratuity Benefits):       The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan  and the present value of the gratuity obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include  the determination of the discount rate, future  salary increases, attrition rate and mortality  rates. Due to the complexities involved in the  valuation and its long-term nature, a defined  benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in these assumptions. All assumptions are  reviewed at each reporting date.   vi)   Inventory Measurement       Measurement of bulk inventory quantities of  coal lying at port/ yards is material, complex and  involves  significant  judgement  and  estimate  resulting from measuring the surface area.  The Company performs physical counts of above  inventory on a periodic basis using internal /  external experts to perform volumetric surveys  and assessments, basis which the estimate of  quantity for these inventories is determined.  The variations noted between book records and  physical quantities of above inventories are  evaluated and appropriately accounted in the  books of accounts.   vii)   Determination of lease term & discount rate :       Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine  the lease term as the non-cancellable period of  a lease adjusted with any option to extend or  terminate the lease, if the use of such option  is reasonably certain. The Company makes  assessment on the expected lease term on lease  by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it  is reasonably certain that any options to extend  or terminate the contract will be exercised.  In evaluating the lease term, the Company  considers  factors  such  as  any  significant  leasehold improvements undertaken over the  lease term, costs relating to the termination  of lease and the importance of the underlying  to the Company’s operations taking into  account the location of the underlying asset  and the availability of the suitable alternatives.  The lease term in future periods is reassessed to  ensure that the lease term reflects the current  economic circumstances.       The discount rate is generally based on the  incremental  borrowing  rate  specific  to  the  lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases  with similar characteristics.   viii)   Asset Retirement Obligation:       The liability for asset retirement obligations  are recognised when the Company has an  obligation to perform site restoration activity.  The recognition and measurement of asset  retirement obligations involves the use of  

424 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of  abandonment of site facilities which would  depend upon the ultimate life of the project,  expected utilization of assets in other projects,  the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax  rate applied for discounting.   ix)     Recognition and measurement of Contingent  liabilities, provisions and uncertain tax positions:       There are various legal, direct and indirect tax  matters and other obligations including local  and state levies, availing input tax credits etc.,  which may impact the Company. Evaluation of  uncertain liabilities and contingent liabilities  arising out of above matters and recognition  and measurement of other provisions are based  on the assessment of the probability of an  outflow of resources, and on past experience  and circumstances known at the balance sheet  date. The actual outflow of resources at a  future date may therefore vary from the figure  included in other provisions. c)   Current & Non-Current Classification     Any asset or liability is classified as current if it  satisfies any of the following conditions:   i)     The asset/liability is expected to be realized/ settled in the Company’s normal operating cycle;   ii)   The asset is intended for sale or consumption;   iii)     The asset/liability is held primarily for the  purpose of trading;   iv)     The asset/liability is expected to be realized/ settled within twelve months after the  reporting period;   v)     The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it  is restricted from being exchanged or used to  settle a liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date;   vi)     In the case of a liability, the Company does not  have an unconditional right to defer settlement  of the liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date.     All  other  assets  and  liabilities  are  classified  as  non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities  are  classified  as  non-current  assets  and  liabilities respectively.     For the purpose of current/non-current  classification of assets and liabilities, the Company  has ascertained its normal operating cycle as twelve  months. This is based on the nature of services  and the time between the acquisition of assets or  inventories for processing and their realization in  cash and cash equivalents. II   Summary of Material Accounting Policies a)   Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation i)   Functional and presentation currency     The financial statements are presented in Indian  Rupee (INR), which is entity's functional and  presentation currency. ii)   Transactions and Balances     Foreign currency transactions are translated into  the functional currency, for initial recognition, using  the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.     All foreign currency denominated monetary assets  and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates  on the reporting date. Exchange differences arising  on settlement or translation of monetary items are  recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss except  to the extent of exchange differences which are  regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on  foreign currency borrowings that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or construction of  qualifying assets which are capitalised as cost of  assets. Non-monetary items that are measured in  terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are  not retranslated. b)     Non Current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued  Operations     The  Company  classifies  Non  Current  assets  (or  disposal group) and operations as held for sale or  as discontinued operations if their carrying amounts  will be recovered principally through a sale rather  than  through  continuing  use.  Classification  as  a discontinued operations occurs upon disposal  or when the operation meets the below criteria,  whichever is earlier.     Non Current Assets are classified as held for sale  only when both the conditions are satisfied – 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 425 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   1.    The sale is highly probable, and   2.      The asset or disposal group is available for  immediate sale in its present condition subject  only to terms that are usual and customary for  sale of such assets.     Non-current assets which are subject to  depreciation are not depreciated or amortized once  those classified as held for sale.     A discontinued operation is a component of the  Company's business, the operations of which can  be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of  the Company and   i)     is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose  of a separate major line of business or  geographical area of operations; or   ii)     is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a  view to resale.     Non-current assets and disposal groups classified  as held for sale are measured at the lower of their  carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.  Assets and associated liabilities classified as held for  sale are presented separately in the balance sheet.  The results of discontinued operations are excluded  from the overall results of the Company and are  presented separately as a single amount in the  statement of profit and loss. Also, the comparative  statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the  operations had been discontinued from the start of  the comparative period. c)   Cash & Cash Equivalents     Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit  with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term  balances (with an original maturity of three months  or less from the date of acquisition), that are readily  convertible into known amounts of cash and which  are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. d)   Property, Plant and Equipment   Recognition and Measurement     Property, Plant and Equipment, including Capital  Work in Progress, are stated at cost of acquisition  or construction less accumulated depreciation and  impairment losses, if any. Borrowing cost relating  to acquisition / construction of Property, Plant and  Equipment which takes substantial period of time  to get ready for its intended use are also included to  the extent they relate to the period till such assets  are ready to be put to use.     The present value of the expected cost for the  decommissioning of an asset after its use is included  in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition  criteria for a provision are met.     If significant parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, then they are  accounted for as separate items (major components)  of property, plant and equipment.     The Company has elected to regard previous GAAP  carrying values of property, plant and equipment  as deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e. April 1, 2015.   Subsequent Measurement     Subsequent expenditure related to an item of  Property, Plant and Equipment are included in its  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,  as appropriate, only when it is probable that the  future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Company and the cost of the item  can be measured reliably. Subsequent costs are  depreciated over the residual life of the respective  assets. All other expenses on existing Property,  Plant and Equipment, including day-to-day  repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of  replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of  Profit and Loss for the period during which such  expenses are incurred.   Capital Work in Progress     Expenditure related to and incurred during  implementation of capital projects to get the assets  ready for intended use is included under “Capital  Work in Progress”. The same is allocated to the  respective items of property plant and equipment on  completion of construction/ erection of the capital  project/ property plant and equipment. The cost of  asset not ready for its intended use before the year  end & capital inventory are disclosed under capital  work in progress.   Depreciation     Depreciation is provided using straight-line method  as  specified  in  Schedule  II  to  the  Companies  Act, 2013 or based on technical estimates.  

426 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Depreciation on assets added / disposed off during  the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference  to the date of addition / disposal.   Derecognition     An item of property, plant and equipment is  derecognised upon disposal or when no future  economic  benefits  are  expected  to  arise  from  continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising  on the disposal or retirement of property, plant  and equipment is determined as the difference  between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount  of the assets and is recognised in Statement of  Profit and Loss. e)   Investment Properties   i)     Assets which are held for long-term rental  yields or for capital appreciation or both,  are  classified  as  Investment  Properties.  Investment properties are measured initially at  cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to  initial recognition, investment properties are  stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment loss, if any.       The Company has elected to regard previous  GAAP carrying values of investment properties  as deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind  AS i.e. April 1, 2015.   ii)     The Company depreciates investment  properties over their estimated useful lives, as  specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act,    2013.   iii)     Investment properties are derecognised either  when they have been disposed off or when  they are permanently withdrawn from use and  no future economic benefit is expected from  their disposal. The difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of  the asset is recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss in the period in which the property  is derecognised. f)   Intangible Assets   i)     Intangible assets are measured on initial  recognition at cost and are subsequently  carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment  losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles  are not capitalised.       Mine Development Assets include expenses  pertaining to land and mine development,  initial overburden removal, environmental and  other regulatory approvals etc. It represents  expenses incurred towards development of  mines where the Company is operating as  operator and developer.       The Company has elected to regard previous  GAAP carrying values of intangible assets as  deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e. April 1, 2015.   ii)     The  intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  are  amortised over the useful economic life and  assessed for impairment whenever there is an  indication that the intangible asset may be  impaired. The Company reviews amortisation  period on an annual basis.       Intangible assets are amortised on straight line  basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Intangible Assets Estimated Useful Life  (Years) Software  applications 3-5 Years based on  management estimate Mine Development  Assets Over a period of  underlying contract   iii)    Gains or losses arising from derecognition  of an intangible asset are measured as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset and are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  when the asset is derecognised.     Intangible Assets under Development       Expenditure incurred during development of  intangible assets is included under “Intangible  Assets under Development”. The same is  allocated to the respective items of intangible  assets on completion of the project. g)   Impairment of Non-Financial Assets     At the end of each reporting period, the Group  reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and  intangible assets to determine whether there is  any indication that those assets have suffered  an impairment loss. If any such indication exists,    the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 427 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 in order to determine the extent of the impairment    loss (if any).     Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing  the recoverable amount of CGU to which such  goodwill relates.     If the recoverable amount of an asset (or  cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced  to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss  is recognised immediately in the Statement of  Profit or Loss.     Assets (other than goodwill) for which impairment  loss has been recognised in prior periods, the  Company reviews at each reporting date whether  there is any indication that the loss has decreased  or no longer exists. When an impairment loss  subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the  asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the  revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that  the increased carrying amount does not exceed the  carrying amount that would have been determined  had no impairment loss been recognised. A reversal  of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in  Statement of Profit and Loss.     Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing  the recoverable amount of CGU to which such  goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the  CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment  loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to  goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. h)    Investment in Subsidiaries, Jointly Controlled  Entities, Associates and Unincorporated Entities     Investment in Subsidiaries, Joint Controlled  Entities and Associates are measured at cost less  impairment in accordance with Ind AS 27 "Separate  Financial Statements".     In case of unincorporated entities in the nature  of a Joint Operation, the Company recognizes its  direct right and its share of jointly held or incurred  assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues  and expenses of joint operations. These have been  incorporated in these financial statements under  the appropriate headings. i)   Financial Instruments     A financial instrument is any contract that gives  rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial  liability or equity instrument of another entity.     Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables  which are measured at transaction price.     The financial assets comprise of trade receivables,  cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances  and deposits, interest accrued, security deposits,  intercorporate deposits, contract assets and  other receivables. These assets are measured  subsequently at amortised cost.     The  financial  liabilities  comprise  of  borrowings,  lease liabilities, retention and capital creditors,  interest accrued, deposit from customers, trade and  other payables.     Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset  when the Company has a legally enforceable right  (not contingent on future events) to off-set the  recognised amounts either to settle on a net basis,  or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities  simultaneously.     An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments  issued by the Company are recognised at the  proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.   A)   Financial Assets    Initial  Recognition       All financial assets, except trade receivables,  are initially recognised at fair value.    Subsequent  Measurement     Business Model Assessment       The Company makes an assessment of the  objectives of the business model in which a  financial asset is held because it best reflects  the way business is managed and information  is provided to management. The assessment  of business model comprises the stated  policies and objectives of the financial assets,  management strategy for holding the financial  assets, the risk that affects the performance  

428 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 etc. Further management also evaluates  whether the contractual cash flows are solely  payment of principal and interest considering  the contractual terms of the instrument.         The  subsequent  measurement  of  financial  assets  depends  on  their  classification,  as  described below:   1)    At amortised cost       A financial asset is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met :     (a)      The asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for  collecting contractual cash flows, and     (b)      Contractual terms of the asset give rise, on  specified dates, to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.       After initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into  account any discount or premium on acquisition  and fees or costs that are an integral part of  the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in  finance income in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. The losses arising from impairment are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  This category generally applies to trade and  other receivables.       The effective interest rate is the rate that  exactly discounts estimated future cash  receipts (including all fees and transaction costs  and other premiums or discounts) through the  expected life of the financial assets, or where  appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross  carrying amount on initial recognition.   2)     At Fair Value through Other Comprehensive  Income (FVTOCI)       A financial asset is classified as at the FVTOCI if  both of the following criteria are met:     (a)     The objective of the business model  is achieved both by collecting  contractual cash flows and selling the  financial assets, and     (b)     Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.       Debt instruments included within the  FVTOCI category are measured initially as  well as at each reporting date at fair value.  Fair value movements are recognised in the  Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and on  derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously  recognised in OCI is reclassified to Statement  of Profit and Loss. For equity instruments, the  Company may make an irrevocable election to  present subsequent changes in the fair value  in OCI. If the Company decides to classify an  equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair  value changes on the instrument, excluding  dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no  recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement  of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment.   3)    At Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL)       Financial assets which are not measured at  amortised cost or FVTOCI and are held for  trading are measured at FVTPL.       In addition, the Company may elect to designate  a debt instrument, which otherwise meets  amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.  However, such election is allowed only if doing  so reduces or eliminates a measurement or  recognition inconsistency (referred to as  ‘accounting mismatch’).    Equity  investments       All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109  are measured at fair value. The Company may  make an irrevocable election to present in other  comprehensive income subsequent changes  in the fair value. The Company makes such  election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.  The classification is made on initial recognition  and is irrevocable.       If the Company decides to classify an equity  instrument as FVTOCI, then all fair value  changes on the instrument, excluding  dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no  recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and  loss, even on sale of investment. However, the  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 429 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Company may transfer the cumulative gain or  loss within equity.       Equity instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognised in the profit and loss.    Derecognition       On  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset,  the  difference between the asset’s carrying amount  and the sum of the consideration received and  receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that  had been recognised in other comprehensive  income and accumulated in equity is recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss if such gain or  loss would have otherwise been recognised in  Statement of Profit and Loss on disposal of that  financial asset.     Impairment of financial assets       The Company applies Expected Credit Loss  (ECL) model for measurement and recognition  of impairment loss on the financial assets and  credit risk exposure. The Company assesses  on a forward looking basis the expected credit  losses associated with its receivables based on  historical trends and past experience.       The Company follows 'Simplified Approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on all  trade receivables or contractual receivables.       ECL is the difference between all contracted  cash flows that are due to the Company in  accordance with the contract and all the cash  flows that the Company expects to receive,  discounted at the original EIR. ECL impairment  loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during  the period is recognised as income / (expense)  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   B)   Financial Liabilities       Financial  liabilities  are  classified,  at  initial  recognition as at amortised cost or fair value  through  profit  or  loss.  The  measurement  of  financial  liabilities  depends  on  their  classification, as described below:   1)    At amortised cost       This is the category most relevant to the  Company.  After  initial  recognition,  financial  liabilities are subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and  losses are recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised  as well as through the EIR amortisation process.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into  account any discount or premium on acquisition  and fees or costs that are an integral part of the  EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance  costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.       The effective interest method is a method of  calculating the amortised cost of a financial  liability and of allocating interest expense over  the relevant period. The effective interest rate  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash payments (including all fees and  points paid or received that form an integral  part of the effective interest rate, transaction  costs and other premiums or discounts) through  the expected life of the financial liability, or  (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net  carrying amount on initial recognition.   2)    At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)       Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or  loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for  trading  and  financial  liabilities  designated  upon initial recognition as such. Subsequently,  any changes in fair value are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.     Derecognition of Financial Liability       A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged  or cancelled or expires. An exchange  with a lender of debt instruments with  substantially different terms is accounted for  as an extinguishment of the original financial  liability and the recognition of a new financial  liability.  Similarly,  a  substantial  modification  of the terms of an existing financial liability  is accounted for as an extinguishment of the  original financial liability and the recognition of  a new financial liability. 

430 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   C)   Derivative financial instruments     Initial recognition and subsequent    measurement       The  Company  uses  derivative  financial  instruments such as forward and options  currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency  risks. Such derivative financial instruments are  initially recognised and subsequently measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  (FVTPL).  Derivatives  are  carried  as  financial  assets  when the fair value is positive and as financial  liabilities when the fair value is negative.       Any gains or losses arising from changes in the  fair  value  of  derivative  financial  instrument  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/ (loss). Changes in fair value and gains/(losses)  on settlement of foreign currency derivative  financial  instruments  relating  to  borrowings,  which have not been designated as hedge are  recorded as finance cost. j)   Income Taxes     Income tax expense comprises current tax expense  and the net change in the deferred tax asset or  liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes  are  recognised  in  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in which case, the current and deferred tax are  also recognised in other comprehensive income or  directly in equity, respectively. i)   Current Tax     Current income tax assets and liabilities are  measured at the amount expected to be  recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.  Current income tax(including Minimum Alternate  Tax (MAT)) is measured at the amount expected to  be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with  the Income-Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India. The tax  rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are  those that are enacted or substantially enacted, at  the reporting date.     Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  is  recognised  outside  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss (either in other comprehensive income (OCI)  or in equity). Management periodically evaluates  positions taken in the tax returns with respect to  situations in which applicable tax regulations are  subject to interpretation and establishes provisions  where appropriate. ii)   Deferred Tax     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for deductible and taxable temporary differences  arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities  and their carrying amount, except when the deferred  tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset  or liability in a transaction that is not a business  combination and affects neither accounting nor  taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.     Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent  that it is probable that taxable profit will be available  against which the deductible temporary differences,  and the carry forward of unused tax credits and  unused tax losses can be utilised.     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  year when the asset is realised or the liability is  settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date.     Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. The Company  recognises tax credits in the nature of MAT credit as  an asset only to the extent that there is convincing  evidence that the Company will pay normal income  tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for  which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward.  In the year in which the Company recognises tax  credits as an asset, the said asset is created by way  of tax credit to the statement of profit and loss.  The Company reviews such tax credit asset at each  reporting date to assess its recoverability. k)   Inventories   i)     Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net  realisable value.   ii)     Cost of inventories have been computed to  include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion,  all non-refundable duties & taxes and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition.   iii)     The basis of calculating cost for traded goods  and stores and spares is weighted average cost  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 431 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 method. For certain categories of traded goods  it is determined based on weighted average  cost of respective commodity lot basis.   iv)     Net realisable value is the estimated selling  price in the ordinary course of business,  less estimated cost of completion and  estimated cost necessary to make the sale.  Necessary adjustment for shortage / excess  stock is given based on the available evidence  and past experience of the Company. l)     Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets     Provisions are recognised for when the Company has  at present, legal or contractual obligation as a result  of past events, only if it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic outgo or loss  will be required and if the amount involved can be  measured reliably. If the effect of the time value of  money is material, provisions are discounted using a  current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate,  the risks specific to the liability. When discounting  is used, the increase in the provision due to the  passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.  The Company recognises provision for asset  retirement obligation in accordance with the mining  services contract.     Contingent liabilities being a possible obligation  as a result of past events, the existence of which  will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non  occurrence of one or more future events not wholly  in control of the Company are not recognised in  the accounts. The nature of such liabilities and an  estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in notes  to the financial statements.     Contingent assets are not recognised in the  financial statements. The nature of such assets and  an estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in  notes to the financial statements. m)   Revenue Recognition     Revenue from contract with customer is recognised  upon transfer of control of promised products or  services to customers on complete satisfaction of  performance obligations for an amount that reflects  the consideration which the Company expects to  receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is measured based on the transaction price,  which is the consideration, adjusted for discounts  and other incentives, if any, as per contracts with the  customers. Revenue also excludes taxes or amounts  collected from customers in its capacity as agent.     The specific recognition criteria from various stream  of revenue is described below:   (i)   Sale of Goods       Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when  the Company transfers control of the goods,  generally on delivery, or when the goods have  been dispatched to the customer's specified  location as per the terms of contract, provided  the company has not retained any significant  risk of ownership or future obligation with  respect to the goods dispatched.   (ii)   Rendering of Services       Revenue from handling services, mining  services and other services are recognized in  the period in which the services are transferred  to the customer at an amount that reflects the  consideration to which the Company expects  to be entitled in exchange for those services.       Revenue from services rendered is recognised  when the work is performed as per the  performance  obligations  specified  in  the  customer agreements.   (iii)   Dividends       Revenue is recognised when the Company’s  right to receive the payment is established,  which is generally when shareholders  approve the dividend.   (iv)   Interest Income       Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by  reference to the principal outstanding and at  the effective interest rate applicable, which  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash receipts through the expected  life of the financial asset to that asset's net  carrying amount on initial recognition.    Contract  Assets       A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Company performs by  

432 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 transferring goods or services to a customer  before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that is  conditional. The same is disclosed under Other  Current Financial Assets.    Trade  Receivable       A receivable represents the Company's right to  an amount of consideration that is unconditional  i.e. only the passage of time is required before  payment of consideration is due.    Contract  Liability       A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which  the Company has received consideration (or  an amount of consideration is due) from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as  revenue when the Company performs under the  contract. The same is disclosed under Other  Current Liabilities. n)   Employee Benefits     Employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated  absences, contribution to provident fund, employees'  state insurance and superannuation fund.   i)   Short Term Employee Benefits       Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve  months of rendering the services are classified  as short term employee benefits and recognised  in the period in which the employee renders  the related service. These are recognised at the  undiscounted amount of the benefits expected  to be paid in exchange for that service.   ii)   Post Employment Benefits     Defined Contribution Plans       Retirement benefits in the form of provident  fund  and  superannuation  fund  are  defined  contribution schemes. The Company has no  obligation, other than the contribution payable  to the provident fund. The Company recognises  contribution payable to the these funds as  an expense, when an employee renders the  related service. If the contribution payable to  the scheme for service received before the  balance sheet date exceeds the contribution  already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme  is recognised as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid.     Defined Benefit Plans       The  Company  operates  a  defined  benefit  gratuity plan in India, in which contributions  are maintained to a separately administered  fund.  The  cost  of  providing  benefits  under  the defined benefit plan is determined based  on actuarial valuation, carried out by an  independent actuary, using the projected  unit credit method. The liability for gratuity is  funded annually to a gratuity funds maintained  with the Life Insurance Corporation of India  and SBI Life Insurance Company Limited.       Re-measurements gains and losses arising  from experience adjustments, changes in  actuarial assumptions and the return on plan  assets (excluding net interest) are recognised  immediately in the balance sheet with a  corresponding debit or credit to retained  earnings through other comprehensive  income in the period in which they occur.  Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit  or loss in subsequent periods. Net interest is  calculated by applying the discount rate to the  net balance of defined benefit liability or asset.       The Company recognises the following changes  in  the  net  defined  benefit  obligation  as  an  expense in the statement of profit and loss in  the line item "Employee Benefits Expense":    Service cost including current service  cost, past service cost, gains and  losses on curtailments and non-routine  settlements; and    Net interest expense or income.   iii)   Other Employee Benefits       Other  employee  benefits  comprise  of  compensated absences / leaves. The actuarial  valuation is done as per projected unit credit  method. Remeasurements as a result of  experience adjustments and changes in  actuarial assumptions are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 433 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   iv)     For  the  purpose  of  presentation  of  defined  benefit  plans  and  other  long  term  benefits,  the allocation between current and  non-current provisions has been made as  determined by an actuary. o)   Borrowing Costs     Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of a  qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial  period of time to get ready for its intended use or  sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.  Borrowing costs consist of interest and transaction  costs that an entity incurs in connection with the  borrowing of funds. Transaction costs in respect of  long-term borrowings are amortised over the tenor  of respective loans using effective interest method.  All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period  in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs also  includes exchange differences arising from foreign  currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded  as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. p)   Leases     The Company assesses whether a contract contains  a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract  is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the  right to control the use of an identified asset for a  period of time in exchange for consideration.   Company as a lessee     The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and  a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,  which comprises the initial amount of the lease  liability adjusted for any lease payments made at  or before the commencement date, plus any initial  direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to  dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to  restore the site on which it is located, less any lease  incentives received.     Certain lease arrangements include the option to  extend or terminate the lease before the end of  the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease  liabilities include these options when it is reasonably  certain that the option will be exercised.     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using the straight-line method from the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of  the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end  of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset  is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,  and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the  lease liability.     The lease liability is initially measured at the present  value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be  readily determined, the Company’s incremental  borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.     The lease liability is subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest method.  It is remeasured when there is a change in future  lease payments arising from a change in an index or  rate, if there is a change in the Company’s estimate  of the amount expected to be payable under a  residual value guarantee, or if there is a change in  the lease payments or a change in the assessment  of an option to purchase the underlying asset.     For a lease modification that is not a separate lease,  at the effective date of the modification, the lessee  accounts for the lease modification by remeasuring  the lease liability using a discount rate determined  at that date and the lessee makes a corresponding  adjustment to the right-of-use asset.     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero.     Lease payments have been classified as financing  activities in Statement of Cash Flow.     The Company has elected not to recognise right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases  that have a lease term of less than or equal to 12  months with no purchase option and assets with  low value leases. The Company recognises the  lease payments associated with these leases as an  expense in statement of profit and loss over the  lease term. The related cash flows are classified as  operating activities. 

434 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   Company as a lessor     Leases in which the Company does not transfer  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  of  an  asset  are  classified  as  operating  leases.  Rental income from operating lease is recognised  on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant  lease. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in  the period in which they are earned.     Leases  are  classified  as  finance  leases  when  substantially all of the risks and rewards of  ownership transfer from the Company to the lessee.  Amounts  due  from  lessees  under  finance  leases  are recorded as receivables at the Companies net  investment in the leases. Finance lease income  is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect  a constant periodic rate of return on the net  investment outstanding in respect of the lease. q)   Earnings Per Share     Basic  EPS  is  computed  by  dividing  the  profit  or  loss attributable to the owners of the Company  by the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed  by  dividing  the  profit  or  loss  attributable  to  the  owners of the Company (after adjusting for costs  associated with dilutive potential equity shares)  by the weighted average number of equity shares  and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding  during the year. r)   Service Work in Progress     Service Work in Progress is valued at lower of cost  and net realisable value. Cost is determined based  on Weighted Average Cost Method.     Service Work in Progress represents closing  inventory of Washed Coal, which is not owned by the  Company as per the terms of Mine Development and  Operation (MDO) contract. Hence, this represents  work performed under contractual liability in bringing  this inventory to its present condition and location.     Net realisable value is the contract price as per the  MDO Agreement, less estimated costs of completion  and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. s)   Overburden Cost Adjustment     Overburden removal expenses incurred during  production stage are charged to revenue based on  waste-to-ore ratio, (commonly known as Stripping  Ratio in the industry). This ratio is taken based on  the current operational phase of overall mining  area.

Financial Instruments and Risk Review a)   Accounting Classification and Fair Value Hierarchy   Financial Assets and Liabilities :     The Company's principal financial assets include investments, derivative assets, trade receivables, cash and  cash equivalents, other bank balances and deposits, interest accrued, security deposits, intercorporate deposits,  contract  assets  and  other  receivables.  The  Company's  principal  financial  liabilities  comprise  of  derivative  liabilities, borrowings, lease liabilities, retention and capital creditors, interest accrued, deposit from customers  and others, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company's  operations and projects.   Fair Value Hierarchy :     The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are  either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:   Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).     Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in  whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.     The following tables summarize carrying amounts of financial instruments by their categories and their levels in  fair value hierarchy for each year end presented.

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 471 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   A.   Commodity Price Risk :       The Company's performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily coal  and also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the Company is  engaged in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close monitoring over its  purchases to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and supply scenario in the  international market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in various countries. To mitigate  price risk, the Company effectively manages availability of coal as well as price volatility through widening  its sourcing base, appropriate combination of long term and short term contracts with its vendors and  customers and well planned procurement and inventory strategy.   B.   Foreign Currency Exchange Risk :                   Since the Company operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in more  than one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency or where  assets or liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency.       The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows  established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward and  option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks.       For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign currency  exposure, please refer note no. 43.       For every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the functional currency  and foreign currency, the Company's profit before tax for the year would increase or decrease as follows: ( `  crore) Particulars For the year ended    March 31, 2025 For the year ended    March 31, 2024 Impact on profit before tax for the year (0.08) 0.26   C.   Interest Risk :       The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash management  activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with variable interest rates.  The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans  and borrowings.        The Company's risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control of Central  Treasury Team of the Adani Group under the framework of Risk Management Policy for interest rate risk.  The Group’s Central Treasury Team ensures appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company  through appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed  in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives.        For Company's floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the liability  outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase  or decrease is used, which represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change  in interest rate.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist  of Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets.  The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.       Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well  as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of counter  parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits. Credit risk  from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the Company's treasury team  in accordance with the Company's risk management policy. Cash and cash equivalents and Bank Deposits  are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record and high quality credit rating.       The concentration of credit risk is very limited due to the fact that the large customers are mainly public sector  units (which are government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk. Remaining customer  base is large and widely dispersed.

The Company's objective is to provide financial resources to meet  its obligations when they are due in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital  structure. The Company monitors liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider  the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.  A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through continued support from trade  creditors, lenders and equity contributions.         The tables below provide details regarding contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities as at the  reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments. 42.

The counter  party for these contracts is generally a bank.       All derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured  at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the  intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. The use of derivative instruments is subject to  limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management. The limits, authorities and  monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by management and the Board. The market risk on derivatives  is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are  used only for risk management purposes.

The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded) and is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act,  1972. Under the Act, every employee who has completed at least five year of service is entitled to gratuity  benefits on departure at 15 days of basic salary (last drawn basic salary) for each completed year of service.  The scheme is funded with contributions to insurers (LIC and SBI) in form of a qualifying insurance policy.     Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment  risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk   Investment Risk: These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and  highly rated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to  the interest rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market  fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. Interest Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount  rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting  period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities  and vice-versa. Longevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the  best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their  employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase  the plan's liability. Salary Risk: The  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  liability  is  calculated  by  reference  to  the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan  participants will increase the plan's liability.     The following tables summarise the component of the net benefits expense recognised in the statement  of profit and loss account and the funded status and amounts recognized in the balance sheet for the  respective plan.   1)   Net amount recognised in the statement of Profit & Loss for the year ( `  crore) Particulars For the Year Ended  March 31, 2025 For the Year Ended  March 31, 2024 Current Service cost 8.77 7.22 Interest cost 3.94 3.50 Expected return on plan assets (2.98) (2.93) Net amount recognised 9.73 7.79  47.

Sensitivity  Analysis:       The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions  occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The results of  sensitivity analysis is given below : ( `  crore) Change in  Assumption Change in  Rate As at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024 Increase in    Assumption Decrease in    Assumption Increase in    Assumption Decrease in  Assumption Discount Rate ( - / + 1 %) (2.73) 2.99  (2.26) 2.48  Salary Growth Rate ( - / + 1 %) 2.93  (2.73) 2.42  (2.25) Attrition Rate ( - / + 50 %) (1.97) 2.68  (1.92) 2.84  Mortality Rate ( - / + 10 %) (0.00) 0.00  (0.00) 0.00        The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined  benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as  some of the assumptions may be correlated. There is no change in method of valuation for the prior period.   5)   Maturity Profile of Obligations       The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting year is 4  years (March 31, 2024: 4 years).

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 481 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   6)    Asset - Liability Matching Strategies       The Company has purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in  which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance  Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year  (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets is funded by the Company.  The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets  is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in interest  rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in a increase in liability without  corresponding increase in the asset).   7)     The Company's expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is  `  30.76 crore (March 31, 2024  :  `  22.27 crore)   8)     The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation, seniority,  promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market.       * As the gratuity fund is managed by life insurance companies, details of fund invested by insurer are not  available with the Company. 48.

During the year ended March 31, 2023, a short seller report (“SSR”) was published making certain allegations  against some of Adani Group companies (including the Company). On 3 rd  January, 2024, the Hon’ble Supreme  Court (“SC”) disposed of all matters in various petitions including those relating to separate independent  investigations relating to the allegation in SSR and stated that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”)  should complete investigation in pending two matters and take its investigations to their logical conclusion in  accordance with law. The management believes that the pending two matters have also been concluded as per  available information.     Pursuant to the SC order, various legal and regulatory proceedings by SEBI, legal opinions obtained, independent  legal and accounting review undertaken by the Adani Group and the fact that there are no other pending  regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings as of date, except relating to show cause notices from the SEBI alleging  non-compliance with provisions of applicable laws and regulations pertaining to related party transactions in  respect of certain transactions with third parties, validity of peer review certificates of statutory auditors with  respect to earlier years and alleging wrongful categorisation of shareholding of certain entities, the management  of the Company concluded that there is no material non-compliance of applicable laws and regulations and  hence there are no material consequences of the allegations against the Company. Accordingly, these financial  statements do not carry any adjustments in this regard. 57.    In November 2024, the Company became aware of an indictment filed by United States Department of Justice  (US DOJ) and a civil complaint by Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) in the United States District  Court for the Eastern District of New York against an executive director of the Company. Since this matter does  not pertain to the Company, there is no impact to this Standalone Financial Statements. 58.    As per Ind AS 108, "Operating Segments", in case a financial report contains both Standalone Financial Statements  and Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, segment information is required to be presented only on  the basis of Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. Hence, the required segment information has  been disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 59.

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 505 To the Members of Adani Enterprises Limited Report on the audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements Qualified Opinion We have audited the accompanying Consolidated   Financial Statements of  Adani Enterprises Limited  (hereinafter referred to as “the Parent Company”), its  subsidiaries (the Parent Company and its subsidiaries  together referred to as “the Group”), its associates and  jointly controlled entities, comprising of the Consolidated  Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Consolidated  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  (including  other  comprehensive income), the Consolidated Statement  of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of  Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a  summary of material accounting policies, notes forming  part  of  financial  statements  and  other  explanatory  information (herein after referred to as “Consolidated  Financial Statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, and based  on the consideration of the reports of other auditors on  separate audited financial statements of the subsidiaries,  jointly controlled entities and associates, referred to in  the Other Matters section below except for the possible  effects of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified  Opinion section of our report, the aforesaid Consolidated  Financial Statements give the information required  by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner  so required and give a true and fair view in conformity  with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under  section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind  AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted  in India, of the Consolidated state of affairs of the  Group as at March 31, 2025, the Consolidated profit and  other comprehensive income, Consolidated changes  in equity and its Consolidated cash flows for the year  ended on that date. Basis for Qualified Opinion Further, as detailed in Note 47(d) and 47(e) of the  Consolidated Financial Statements, in case of one of  the subsidiaries, namely Mumbai International Airport   Limited  (‘MIAL’),  the  legal  proceedings  involving  investigations initiated by the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs  (‘MCA’)  and  chargesheet  filed  by  the  Central  Bureau of Investigation are currently on-going in respect  of matters involving potential conflict of interest and  alleged misuse of funds of MIAL aggregating to  `  845.76  crores related to works contracts that are currently  included in Property, Plant and Equipment at a net book  value of  `  485.45 crores. The auditors of MIAL have  given a qualified opinion in the absence of sufficient  appropriate audit evidence in respect of the above, as  they are unable to comment on the adjustments and  the consequential impact, if any. Similar qualifications  are inserted by the auditors of immediate holding  entities of MIAL. Our audit report for the previous year ended March 31,  2024 was also qualified in respect of this matter. We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing  specified  under  section  143(10)  of  the  Act  (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are  further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the  Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section  of our report. We are independent of the company  in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together  with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our  audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under  the provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under,  and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities  in accordance with these requirements and the Code  of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained along with the consideration of reports of  the other auditors referred to in Other Matters section  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for  our  qualified  audit  opinion  on  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. Emphasis of Matter We draw your attention to Note 47(i) to the Consolidated  Financial Statement, which describes the matter related  to  Short  Seller  Report  (‘SSR’)  published  during  the  financial year ended March 31, 2023. Based on legal  opinions, legal and accounting review and management’s  assessment thereon, the management is of the  view that there is no material consequences of the  allegations mentioned in the SSR and other allegations  on the Company. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of the above   matter. Independent Auditor’s Report 

506 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit  of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a  separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section we have determined the matters  described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 1 Contingencies relating to taxation, litigations and  arbitrations The provisions and contingent liabilities relate to  ongoing litigations, disputes and claims with various  authorities and third parties. These relate to direct tax,  indirect tax, claims and other general legal proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of business. As at the  year ended March 31, 2025, the amounts involved  were significant. The assessment of a provision or a  contingent liability requires significant judgement by  the respective management because of the inherent  complexity in estimating future costs. The amount  recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the  expenditure. The provisions and contingent liabilities  are subject to changes in the outcomes of litigations  and claims and the positions taken by the respective  management. It involves significant judgement and  estimation to determine the likelihood and timing of  the cash outflows and interpretations of the legal  aspects, tax legislations and judgements previously  made by authorities. Component specific considerations Component auditors of New Delhi Television Limited  (“NDTV”) reported key audit matters relating to  ongoing  tax  litigations  and  overseas  investments  involving legal complexities, judgment, and estimation  uncertainty. For MIAL, the key audit matter relates to  litigation over fees, involving an arbitral award under  legal challenge and recognition of related receivables. Given the materiality and uncertainty of the outcome,  the  matter  was  considered  fundamental  to  users’  understanding of the financial statements. Our audit procedures included, among others: Obtaining and evaluating management’s assessment  of ongoing litigations, including discussions with  in-house legal counsel and review of external legal  opinions, where available on the certain material  litigations to establish likelihood of outflow of  economic resources being probable, possible or  remote in respect of the litigations. Reviewing relevant correspondence with regulatory  authorities and legal documents including arbitration  awards, court orders, and notices. Involving  subject  matter  experts  with  specialized  skills and knowledge to assist in the assessment of  the  value  of  significant  provisions  and  contingent  liabilities relating to the pending litigations, on  sample basis, in light of the nature of the exposures,  applicable regulations and related correspondence  with the authorities. Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting  treatments adopted, including recognition of  provisions or disclosures as contingent liabilities in  accordance with Ind AS 37 – Provisions, Contingent  Liabilities and Contingent Assets Assessing and validating the adequacy and  appropriateness of the disclosures made by  the management in the Consolidated Financial  Statements. Assessing  the  component  auditors’  procedures  performed in relation to NDTV and MIAL, and engaging  with them to evaluate the conclusions drawn. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 507 Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 2 Timing of Revenue recognition and adjustments  involving critical estimates Material estimation is involved in recognition and  measurement of its revenue. The value and timing  of revenue recognition for sale of goods varies from  contract to contract, and the activity can span beyond  the year end. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when  control is transferred to the customers and when  there are no other unfulfilled obligations. This requires  detailed analysis of each sale agreement/ contract / customer purchase order regarding timing of revenue  recognition. Inappropriate assessment could lead to a risk of  revenue being recognized on sale of goods before the  control in the goods is transferred to the customer. Subsequent adjustments are made to the transaction  price due to grade mismatch/slippage of the  transferred goods (coal). The variation in the contract  price if not settled mutually between the parties to  the contract is referred to third party testing and the  management estimates the adjustments required  for revenue recognition pending settlement of such  dispute. Such adjustments in revenue are made on  estimated basis following historical trend. Inappropriate estimation could lead to a risk of revenue  being overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, timing  of recognition of revenue and adjustments for coal  quality variances involving critical estimates is a key  audit matter. Component specific considerations Component auditors of AWL Agri Business Limited  (formerly Adani Wilmar Limited) reported a key audit  matter on revenue recognition due to high transaction  volume, varied terms across geographies, involvement  of rebates and discounts, and the risk of revenue  being recognized before transfer of control. Our audit procedures included, among others: Evaluating  the  Group’s  accounting  policies  for  revenue recognition, including policies relating to the  recognition of variable consideration arising from coal  quality variances; Assessing the design and testing the operating  effectiveness of key controls over revenue recognition,  including controls relating to delivery documentation,  customer acceptances, and pricing adjustments. On a sample basis, testing sales transactions near the  year-end to assess whether revenue was recognized  in the correct accounting period based on terms of  delivery and transfer of control. Reviewing sample contracts and delivery  documentation to evaluate the timing of revenue  recognition and compliance with the criteria under  Ind AS 115. Evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  management’s  estimates for coal quality-related adjustments by  comparing historical trends and settlement outcomes  with the current year’s estimates. Assessing the adequacy and completeness of  disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to AWL Agri Business Limited, reviewing  the  component  auditor’s  findings  and  procedures,  and considering their conclusions in evaluating the  audit evidence relevant to the Consolidated Financial  Statements. 

508 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 3 Measurement of inventory quantities As at March 31, 2025 the Parent has coal inventory  of  `  1,616.04 Crores. This was determined a key  audit matter, as the measurement of these inventory  quantities lying at the ports/ yards involves significant  judgement and estimate resulting from measuring the  surface area. The Parent uses internal and external  experts,  to  perform  volumetric  assessments,  basis  which the quantity for these inventories is estimated. Our audit procedures included, among others: Obtaining an understanding and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of controls over physical  count and measurement of such inventory; Evaluating the competency and capabilities of  management’s  experts  for  quantification  of  the  inventories. Physically observing inventory measurement and  count procedures carried out by management  using  experts  on  sample  basis,  spanning  over  the  engagement period, to ensure its appropriateness and  completeness; and Obtaining and inspecting, inventory measurement and  physical count results for such inventories, including  assessing and evaluating the results of analysis  performed by management in respect of differences  between book and physical quantities. Verifying that the physical verification differences, if  any, are appropriately accounted for in the books of  accounts. Information other than Consolidated Financial  Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon The  Parent  Company’s  management  and  Board  of  Directors are responsible for the preparation of the  other information. The other information comprises the  information included in the management discussion  and  analysis,  board’s  report  including  annexures  to  board’s report, business responsibility and sustainability  report, corporate governance, tax transparency report  and shareholder’s information, but does not include the  Consolidated Financial Statement, standalone financial  statements, and our audit reports thereon. Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read  the  other  information,  compare  with  the  financial  statement of the subsidiaries, associates and jointly  controlled entities audited by the other auditors, to  the extent it relates to these entities and, in doing so,  consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements  or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise  appears to be materially misstated. Other information  so far as it relates to the subsidiaries, associates and  jointly  controlled  entities,  is  traced  from  its  financial  statements audited by the other auditors or certified by  the management, as the case may be. If, based on the  work we have performed, we conclude that there is a  material misstatement of this other information; we are  required to report that fact. We have nothing to report  in this regard. Management’s and Board of Director’s  Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial  Statements The  Parent  Company’s  management  and  the  Board  of Directors are responsible for the matters stated  in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the  preparation and presentation of these Consolidated  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the  consolidated  financial  position,  consolidated  financial  performance including other comprehensive income,  consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in  equity of the Group, its associates and jointly controlled  entities in accordance with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India, including the applicable  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under  Section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective management and the Board of  Directors of the companies included in the Group  and its associates and jointly controlled entities are  responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 509 records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding the assets of the Group, its associates  and jointly controlled entities and for preventing and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls,  that  were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of  preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by  the Board of Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the  respective management and the Boards of Directors of  the companies included in the Group its associates and  jointly controlled entities are responsible for assessing  the ability of the respective entities to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related  to going concern and using the going concern basis  of accounting unless respective management either  intends to liquidate or to cease operations, or has no  realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Boards of Directors of the companies  included in the Group, its associates and jointly controlled  entities are also responsible for overseeing the financial  reporting process of the Group its associates and jointly  controlled entities. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a  whole are free from material misstatement, whether due  to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high  level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated  Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: �     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. �     Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for  expressing  our  opinion on whether the Group, its associates and  its jointly controlled entities has adequate internal  financial controls system in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. �     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates and related disclosures made by  management and the Board of Directors. �     Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s  use of the going concern basis of accounting and,  based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  ability of the Group, its associates and its jointly  controlled entities to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated  Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Group its associates and  its jointly controlled entities to cease to continue as  a going concern. �     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  Consolidated Financial Statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. �     Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the financial information of the entities  or business activities within the Group, its  associates and its jointly controlled entities to  express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial  Statements. We are responsible for the direction,  

510 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 supervision and performance of the audit of the  financial statements of such entities included in  the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we  are the independent auditors. For the other entities  included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,  which have been audited by other auditors, such  other auditors remain responsible for the directions,  supervision and performance of the audits carried  out by them. We remain solely responsible for our  audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are  further described in the section titled Other Matters  in this audit report. We communicate with those charged with governance  of the Parent Company and such other entities included  in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we  are the independent auditors regarding, among other  matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit  and significant audit findings, including any significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we  identify  during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements of the current period and are  therefore the key audit matters.

Management’s and Board of Director’s  Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors or management of  the Parent company, subsidiaries, associates and jointly  controlled entities, which are companies incorporated in  India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal  financial  controls  based  on  the  internal  control over financial reporting criteria established by  the respective Companies considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial  Reporting (the ‘Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls  that  were  operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to  respective  company’s  policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and  errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor’s Responsibility Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  internal financial controls over financial reporting of the  Parent Company, based on our audit. We conducted our  audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the  Standards on Auditing, issued by Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India and deemed to be prescribed  under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to  the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls and both issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance  Note require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  was  established  and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls  system  over  financial  reporting  and  their  operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based  on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend  on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated  Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and  the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms  of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls  system over financial reporting of the Parent Company,  its subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities,  which are companies incorporated in India.

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 519 internal  financial  control  and  the  operational  effectiveness of such control, if any, would be  known only after the investigations are concluded.  The component auditors of this subsidiary have  qualified their opinion in this regard. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A  company’s  internal  financial  control  over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  financial  control over financial reporting includes those policies  and procedures that: (1)   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2)   provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of  financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made only in accordance with authorizations of  management and directors of the company; and (3)   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,  or disposition of the company’s assets that could  have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur  and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting  to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial control over financial reporting may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and based on  the consideration of reports of the other auditors, as  referred to in Other Matters paragraph above, the Group,  its associates and jointly controlled entities, which are  companies incorporated in India, have maintained, in all  material respects, an adequate internal financial controls  system  over  financial  reporting  and  such  internal  financial controls over financial reporting were operating  effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal  control over financial reporting criteria established by the  Parent Company considering the essential components  of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of Internal Financial Control over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

528 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 1.   CORPORATE INFORMATION Adani  Enterprises  Limited  (‘the  Company’,  ‘AEL’,‘Parent’) is a listed public company domiciled in  India and incorporated under the provisions of the  Companies Act, 1956, having its registered office at  "Adani Corporate House", Shantigram, Near Vaishno  Devi Circle, S. G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad -  382421, Gujarat, India. Its shares are listed on the  BSE Limited and the National Stock Exchange of  India Limited. AEL along with its subsidiaries ("the  Group"), associates and jointly controlled entities  is a global integrated infrastructure player with  businesses spanning across integrated resources  management, mining services and commercial  mining, new energy ecosystem, data center, airports,  roads, copper, digital space and others. 2.   MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES I.   Basis of Preparation a)   Statement of Compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Group  have been prepared in accordance with Indian  Accounting  Standards  (Ind  AS)  notified  under  Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and other  accounting principles generally accepted in India. These consolidated financial statements have been  prepared under the historical cost convention with  the exception of certain assets and liabilities that  are required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS. The Group's consolidated financial statements are  presented  in  INR  except  when  otherwise  stated.  All amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest  crore, unless otherwise indicated and amounts less  than  `  50,000/- have been presented as "0.00". b)   Principles of Consolidation The  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the  financial  statements  of  the  Company,  its  subsidiaries and equity accounting of its investment  in associates and jointly controlled entities. Control is achieved when the Group has:- -   Power over the investee -     Exposure or rights, to variable returns from its  involvement with the investee and -     The ability to use its power over the investee to  affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority  of voting rights result in control. To support this  presumption and when the Group has less than  a majority of the voting or similar rights of an  investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and  circumstances in assessing whether it has power  over an investee, including: -     Rights arising from other contractual    arrangements -     Potential voting rights held by the Group  and other parties -     The  size  of  the  Group’s  holding  of  voting  rights relative to the size and dispersion of the  holdings of the other voting rights holders. The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls  an investee if facts and circumstances indicate  that there are changes to one or more of the three  elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary  begins when the Group obtains control over the  subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control  of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and  expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed off  during the year are included in the consolidated  financial statements from the date the Group gains  control until the date the Group ceases to control  the subsidiary. Consolidated financial statements are prepared using  uniform accounting policies for like transactions and  other events in similar circumstances. If a member of  the Group uses accounting policies other than those  adopted in the consolidated financial statements,  appropriate adjustments are made to that group  member’s  financial  statements  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements  to  ensure  conformity with the group’s accounting policies. The financial statements of all the entities used  for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to  same reporting date as that of the parent company.  When the end of the reporting period of the parent is  different from that of a subsidiary, jointly controlled  entities or associate, the respective entity prepares,  for  consolidation  purposes,  additional  financial  information as of the same date as the financial  statements of the parent to enable the parent to  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 529 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 consolidate  the  financial  information  of  the  said  entity, unless it is impracticable to do so. The consolidated financial statements have been  prepared on the following basis.   Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are considered for consolidation when  the Group obtains control over the subsidiary  and are derecognised when the Group loses  control of the subsidiary. Subsidiaries have been  consolidated on a line-by-line basis by adding  together the book values of the like items of assets,  liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows.  Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised  gains resulting on intra-group transactions are  eliminated in full. Unrealised losses resulting  from intra-group transactions are eliminated in  arriving at the carrying amount of assets unless  transaction provides an evidence of impairment of  transferred asset. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of  profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group  and are presented separately in the Statement of  Profit and Loss and Consolidated Balance Sheet,  separately  from  parent  shareholders’  equity,  profit  and  loss  and  each  component  of  other  comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the  equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the  non-controlling interests, even if this results in the  non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Changes  in  the  Group’s  ownership  interests  in  subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing  control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as  equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the  Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests  are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative  interests in the subsidiaries.     Associates and Jointly Controlled Entities - Equity  Accounting An associate is an entity over which the Group has  significant  influence.  Significant  influence  is  the  power to participate in the financial and operating  policy decisions of the investee but is not control or  joint control over those policies. A jointly controlled entity is a joint arrangement  whereby the parties that have joint control of the  arrangement have rights to the net assets of the  joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually  agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which  exists  only  when  decisions  about  the  relevant  activities require unanimous consent of the parties  sharing control. The results and assets and liabilities of associates  and jointly controlled entities are incorporated in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  using  the  equity method of accounting. Under the equity  method, an investment in an associate or a jointly  controlled entity is initially recognised at cost and  adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share  of post acquisition profits or losses and that of other  comprehensive income of the associate or jointly  controlled entity. Distributions received from an  associate or a jointly controlled entity reduce the  carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised gains  and losses resulting from transactions between  the Group, Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate  entities are eliminated to the extent of the interest in  the Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate entities. If  an  entity’s  share  of  losses  of  an  associate  or  joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the  associate or joint venture (which includes any  long term interest that, in substance, form part  of the Group’s net investment in the associate or  joint venture), the entity discontinues recognising  its share of further losses. Additional losses are  recognised only to the extent that the Group has  incurred legal or constructive obligations or made  payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.  If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports  profits,  the  entity  resumes  recognising  its  share  of those profits only after its share of the profits  equals the share of losses not recognised. After application of the equity method, at each  reporting date, the Group determines whether there  is objective evidence that the investment in the  associate or jointly controlled entity is impaired.  If there exists such evidence, the Group determines  extent of impairment and then recognises the loss  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate  or joint control over the jointly controlled entity,  the Group measures and recognises any retained  investment at its fair value. Any difference between  the carrying amount of the associate or the jointly  

530 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 controlled entity and the fair value of the retained  investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised  in profit and loss.   Unincorporated Entities In case of unincorporated entities in the nature  of a Joint Operation, the Group recognizes its  direct right and its share of jointly held or incurred  assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues  and expenses of joint operations. These have been  incorporated in these financial statements under  the appropriate headings.

Refer note 39(a) c)     Significant  accounting  judgements,  accounting  estimates and assumptions The preparation of Group's Consolidated financial  statements requires management to make certain  judgements, estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses,  assets and liabilities (including contingent  liabilities) and the accompanying disclosures.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed  on an ongoing basis.   Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  years, are described below. Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments may  change due to market changes or circumstances  arising that are beyond the control of the Group.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur.     Material estimates and assumptions are required in  particular for:   i)     Useful life of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets:     This involves determination of the estimated  useful life of property, plant and equipment  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 543 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and intangible assets and the assessment  as to which components of the cost may be  capitalised. Useful life of these assets is based  on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical  estimates, taking into account the nature of  the asset, estimated usage, expected residual  values, anticipated technological changes,  maintenance support and operating conditions  of the asset. Management reviews its estimate  of the useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable  assets at each reporting date, based on the  expected utility of the assets.   ii)   Impairment of Non Financial Asset :     Impairment  exists  when  the  carrying  value  of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds  its recoverable amount, which is the higher  of its fair value less costs of disposal and  its value in use. The fair value less costs of  disposal calculation is based on available data  for similar assets or observable market prices  less incremental costs for disposing of the  asset. The value in use calculation is based  on a discounted future cashflows model.  The recoverable amount is sensitive to the  discount rate used for the discounted future  cashflows model as well as the expected future  cash-inflows and the growth rate used.   iii)   Taxes:     Significant  judgements  are  involved  in  estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of  paying advance tax, determining the provision  for income taxes, including amount expected to  be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.  Significant  management  judgement  is  also  required to determine the amount of deferred  tax assets that can be recognised, based upon  the likely timing and the level of future taxable  profits  together  with  future  tax  planning  strategies, including estimates of temporary  differences reversing on account of available  benefits  from  the  tax  laws  applicable  to  respective entities.   iv)   Fair value measurement of financial instruments:     In estimating the fair value of financial assets  and financial liabilities, the Group uses market  observable  data  to  the  extent  available.  Where such Level 1 inputs are not available,  the Group establishes appropriate valuation  techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not  feasible, a degree of judgment is required in  establishing fair values. Judgments include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in  assumptions about these factors could affect  the reported fair value of financial instruments.   v)   Defined benefit plans:     The cost of the defined benefit plan and the  present value of the obligation are determined  using actuarial valuations. An actuarial  valuation involves making various assumptions  that may differ from actual developments in  the future. These include the determination  of the discount rate, future salary increases,  attrition rate and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities involved in the valuation and its  long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation  is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at  each reporting date.   vi)   Inventory Measurement     Measurement of bulk inventory lying at  ports/ yards is material, complex and involves  significant judgement and estimate resulting  from measuring the surface area. The Group  performs physical counts of above inventory  on  a  periodic  basis  using  internal  /  external  experts  to  perform  volumetric  surveys  and  assessments, basis which the estimate of  quantity for these inventories is determined.  The variations noted between book records and  physical quantities of above inventories are  evaluated and appropriately accounted in the  books of accounts.   vii)     Determination of lease term & discount rate :     Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine  the lease term as the non-cancellable period  of a lease adjusted with any option to extend  or terminate the lease, if the use of such  option is reasonably certain. The Group makes  

544 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 assessment  on  the  expected  lease  term  on  lease by lease basis and thereby assesses  whether it is reasonably certain that any  options to extend or terminate the contract will  be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the  Group considers factors such as any significant  leasehold improvements undertaken over the  lease term, costs relating to the termination  of lease and the importance of the underlying  to the Group’s operations taking into account  the location of the underlying asset and  the availability of the suitable alternatives.  The lease term in future periods is reassessed  to ensure that the lease term reflects the  current economic circumstances.     The discount rate is generally based on the  incremental  borrowing  rate  specific  to  the  lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases  with similar characteristics.   viii)   Asset Retirement Obligation :     The liability for asset retirement obligations  are recognised when the Group has an  obligation to perform site restoration activity.  The recognition and measurement of asset  retirement obligations involves the use of  estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of  abandonment of site facilities which would  depend upon the ultimate life of the project,  expected utilization of assets in other projects,  the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax  rate applied for discounting.   ix)     Recognition and measurement of Contingent  liabilities, provisions and uncertain tax positions:     There are various legal, direct and indirect tax  matters and other obligations including local  and state levies, availing input tax credits etc.,  which may impact the Group. Evaluation of  uncertain liabilities and contingent liabilities  arising out of above matters and recognition  and measurement of other provisions are based  on the assessment of the probability of an  outflow of resources, and on past experience  and circumstances known at the balance sheet  date. The actual outflow of resources at a  future date may therefore vary from the figure  included in other provisions. d)   Current & Non-Current Classification Any asset or liability is classified as current if it  satisfies any of the following conditions : i)     The asset/liability is expected to be realised/ settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle; ii)   The asset is intended for sale or consumption; iii)     The asset/liability is held primarily for the  purpose of trading; iv)     The asset/liability is expected to be realised/ settled within twelve months after the  reporting period; v)     The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it  is restricted from being exchanged or used to  settle a liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date; vi)     In the case of a liability, the Group does not  have an unconditional right to defer settlement  of the liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date. All  other  assets  and  liabilities  are  classified  as  non-current.  Deferred  tax  assets  &  liabilities  are  classified  as  non-current  assets  &  liabilities respectively. For the purpose of current/non-current classification  of assets and liabilities, the Group has ascertained  its normal operating cycle as twelve months.  This is based on the nature of services and the time  between the acquisition of assets or inventories  for processing and their realisation in cash and  cash equivalents. II   Summary of Material Accounting Policies a)   Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations   i)   Functional and Presentation Currency     The  Consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is the  functional and presentation currency of the  parent company.   ii)   Transactions and Balances     Foreign currency transactions are translated  into the functional currency, for initial  recognition, using the exchange rates at the  dates of the transactions. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 545 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     All foreign currency denominated monetary  assets and liabilities are translated at the  exchang e rates on the reporting date.  Exchange differences arising on settlement or  translation of monetary items are recognised  in statement of profit and loss except to the  extent  of  exchange  differences  which  are  regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on  foreign currency borrowings that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or construction  of qualifying assets which are capitalised  as  cost  of  assets.  Additionally,  all  exchange  gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings  taken prior to April 1, 2016 which are related  to the acquisition or construction of qualifying  assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such  assets. Non-monetary items that are measured  in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency  are not retranslated.   iii)    Group Companies     On consolidation, the assets and liabilities  of foreign operations are translated at the  exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date  and  their  statements  of  profit  and  loss  are  translated  using  average  rate  of  exchange  prevailing during the year, which approximates to  the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction  date. All resulting exchange differences arising  on translation for consolidation are recognised  in OCI. On disposal of a foreign operation, the  component of OCI relating to that particular  foreign operation is reclassified / recognised in  the statement of profit and loss. b)     Non Current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued  Operations The  Group  classifies  Non  Current  assets  (or  disposal group) and operations as held for sale or  as discontinued operations if their carrying amounts  will be recovered principally through a sale rather  than  through  continuing  use.  Classification  as  a discontinued operations occurs upon disposal  or when the operation meets the below criteria  whichever earlier. Non Current Assets are classified as held for sale  only when both the conditions are s atisfied – 1.     The sale is highly probable, and 2.     The asset or disposal group is available for  immediate sale in its present condition subject  only to terms that are usual and customary for  sale of such assets.     Non-current assets which are subject to  depreciation are not depreciated or amortized  once those classified as held for sale.     A discontinued operation is a component of the  Group's business, the operations of which can  be clearly distinguished from those of the rest  of the Group and   i)     is part of a single co-ordinated plan to  dispose of a separate major line of business  or geographical area of operations; or   ii)      is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a  view to resale.     Non-current assets and disposal groups  classified as held for sale are measured at the  lower of their carrying amount and the fair  value less costs to sell. Assets and associated  liabilities classified as held for sale are presented  separately in the balance sheet. The results of  discontinued operations are excluded from the  overall results of the Group and are presented  separately as a single amount in the statement  of  profit  and  loss.  Also,  the  comparative  statement of profit and loss is re-presented as  if the operations had been discontinued from  the start of the comparative period. c)   Cash & Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit  with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term  balances (with an original maturity of three months  or less from the date of acquisition), which are  subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. d)   Property, Plant and Equipment   Recognition and Measurement Property, Plant and Equipment, including Capital  Work in Progress, are stated at cost of acquisition  or construction less accumulated depreciation and  impairment losses, if any. Borrowing cost relating  to acquisition / construction of Property, Plant and  Equipment which takes substantial period of time  

546 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 to get ready for its intended use are also included to  the extent they relate to the period till such assets  are ready to be put to use. The  present  value  of  the  expected  cost  for  the  decommissioning of an asset after its use is included  in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition  criteria for a provision are met. If significant parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, then they are  accounted for as separate items (major components)  of property, plant and equipment. The Group has elected to regard previous GAAP  carrying values of property, plant and equipment  as deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e April 1, 2015.   Subsequent Measurement Subsequent  expenditure  related  to  an  item  of  Property, Plant and Equipment are included in its  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,  as appropriate, only when it is probable that the  future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Group and the cost of the item  can be measured reliably. Subsequent costs are  depreciated over the residual life of the respective  assets.  All  other  expenses  on  existing  Property,  Plant and equipment, including day-to-day  repair  and  maintenance  expenditure  and  cost  of  replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of  Profit and Loss for the period during which such  expenses are incurred.   Capital Work in Progress Expenditure  related  to  and  incurred  during  implementation of capital projects to get the assets  ready for intended use is included under “Capital  Work in Progress”. The same is allocated to the  respective items of property plant and equipment on  completion of construction/ erection of the capital  project/ property plant and equipment. The cost of  asset not ready for its intended use before the year  end & capital inventory are disclosed under Capital  work in progress.   Depreciation Depreciation is provided using straight-line method  as  specified  in  Schedule  II  to  the  Companies  Act, 2013 or based on technical estimates.  Depreciation on assets added / disposed off during  the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference  to the date of addition / disposal. Except  incase  of  some  overseas  entities  where  schedule II is not applicable, useful life is considered  based on management estimates or as per the  prevailing laws in those countries.   Oil & Gas assets : Expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the right(s)  to  explore,  develop  and  produce  oil  and  gas  are  expensed off in the year of incurrence to the extent  of the efforts not successful. Expenditure incurred on  the acquisition of the license are initially capitalised  on a license by license basis. Costs including  indirect cost incurred for the block are held,  undepleted within "Capital Work in Progress" until  the exploration phase relating to the license area is  complete or commercial oil and gas reserves have  been discovered. Indirect costs are expensed off in  the year of incurrence. Exploratory/appraisal  drilling  costs  are  initially  capitalised within "Capital Work in Progress" on a  block by block basis until the success or otherwise  of the block is established. The success or failure  of  each  exploration/appraisal  effort  is  judged  on a block basis. Where  results  of  seismic  studies  or  exploration  drilling indicate the presence of oil and gas reserves  which are ultimately not considered commercially  recoverable and no additional exploratory activity  is firmly planned, all related costs are written off  to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year of  cessation of the exploration activity. Any  payment  made  towards  fulfilment  of  commitment under the contracts from earlier  periods continues to be included under Exploration  and Evaluation Assets at its carried value in  accordance with Ind AS 101.   Exploration and Evaluation assets : Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises  cost that are directly attributable to : -      Cost  of  acquiring  mining  and  exploration    tenements; -      Research and analysing historical exploration    data; 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 547 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 -     Conducting topographical, geochemical and  geophysical studies; -     Conducting  exploratory  drilling,  trenching    and sampling; -     Examining and testing extraction and treatment  methods; and/or -   Compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search  for mineral deposits with economic potential.  Evaluation  expenditure  arises  from  detailed  assessment of deposits or other projects that have  been identified as having economic potential. Exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged  to Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred unless  the directors are confident of the project's technical  and commercial feasibility and it is probable that  economic benefits will flow to the Group, in which  case expenditure may be capitalised. Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure  is treated as a tangible asset and is recorded at  cost less any accumulated impairment charges.  No amortisation is charged during the exploration  and evaluation phase as the assets is not  available for use.   Derecognition An item of property, plant and equipment is  derecognised upon disposal or when no future  economic  benefits  are  expected  to  arise  from  continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising  on the disposal or retirement of property, plant and  equipment is determined as the difference between  the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of  the assets and is recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss. e)   Investment Properties i)     Assets which are held for long-term rental  yields or for capital appreciation or both,  are  classified  as  Investment  Properties.  Investment properties are measured initially at  cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to  initial recognition, investment properties are  stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment loss, if any.     The Group has elected to regard previous GAAP  carrying values of investment properties as  deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e April 1, 2015. ii)     The Group depreciates investment properties  over their estimated useful lives as specified in  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. iii)    Investment properties are derecognised /  transferred when they have been disposed off,  have been used for own purpose of the Company  or when they have permanently withdrawn from  use and no future economic benefit is expected  from their disposal. The difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount  of the asset is recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss in the period in which the property  is derecognised. f)   Intangible Assets i)     Intangible assets are measured on initial  recognition at cost and are subsequently carried  at cost less any accumulated amortisation  and accumulated impairment losses, if any.  Internally generated intangibles other than  software and applications are not capitalised.  In case of softwares and applications,  production costs associated with development  of original content are capitalised.     Mine  Development  Assets  include  expenses  pertaining to land and mine development,  initial overburden removal, environmental and  other regulatory approvals etc. It represents  expenses  incurred  towards  development  of  mines where the Company is operating as  operator and developer.     The Group has intangible assets in the nature  of right to collect toll charges which are  capitalised as intangible asset on the appointed  date and having useful life over the period in  terms of concession agreement.     The Group has intangible assets in the nature  of airport operation rights having useful life  over period of operation agreement which are  capitalised as intangible asset on the appointed  date in terms of concession agreement.     The Group has elected to regard previous  GAAP carrying values of intangible asset as  

548 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e April 1, 2015. ii)     The  intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  are  amortised over the useful economic life and  assessed for impairment whenever there is  an indication that the intangible asset may  be impaired. The Group reviews amortisation  period on an annual basis.     Intangible assets are amortised on straight line  basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Intangible Assets Estimated Useful    Life (Years) Software  applications 3-5 Years based on  management estimate Mine Development  Assets Over a period of  underlying contract Right to collect toll  charges 20 years based on  concession agreement Airport operation  rights Over a period of  operation agreement iii)     Expenditure  incurred  during  development  of  intangible assets is included under “Intangible  Assets under Development”. The same is  allocated to the respective items of intangible  assets on completion of the project. iv)     Gains or losses arising from derecognition  of an intangible asset are measured as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset and are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  when the asset is derecognised. g)   Impairment of Non-Financial Assets i)     At the end of each reporting period, the  Group reviews the carrying amounts of its  tangible and intangible assets to determine  whether there is any indication that those  assets have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such indication exists, the recoverable  amount of the asset is estimated in order to  determine the extent of the impairment loss  (if any). When it is not possible to estimate  the recoverable amount of an individual asset,  the Group estimates the recoverable amount  of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which  the asset belongs. Each CGU represents the  smallest group of assets that generates cash  inflows that are largely independent of the  cash in flows of other assets or CGUs. When a  reasonable and consistent basis of allocation  can  be  identified,  corporate  assets  are  also  allocated to individual cash-generating units,  or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest  group of cash-generating units for which a  reasonable and consistent allocation basis  can be identified. ii)     Recoverable amount is the higher of fair  value less costs of disposal and value in use.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future  cash flows are discounted to their present  value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessments of the time value  of money and the risks specific to the asset for  which the estimates of future cash flows have  not been adjusted. iii)     If the recoverable amount of an asset (or  cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced  to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss  is recognised immediately in the Statement of  Consolidated Profit or Loss. iv)    Assets (other than goodwill) for which  impairment loss has been recognised in prior  periods, the Group reviews at each reporting  date whether there is any indication that  the  loss  has  decreased  or  no  longer  exists.  When an impairment loss subsequently  reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or  a cash-generating unit) is increased to the  revised estimate of its recoverable amount,  so that the increased carrying amount does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have been determined had no impairment loss  been recognised. A reversal of an impairment  loss is recognised immediately in Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss. v)     Impairment is determined for goodwill by  assessing the recoverable amount of CGU  to which such goodwill relates. When the  recoverable amount of the CGU is less than  its carrying amount, an impairment loss is  recognised. Impairment losses relating to  goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 549 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 h)   Service Concession Arrangements Service Concession Arrangements (SCA) refers to an  arrangement between the grantor (a public sector  entity) and the operator (a private sector entity) to  provide services that give the public access to major  economic and social facilities utilising private sector  funds and expertise. With respect to SCA, revenue and costs are allocated  between those relating to construction services and  those relating to operation and maintenance services,  and accounted for separately. The infrastructure  used in a concession are classified as an intangible  asset or a financial asset, depending on the nature  of the payment entitlements under the SCA.  When the Company has an unconditional right to  receive cash or another financial asset from or at  the direction of the grantor, such right is recognised  as a financial asset and is subsequently measured  at amortised cost. When the demand risk is with the  Group and it has right to charge the user for use  of facility, the right is recognised as an intangible  asset and is subsequently measured at cost less  accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.  The intangible assets are amortised over a period of  service concession arrangements. i)   Government Grants Government grants are recognised at their fair value  where there is reasonable assurance that the grant  will be received and all attached conditions will  be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is  deferred and recognised as income in the Statement  of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the  periods necessary to match the related costs, which  they are intended to compensate. When the grant relates to an asset or a non-monetary  item, it is recognised as deferred income under  liabilities and is recognised as income in the  Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis  over the expected useful life of the related asset or  a non-monetary item. j)   Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives  rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial  liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables  which are measured at transaction price. The  Group’s  financial  assets  comprise  of  trade  receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank  balances and deposits, interest accrued, security  deposits, intercorporate deposits, contract assets  and other receivables. These assets are measured  subsequently at amortised cost. The  Group's  financial  liabilities  comprise  of  borrowings, lease liabilities, retention and capital  creditors, Interest accrued, deposit from customers,  contract liabilities, trade and other payables. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset  when the Group has a legally enforceable right  (not contingent on future events) to off-set the  recognised amounts either to settle on a net basis,  or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities  simultaneously. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments  issued by a Group entity are recognised at the  proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.   A)   Financial Assets    Initial  Recognition     All financial assets, except trade receivables,  are initially recognised at fair value.    Subsequent  measurement     Business Model Assessment     The Group makes an assessment of the  objectives of the business model in which a  financial asset is held because it best reflects  the way business is managed and information  is provided to management. The assessment  of business model comprises the stated  policies and objectives of the financial assets,  management strategy for holding the financial  assets, the risk that affects the performance  etc. Further management also evaluates  whether the contractual cash flows are solely  payment of principal and interest considering  the contractual terms of the instrument. 

550 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 The subsequent measurement of financial assets  depends on their classification, as described below:   1)   At amortised cost     A financial asset is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met :   (a)     The asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for  collecting contractual cash flows, and   (b)     Contractual terms of the asset give rise, on  specified dates, to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.     After initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised  cost using the effective interest rate (EIR)  method. The EIR amortisation is included in  finance income in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. The losses arising from impairment are  recognised in the profit or loss. This category  generally applies to trade and other receivables.     The effective interest rate is the rate that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts (including all fees and transaction costs  and other premiums or discounts) through the  expected life of the financial assets, or where  appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross  carrying amount on initial recognition.   2)     At fair value through other comprehensive  income (FVTOCI)     A financial asset is classified as at the FVTOCI if  both of the following criteria are met:   (a)    The objective of the business model  is achieved both by collecting  contractual cash flows and selling the  financial assets, and   (b)     Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.     Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI  category are measured initially as well as at   each reporting date at fair value.  Fair value movements are recognised in  the other comprehensive income (OCI) and  on derecognition, cumulative gain or loss  previously  recognised  in  OCI  is  reclassified  to  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss.  For  equity  instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable  election to present subsequent changes in  the fair value in OCI. If the Group decides to  classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI,  then all fair value changes on the instrument,  excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI.  There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI  to the Statement of Profit and Loss, even on  sale of investment.   3)   At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)     Financial assets which are not measured at  amortised cost or FVTOCI and are held for  trading are measured at FVTPL.     In addition, the Group may elect to designate  a debt instrument, which otherwise meets  amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.  However, such election is allowed only if doing  so reduces or eliminates a measurement or  recognition inconsistency (referred to as  ‘accounting mismatch’).    Equity  investments     All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109  are measured at fair value. The Group may  make an irrevocable election to present in other  comprehensive income subsequent changes  in the fair value. The Group makes such  election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.  The classification is made on initial recognition  and is irrevocable.     If the Group decides to classify an equity  instrument as FVTOCI, then all fair value  changes  on  the  instrument,  excluding  dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no  recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and  loss, even on sale of investment. However, the  Group may transfer the cumulative gain or  loss within equity.     Equity instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognised in the profit and loss.    Derecognition     On  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset,  the  difference between the asset’s carrying amount  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 551 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and the sum of the consideration received and  receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that  had been recognised in other comprehensive  income and accumulated in equity is recognised  in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have  otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on  disposal of that financial asset.     Impairment of Financial Assets     The Group applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL)  model for measurement and recognition of  impairment  loss  on  the  financial  assets  and  credit  risk  exposure.  The  Group  assesses  on  a  forward  looking  basis  the  expected  credit  losses associated with its receivables based on  historical trends and past experience.     The  Group  follows  'Simplified  Approach’  for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on all  trade receivables or contractual receivables.     ECL is the difference between all contracted  cash flows that are due to the Group in  accordance with the contract and all the  cash flows that the Group expects to receive,  discounted at the original EIR. ECL impairment  loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during  the period is recognised as income / (expense)  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   B)   Financial Liabilities     Financial  liabilities  are  classified,  at  initial  recognition as at amortised cost or fair value  through  profit  or  loss.  The  measurement  of  financial  liabilities  depends  on  their  classification, as described below:     1)   At amortised cost       This is the category most relevant to the  Group. After initial recognition, financial  liabilities are subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the EIR method.  Gains and losses are recognised in  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  when  the  liabilities are derecognised as well as  through the EIR amortisation process.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking  into account any discount or premium  on acquisition and fees or costs that  are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR  amortisation is included as finance costs  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.       The effective interest method is a method  of calculating the amortised cost of  a  financial  liability  and  of  allocating  interest expense over the relevant period.  The effective interest rate is the rate that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  payments (including all fees and points  paid or received that form an integral part  of the effective interest rate, transaction  costs and other premiums or discounts)  through the expected life of the financial  liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter  period, to the net carrying amount on  initial recognition.     2)   At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)         Financial liabilities at fair value through  profit  or  loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for  trading  and  financial  liabilities  designated upon initial recognition as  such. Subsequently, any changes in fair  value are recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.     Derecognition of Financial Liability     A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged  or  cancelled  or  expires.  An  exchange  with a lender of debt instruments with  substantially different terms is accounted for  as an extinguishment of the original financial  liability and the recognition of a new financial  liability.  Similarly,  a  substantial  modification  of the terms of an existing financial liability  is accounted for as an extinguishment of the  original financial liability and the recognition of  a new financial liability.   C)   Derivative financial instruments     Initial recognition and subsequent measurement     The Group uses derivative financial instruments  such as forward, options currency contracts and  currency swaps to hedge its foreign currency  risks.  Such  derivative  financial  instruments  are initially recognised and subsequently  measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried  as  financial  assets  when  the  fair  value  is  positive and as financial liabilities when the fair  value is negative. 

552 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Any gains or losses arising from changes in the  fair  value  of  derivative  financial  instrument  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/ (loss). Changes in fair value and gains/(losses)  on settlement of foreign currency derivative  financial  instruments  relating  to  borrowings,  which have not been designated as hedge  are  recorded  as  finance  expense  and  those  pertaining to the effective portion of cash  flow hedges is recognised in OCI and later  reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge  item affects profit or loss or treated as basis  adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction  subsequently results in the recognition of a  non-financial asset or non-financial liability. k)   Hedge Accounting Few Subsidiaries of the Group designates certain  hedging instruments, which include derivatives  in respect of foreign currency risk, as cash  flow hedges. To qualify for hedge accounting,  the hedging relationship must meet all of the  following requirements: -     there is an economic relationship between the  hedged items and the hedging instruments, -     the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is  the same as that resulting from the quantity of  the hedged item that the entity actually hedges  and the quantity of the hedging instrument  that the entity actually uses to hedge that  quantity of hedged item. -     the effect of credit risk does not dominate  the value changes that result from that  economic relationship. At the inception of  the hedge relationship, the entity documents  the relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item, along with its risk  management objectives and its strategy for  undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on  an ongoing basis, it is documented whether the  hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting  changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged  item attributable to the hedged risk.   Cash flow hedges Above companies designate derivative contracts or  non derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging  instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in  interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign  exchange exposure on highly probable future cash  flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability  or forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow  hedging instrument, the effective portion of  changes in the fair value of the derivative / hedging  instruments is recognized in the cash flow hedging  reserve being part of other comprehensive income.  The effective portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted  to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the  hedging instrument and the cumulative change in  fair value of the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value  of the derivative is recognized immediately in  the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging  relationship no longer meets the criteria for  hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is  discontinued prospectively. If  the  hedging  instrument  expires  or  is  sold,  terminated  or  exercised,  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash  flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was  effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until  the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative  gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow  hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  upon  the  occurrence  of  the  underlying transaction. For cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in  OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as reclassification  adjustment in the same period or periods during  which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. l)   Income Taxes Income tax expense comprises current tax expense  and the net change in the deferred tax asset or  liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes  are  recognised  in  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in  which  case,  the  current  and  deferred  tax  are  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 553 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 also recognised in other comprehensive income or  directly in equity, respectively.   i)   Current Income Tax     Provision for current tax is measured at the  amount of tax expected to be payable on the  taxable income for the year as determined in  accordance with the provisions of the tax laws  of the concerned jurisdiction. Current income  tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  amount expected to be recovered from or paid  to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and  tax laws used to compute the amount are those  that are enacted or substantially enacted, at the  reporting date for each concerned jurisdiction.     Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  is  recognised outside the statement of profit and  loss (either in other comprehensive income  (OCI) or in equity). The Group periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  the  tax  returns  with respect to situations in which applicable  tax  regulations  are  subject  to  interpretation  and establishes provisions where appropriate.     Current  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  where the Group has a legally enforceable right  to offset and intends either to settle on a net  basis, or to realise the asset and settle the  liability simultaneously.   ii)   Deferred Tax     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for  deductible  and  taxable  temporary  differences  arising  between  the  tax  base  of  assets and liabilities and their carrying amount,  except when the deferred tax arises from the  initial recognition of an asset or liability in a  transaction that is not a business combination  and  affects  neither  accounting  nor  taxable  profit or loss at the time of the transaction.     Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  to  the  extent that it is probable that taxable profit  will be available against which the deductible  temporary differences, and the carry forward  of unused tax credits and unused tax losses  can be utilised.     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  year when the asset is realised or the liability is  settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted at  the reporting date.     Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. The Group  recognises tax credits in the nature of MAT  credit as an asset only to the extent that there  is convincing evidence that the Group will pay  normal income tax during the specified period,  i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed  to be carried forward. In the year in which the  Group recognises tax credits as an asset, the  said asset is created by way of tax credit to  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.  The Group reviews such tax credit asset at each  reporting date to assess its recoverability. m)   Inventories i)     Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net  realisable value. ii)     Cost of inventories have been computed to  include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion,  all non refundable duties & taxes and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition. iii)    The basis of determining cost for various  categories of inventories are as follows:   Raw Material    :   Weighted Average Cost   Traded Goods    :    Weighted Average Cost   Stores and Spares   :    Weighted Average Cost   Work-in-progress   :    Weighted Average Cost   Finished Goods   :    Weighted Average Cost     For certain categories of traded goods it is  determined based on weighted average cost of  respective commodity lot basis. iv)     Net realisable value is the estimated selling  price in the ordinary course of business,  less estimated cost of completion and  estimated cost necessary to make the sale.  Necessary  adjustment  for  shortage  /  excess  stock is given based on the available evidence  and past experience of the Group. v)     The Inventories are measured at Fair Value  only in those cases where the Inventories are  designated into a fair value hedge relationship. 

554 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 n)     Provision,  Contingent  Liabilities  and  Contingent  Assets Provisions are recognised for when the Group has at  present, legal or contractual obligation as a result  of past events, only if it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic outgo or loss  will be required and if the amount involved can be  measured reliably. If the effect of the time value of  money is material, provisions are discounted using a  current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate,  the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is  used, the increase in the provision due to the passage  of time is recognised as a finance cost. The Group  recognises provision for asset retirement obligation  in accordance with the mining services contract. Contingent liabilities being a possible obligation as a  result of past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence  of one or more future events not wholly in control  of the Group are not recognised in the accounts.  The nature of such liabilities and an estimate of  its financial effect are disclosed in notes to the  financial statements. Contingent assets are not recognised in the  financial statements. the nature of such assets and  an estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in  notes to the financial statements. o)   Revenue recognition Revenue from contract with customer is recognised  upon transfer of control of promised products or  services to customers on complete satisfaction of  performance obligations for an amount that reflects  the  consideration  which  the  Group  expects  to  receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is measured based on the transaction price,  which is the consideration, adjusted for discounts  and other incentives, if any, as per contracts with the  customers. Revenue also excludes taxes collected  from customers in its capacity as agent. The  specific  recognition  criteria  described  below  must also be met before revenue is recognised.   i)   Sale of Goods     Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised  when the control of the goods has been passed  to the customer as per the terms of agreement  and there is no continuing effective control or  managerial involvement with the goods.   ii)   Rendering of Services     Revenue from handling services, mining  services and other services are recognized in  the period in which the services are transferred  to the customer at an amount that reflects the  consideration to which the Group expects to be  entitled in exchange for those services.     Revenue from services rendered is recognised  when the work is performed as per the  performance  obligations  specified  in  the  customer agreements.   iii)   Service Concession Arrangements     Revenue related to construction services  provided under service concession arrangement  is recognised based on the stage of completion  of the work performed. Operation and  maintenance services revenue with respect to  intangible assets is recognised in the period in  which the services are provided by the Group.  Finance income is recognised using effective  interest rate method for financial assets.   iv)   Dividends     Revenue  is  recognised  when  the  Group’s  right to receive the payment is established,  which is generally when shareholders  approve the dividend.   v)   Interest Income     Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by  reference to the principal outstanding and at  the effective interest rate applicable, which  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts  through  the  expected  life of the financial asset to that asset's net  carrying amount on initial recognition.    Contract  Assets     A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Group performs by  transferring goods or services to a customer  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 555 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that is  conditional. The same is disclosed under Other  Current Financial Assets.    Trade  Receivable     A receivable represents the Group's right to an  amount of consideration that is unconditional  i.e. only the passage of time is required before  payment of consideration is due.     Contract Liability     A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which  the Group has received consideration (or an  amount of consideration is due) from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as  revenue when the Group performs under the  contract The same is disclosed as under Other  Current Liabilities. p)   Employee Benefits Employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated  absences, contribution to provident fund, employees'  state insurance and superannuation fund.   i)   Short Term Employee Benefits     Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve  months of rendering the services are classified  as short term employee benefits and recognised  in the period in which the employee renders  the related service. These are recognised at the  undiscounted amount of the benefits expected  to be paid in exchange for that service.   ii)   Share-based payment transactions     The grant date fair value of equity settled  share-based payment awards granted to  employees is recognised as an employee  benefits  expense,  with  a  corresponding  increase in equity, over the period that the  employees unconditionally become entitled to  the awards. The amount recognised as expense  is based on the estimate of the number of  awards for which the related service conditions  are expected to be met, such that the amount  ultimately recognised as an expense is based on  the number of awards that do meet the related  service and non-market vesting conditions at  the vesting date.     In case of forfeiture/lapse/surrender stock  option, which is not vested, amortised  portion is reversed by credit to employee  compensation  expense.  In  a  situation  where  the  stock  option  expires  unexercised,  the  related balance standing to the credit of the  Share based payment reserve, is transferred  within other equity.   iii)   Post Employment Benefits     Defined Contribution Plans     Retirement benefits in the form of provident  fund  and  superannuation  fund  are  defined  contribution schemes. The Group has no  obligation, other than the contribution  payable to these funds. The Group recognises  contribution payable to these funds as an  expense,  when  an  employee  renders  the  related service. If the contribution payable to  the scheme for service received before the  balance sheet date exceeds the contribution  already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme  is recognised as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid.     Defined Benefit Plans     The Group operates a defined benefit gratuity  plan.  The  cost  of  providing  benefits  under  the defined benefit plan is determined based  on actuarial valuation, carried out by an  independent actuary, using the projected  unit credit method. The liability for gratuity is  funded annually to a gratuity funds maintained  with  the  Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  India  and SBI Life Insurance Company Limited.     Re-measurements gains and losses arising  from  experience  adjustments,  changes  in  actuarial assumptions and the return on plan  assets (excluding net interest) are recognised  immediately in the balance sheet with a  corresponding debit or credit to retained  earnings through other comprehensive  income in the period in which they occur.  

556 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Re-measurements  are  not  reclassified  to  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  in  subsequent  periods. Net interest is calculated by applying  the discount rate to the net balance of defined  benefit liability or asset.     The Group recognises the following changes  in  the  net  defined  benefit  obligation  as  an  expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss in  the line item "Employee Benefits Expense":   -     Service cost including current service  cost, past service cost, gains and  losses on curtailments and non-routine  settlements; and   -   Net interest expense or income   iv)   Other Employee Benefits     Other  employee  benefits  comprise  of  compensated absences/leaves. The actuarial  valuation is done as per projected unit credit  method. Remeasurements as a result of  experience  adjustments  and  changes  in  actuarial assumptions are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. v)     For  the  purpose  of  presentation  of  defined  benefit  plans  and  other  long  term  benefits,  the allocation between current and  non-current provisions has been made as  determined by an actuary. q)   Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of a  qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial  period of time to get ready for its intended use or  sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.  Borrowing costs consist of interest and other  costs that an entity incurs in connection with the  borrowing of funds. Transaction costs in respect of  long-term borrowings are amortised over the tenor  of respective loans using effective interest method.  All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period  in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs also  includes exchange differences arising from foreign  currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded  as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. r)   Leases The Group assesses whether a contract contains a  lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is,  or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right  to control the use of an identified asset for a period  of time in exchange for consideration.   Group as a lessee The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a  lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,  which comprises the initial amount of the lease  liability adjusted for any lease payments made at  or before the commencement date, plus any initial  direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to  dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to  restore the site on which it is located, less any lease  incentives received. Certain lease arrangements include the option to  extend or terminate the lease before the end of  the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease  liabilities include these options when it is reasonably  certain that the option will be exercised. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using the straight-line method from the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of  the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end  of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset  is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,  and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the  lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present  value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot  be readily determined, the Group's incremental  borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest method.  It is remeasured when there is a change in future  lease payments arising from a change in an index or  rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of  the amount expected to be payable under a residual  value guarantee, or if there is a change in the lease  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 557 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 payments or a change in the assessment of an  option to purchase the underlying asset. For a lease modification that is not a separate lease,  at the effective date of the modification, the lessee  accounts for the lease modification by remeasuring  the lease liability using a discount rate determined  at that date and the lessee makes a corresponding  adjustment to the right-of-use asset. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero. Lease payments have been classified as financing  activities in Statement of Cash Flow. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases  that have a lease term of less than or equal to 12  months with no purchase option and assets with  low value leases. The Group recognises the lease  payments associated with these leases as an  expense in statement of profit and loss over the  lease term. The related cash flows are classified as  operating activities.   Group as a lessor Leases  in  which  the  Group  does  not  transfer  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  of  an  asset  are  classified  as  operating  leases.  Rental income from operating lease is recognised  on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant  lease. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in  the period in which they are earned. Leases  are  classified  as  finance  leases  when  substantially all of the risks and rewards of  ownership transfer from the Group to the lessee.  Amounts  due  from  lessees  under  finance  leases  are  recorded  as  receivables  at  the  Group’s  net  investment in the leases. Finance lease income  is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect  a constant periodic rate of return on the net  investment outstanding in respect of the lease. s)   Business Combination Business combinations are accounted for using the  acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an  acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets  transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities  assumed at their acquisition date i.e. the date on  which control is acquired. Contingent consideration  to be transferred is recognised at fair value  and included as part of cost of acquisition.  Transaction related costs are expensed in the period  in which the costs are incurred. For each business  combination, the Group elects whether to measure  the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair  value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s  identifiable net assets. Where the aggregate of consideration transferred  and amount recognised for non-controlling  interests exceeds the fair value of net identifiable  assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the excess  is recorded as goodwill. After initial recognition,  goodwill is tested for impairment annually and  measured at cost less any accumulated impairment  losses if any. Alternatively, in case of a bargain  purchase wherein the aggregate of consideration  transferred and amount recognised for  non-controlling interests is lower than the fair value  of  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed, the difference is recognised as capital  reserve within equity. If the initial accounting for a business combination  is incomplete by the end of reporting period in  which the combination occurs, the Group reports  provisional amounts for the items for which the  accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts  are adjusted during the measurement period, or  additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to  reflect new information obtained about facts and  circumstances that existed at the acquisition date  that, if known, would have affected the amount  recognised at that date. Business combinations involving entities under  common control are accounted for using the  pooling of interest method, wherein the assets and  liabilities of the business acquired are reflected at  carrying value. 

558 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 t)   Earnings Per Share (EPS) Basic  EPS  is  computed  by  dividing  the  profit  or  loss attributable to the owners of the Group by  the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is  computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable  to owners of the Company (after adjusting for costs  associated with dilutive potential equity shares)  by the weighted average number of equity shares  and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding  during the year. u)   Service Work in Progress Service Work in Progress is valued at lower of cost  and net realisable value. Cost is determined based  on Weighted Average Cost Method. Service Work In Progress represents closing  inventory of Washed Coal and Iron Ore which is  not owned by the Group as per the terms of Mine  Development and Operation (MDO) contract.  Hence,  this  represents  work  performed  under  contractual liability in bringing this inventory to its  present condition and location. Net realisable value is the contract price as per  the Mining Development and Operation (MDO)  agreement , less the estimated costs of completion  and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. v)   Overburden Cost Adjustment Overburden  removal  expenses  incurred  during  production stage are charged to revenue based on  waste-to-ore ratio, (commonly known as Stripping  Ratio in the industry). This ratio is taken based on  the current operational phase of overall mining  area. To the extent the current period ratio exceeds  the  expected  Stripping  Ratio  of  a  phase,  excess  overburden costs are deferred. w)   Expenditure Expenses  are  net  of  taxes  recoverable,  where applicable.

The Group's principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings, trade and other payables. The main  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's operations and projects.   Fair Value Hierarchy :     The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are  either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:   Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).     Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in  whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

(b)   Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies :     The Group's risk management activities are subject to the management direction and control under the framework  of Risk Management Policy as approved by the Board of Directors. The management ensures appropriate risk  governance framework for the Group through appropriate policies and procedures and that risks are identified,  measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives.     The Group is primarily exposed to risks resulting from fluctuation in market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk,  which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments.   (i)   Market Risk       Market risk is the risk that future earnings and fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument  may fluctuate because of changes in market price. Market risk comprises of price risk, currency risk  and interest risk.   A.   Commodity Price Risk :       The Group’s performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily coal and  also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the Group is engaged  in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close monitoring over its purchases  to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and supply scenario in the international  market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in various countries. To mitigate price risk, the  Group effectively manages availability of coal as well as price volatility through widening its sourcing base,  appropriate combination of long term and short term contracts with its vendors and customers and well  planned procurement and inventory strategy.   B.   Foreign Currency Exchange Risk :       Since the Group operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in more than  one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency or where assets or  liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency.       The  Group  evaluates  exchange  rate  exposure  arising  from  foreign  currency  transactions  and  follows  established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward and  option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks.       For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign currency  exposure, Refer Note 41.

Interest Risk :       The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash management  activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with variable interest rates.  The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans  and borrowings.       The Group's risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control of Central  Treasury Team of the Adani Group under the framework of Risk Management Policy for interest rate risk.  The  Group’s  central  treasury  team  ensures  appropriate  financial  risk  governance  framework  through  appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in  accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives.       For Group's floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the liability  outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase  or decrease is used, which represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change  in interest rate. ( `  crore) Particulars As at    March 31, 2025 As at    March 31, 2024 Variable Cost Borrowings at the year end  53,129.83   32,815.86        In case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points and all other variables were held constant, the  Group's profit before tax for the year from continuing operations would increase or decrease as follows: ( `  crore) Particulars For the year ended    March 31, 2025 For the year ended    March 31, 2024 Impact on Consolidated profit before tax for the year 265.65 164.08   (ii)   Credit Risk       Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty or customer will default on its contractual obligations  resulting in a loss to the Group. Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist  of Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets.  The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.       Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness  as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness  of counter parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits.  Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the Group's  treasury team in accordance with the Company's risk management policy. Cash and cash equivalents and  Bank deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record and high quality credit  rating and also reviews their credit-worthiness on an on-going basis.       Since the Group has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration risk  is foreseen. A significant portion of the Group's receivables are due from public sector units (which are  government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk. 40.

(Contd.)   b)     The liability for compensated absences as at the year ended March 31, 2025 is  `  159.26 crore (March 31,  2024  `  110.26 crore).   c)   Contributions to Defined Benefit Plans are as under :       The Group's Indian Subsidiaries has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded) and is governed by the Payment  of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the Act, every employee who has completed at least five year of service is  entitled to gratuity benefits on departure at 15 days basic salary (last drawn basic salary) for each completed  year of service. The scheme is funded with contributions to insurers in form of a qualifying insurance policy.       Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment  risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk Investment Risk: These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and  highly rated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to  the interest rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market  fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. Interest Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount  rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting  period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities  and vice-versa. Longevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the  best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their  employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase  the plan's liability. Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will  increase the plan's liability.       The following tables summarise the component of the net benefits expense recognised in the Consolidated  statement of profit and loss account and the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated  balance sheet for the respective plan.   1)   Net amount recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit & Loss for year ( `  crore) Particulars For the year ended    March 31, 2025 For the year ended    March 31, 2024 Current Service cost  42.45   32.66  Interest cost  13.57   12.07  Expected return on plan assets (4.11) (4.06) Net amount recognised  51.91   40.67    2)   Net amount recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income for year ( `  crore) Particulars For the year ended    March 31, 2025 For the year ended    March 31, 2024 Actuarial (Gains) / Losses  6.26   6.03  Return on plan assets, excluding amount recognised in net  interest expense (0.45) (0.01) Net amount recognised  5.81  6.02

There is no change in method of valuation for the prior period.   5)   Maturity Profile of Obligations       The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 1  Years to 27 Years (March 31, 2024: 2 Years to 27 Years).

(Contd.)   6)    Asset - Liability Matching Strategies       The company and its subsidiaries have purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash  accumulation plan in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one  year. The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening  during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets are funded  by the such companies. The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan,  the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the companies are exposed to  movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in a increase  in liability without corresponding increase in the asset).   d)     The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation, seniority,  promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market.   e)   The expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is in line with current financial year.     *    As the gratuity fund is managed by life insurance companies, details of fund invested by insurer are not  available with the Group. 52.
