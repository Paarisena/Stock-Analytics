Dividend related information   The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 24 April, 2025 has recommended a dividend of  ` 1/- per equity share of  face value of  ` 2/- each for the fiscal 2025, subject to approval of members at the ensuing AGM. The record date to  determine eligibility of members for payment of dividend is Friday, 4 July, 2025. Dividend will be paid within thirty days  from the date of the AGM, electronically through various online transfer modes to those members who have updated  their bank account details.   In terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (the “ IT Act ”) and Finance Act, 2020, the Bank is required to  deduct tax at source from dividend paid to members, at the rates prescribed thereunder. The tax rates would vary  depending on the residential status of the member and the exemptions as enumerated in the IT Act subject to fulfilling  the documentary requirements. Accordingly, to enable the Bank to determine the appropriate TDS / withholding tax  rate, members are requested to upload relevant documents, on  https://ris.kfintech.com/form15/  on or before Friday,    4 July, 2025.   Pursuant to the provisions of Sections 124 and 125 of the Act and the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority  (Accounting, Audit, Transfer and Refund) Rules, 2016 (“ IEPF Rules ”), the Bank is required to transfer the amount of  dividend lying unclaimed for a period of seven consecutive financial years from the date of its transfer to the unpaid  dividend account, to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (the “ IEPF ”). Further, the equity shares of the Bank,  on which the dividend has not been claimed for seven consecutive years, are also liable to be transferred to the IEPF.  Accordingly, unclaimed dividend in respect of fiscal 2017 was transferred by the Bank to the IEPF. Further all shares  in respect of which dividends have remained unclaimed for seven consecutive years or more for the fiscal 2017 were  transferred by the Bank to the IEPF in September, 2024.   In its endeavour to reduce the quantum of unclaimed dividend, the Bank has sent reminders to all the members whose  dividend was lying in the unclaimed dividend account. These reminders were also supported with requisite forms to  simplify the claim process and to facilitate a seamless transfer. Further, reminders to claim dividend were sent to those  members whose dividend and corresponding shares were due for transfer to the IEPF in the fiscal 2025.   Members whose unclaimed dividend, equity shares have been transferred to the IEPF, in accordance with the IEPF Rules,  may claim a refund by making an application to the IEPF authority.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Promoting enduring value   for our stakeholders Welcome to Axis Bank N. S. Vishwanathan Independent Director and   Part–time 	 Chairman Dear Shareholders, It 	 is 	 with 	 great 	 pride 	 and 	 optimism 	 that 	 I present to you Axis Bank’s Integrated  Annual 	 Report 	 for 	 the 	 financial 	 year 2024–25. This year has been a  year 	 of 	 steady 	 progress, 	 thoughtful 	 transformation, 	 and 	 continued 	 focus 	 on building a resilient and future– ready 	 institution. 	 Underpinning 	 our 	 journey 	 has 	 been 	 a 	 strong 	 commitment 	 to sound governance and robust  compliance frameworks–ensuring that  our growth is not only sustainable but  also responsible. The 	 global 	 economy 	 is 	 in 	 flux 	 as 	 the 	 U.S. 	 undertakes 	 structural 	 shifts 	 in 	 trade, 	 taxation, 	 and 	 regulation 	 to 	 address 	 domestic 	 imbalances. 	 According to the IMF, the global  economy appears to be entering  a 	 period 	 of 	 transition, 	 as 	 the 	   long–standing economic framework of  the past 80 years undergoes a reset.    A 	 key 	 element 	 has 	 been 	 the 	 imposition 	 of 	 tariffs, 	 particularly 	 targeting 	 China, 	 which has disrupted global supply  chains and increased costs. While some  tariffs 	 have 	 been 	 partially 	 rolled 	 back, 	 uncertainty around future trade rules  continues 	 to 	 delay 	 investments 	 and 	 tighten 	 financial 	 conditions. 	 Currency 	 volatility 	 and 	 geopolitical 	 tensions 	 further weigh on global growth.  Reflecting 	 this 	 uncertainty, 	 the 	 IMF 	 has revised its global growth forecast  for 2025 downward by 0.5% to 2.8%.  However, 	 coordinated 	 fiscal 	 action 	 in 	 Europe 	 and 	 China, 	 or 	 resolution 	 of 	 major 	 conflicts, 	 could 	 help 	 restore 	 confidence 	 and 	 economic 	 momentum. India’s 	 moderated 	 growth 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2025 	 reflected 	 a 	 period 	 of 	 prudent 	 fiscal 	 and 	 monetary 	 consolidation. 	 With 	 the 	 temporary 	 effects 	 of 	 election–related 	 spending pauses now behind us and a  more 	 measured 	 fiscal 	 easing 	 anticipated 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2026, 	 government 	 expenditure 	 is poised to return to a more normalised  and 	 growth–supportive 	 trajectory, 	 setting 	 the 	 stage 	 for 	 a 	 renewed 	 momentum. On the monetary front,  recent 	 RBI 	 actions—CRR 	 cuts, 	 bond 	 purchases, 	 and 	 liquidity 	 easing—are 	 restoring 	 credit 	 flow 	 and 	 supporting 	 growth. 	 Inflation 	 below 	 4% 	 has 	 shifted 	 policy focus squarely to expansion.  India remains resilient to global shocks,  with strong services exports, rising  competitiveness 	 in 	 manufacturing, 	 Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 14 

Chairman’s statement and gains from the “China + 1” strategy.  These 	 structural 	 strengths 	 position 	 India for a robust and broad–based  economic rebound. We delivered a consolidated RoA of  1.77% 	 and 	 RoE 	 of 	 16.89% 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2025 and our focus on high RAROC  businesses 	 continues 	 to 	 drive 	 healthy 	 growth across our focus segment of  Small Business Banking, SME, and Mid– Corporate, growing 14% y–o–y and  now forming ~23% of our loan book,  up ~740 bps in four years. Our balance  sheet remains strong, backed by best– in–class asset quality metrics with net  NPA 	 at 	 0.33% 	 and 	 ₹11,957 	 crores 	 in 	 non–NPA provisions. With a CET–1  ratio 	 of 	 14.67%, 	 up 	 93 	 bps 	 y–o–y 	 largely 	 through 	 organic 	 accretion, 	 we 	 are well–capitalised to invest in future  growth. Prudent risk management,  disciplined 	 execution, 	 and 	 strong 	 internal 	 accruals 	 continue 	 to 	   position 	 us 	 well 	 to 	 deliver, 	   high–quality performance. Our customer obsession program,  Sparsh 2.0 is a bold step forward– seamlessly 	 connecting 	 our 	 people– first 	 initiatives 	 to 	 elevate 	 customer 	 experiences, driving stronger Net  Promoter Score, and unlocking  meaningful business growth through  empathy and excellence. We’re proud to share that Axis Bank  has once again been rated in the  top–tier 	 “Leadership” 	 category 	 in 	 the Indian Corporate Governance  Scorecard (December 2024) by  IiAS. 	 This 	 recognition 	 reflects 	 our 	 unwavering commitment to corporate  governance and regulatory excellence.  The 	 evaluation, 	 based 	 on 	 globally 	 benchmarked G20/OECD principles,  reaffirms 	 our 	 industry 	 leadership 	 and 	 dedication 	 to 	 the 	 highest 	 standards 	 of 	 accountability and transparency. At Axis Bank, our philosophy is  anchored in sustainable growth  and 	 creating 	 long–term 	 value 	 for 	 our 	 customers and stakeholders. In recent  years, 	 we 	 have 	 made 	 substantial 	 strides in reinforcing our governance  architecture and strengthened over  risk, 	 audit, 	 and 	 compliance 	 functions. 	 Our steadfast commitment to  excellence in corporate governance is  reflected 	 in 	 the 	 rigorous 	 standards 	 we 	 uphold and the comprehensive policies  we implement across every dimension  of 	 our 	 operations. At Axis Bank, ESG is deeply embedded  in our strategic vision, with dedicated  structures 	 driving 	 focused 	 action. 	 In 	 2021, 	 we 	 became 	 the 	 first 	 Indian 	 bank 	 to establish a standalone Board–level  ESG 	 Committee, 	 aligning 	 diverse 	 priorities 	 under 	 a 	 unified 	 ESG 	 agenda. 	 This 	 Committee 	 met 	 four 	 times 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 reviewing 	 progress 	 and 	 guiding 	 new 	 initiatives. 	 Our 	 ESG 	 commitments are aligned with the UN  Sustainable Development Goals and  India’s Paris Agreement commitments.  We 	 exceeded 	 our 	 ₹30,000 	 crores 	 sustainable wholesale lending target  well ahead of the 2026 deadline,  consequently, we raised our target  to 	 ₹60,000 	 crores 	 by 	 2030, 	 with 	 ₹48,412 	 crores 	 already 	 achieved 	 by 	 March 	 31, 	 2025. 	 We 	 continue 	 to 	 maintain an exposure to coal and  thermal power well within our glide  path 	 limits. 	 Additionally, 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 our 	 commitment to achieving 30% women  representation 	 in 	 our 	 workforce 	 by 	 fiscal 	 2027, 	 we 	 are 	 actively 	 scaling 	 up 	 diverse hiring across all businesses and  support 	 functions, 	 while 	 launching 	 innovative 	 initiatives 	 that 	 truly 	 reflect 	 our 	 organisational 	 values. As 	 a 	 responsible 	 corporate 	 citizen, 	 we 	 continue 	 to 	 drive 	 meaningful 	 impact through our CSR arm, Axis  Bank 	 Foundation 	 (ABF), 	 and 	 strategic 	 partnerships. Since 2018, ABF has been  relentlessly driving ‘Mission 2 Million’  to 	 uplift 	 2 	 million 	 households 	 across 	 India. 	 By 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 ABF 	 not 	 only 	 met 	 but 	 surpassed 	 this 	 goal—impacting 	 ~2.05 	 million 	 participants 	 across 	 300 districts in 32 states and union  territories as of March 31, 2025.    In 	 this 	 fiscal 	 alone, 	 we 	 reached 	   ~0.39 	 million 	 participants 	 nationwide. 	 Moreover, 	 we 	 amplified 	 our 	 impact 	 in 	 the 	 Education 	 theme—expanding 	 Axis 	 DilSe ® 	 to 	 new 	 remote 	 frontiers, 	 forging 	 powerful partnerships to strengthen  education 	 systems, 	 and 	 backing 	 cutting–edge 	 research 	 and 	 innovation. 	 Each achievement is a step toward a  greater 	 vision—one 	 where 	 opportunity, 	 equity, and sustainability are accessible  to 	 all. 	 The 	 Bank’s 	 journey 	 is 	 far 	 from 	 over, 	 and 	 its 	 commitment 	 to 	 creating 	 lasting 	 impact 	 has 	 never 	 been 	 stronger. 	 Guided by the  ‘open’  philosophy, we  will 	 continue 	 to 	 push 	 boundaries, 	 scale impact, and build a future where  inclusive growth and sustainability go  hand in hand. As we look ahead, I would like to take  a 	 moment 	 to 	 acknowledge 	 Mr. 	 Rajiv 	 Anand, 	 who 	 will 	 be 	 retiring 	 in 	 August 	 2025 	 after 	 an 	 exceptional 	 16–year 	 journey 	 with 	 Axis 	 Group. 	 His 	 visionary 	 leadership has been instrumental in  shaping 	 our 	 digital 	 and 	 innovative 	 solutions–led 	 franchise. 	 We 	 thank 	 him 	 for 	 his 	 invaluable 	 contributions 	 and 	 lasting 	 impact 	 on 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 growth 	 and culture. Warm regards,  N. S. Vishwanathan Independent Director and    Part–time 	 Chairman 15

OPERATING LANDSCAPE Staying ahead in   a dynamically   evolving  environment Welcome to Axis Bank The Bank operates in a dynamic business  environment, competing with large private  and public sector banks, nimble digital  challengers, and non–banking    financial institutions. We remain  differentiated through scale, discipline,    and purpose–led innovation in this    fast–moving ecosystem. Positioned for Progress in a Dynamic Environment Fiscal 2025 unfolded against a backdrop of subdued  global momentum. Advanced economies grappled  with 	 persistent 	 inflation, 	 high 	 interest 	 rates, 	 and 	 tight 	 liquidity, 	 prompting 	 cautious 	 capital 	 deployment 	 and 	 slower 	 credit 	 expansion. 	 The 	 swift 	 escalation 	 of 	 trade 	 tensions and extremely high levels of policy uncertainty  are 	 expected 	 to 	 have 	 a 	 significant 	 impact 	 on 	 global 	 economic 	 activity, 	 posing 	 new 	 headwinds 	 for 	 global 	 growth 	 and 	 inflation. 	 Global 	 growth 	 is 	 projected 	 to 	 drop 	 to 	 3% 	 in 	 2026, 	 financial 	 markets 	 remain 	 sensitive 	 to 	 geopolitical 	 tensions, 	 supply 	 chain 	 disruptions, 	 and 	 diverging monetary policies. The 	 Bank 	 remains 	 strongly 	 positioned 	 to 	 navigate 	 this 	 evolving 	 environment. 	 With 	 a 	 well–diversified 	 credit 	 portfolio, 	 robust 	 liability 	 engine, 	 and 	 96%+ 	 digital 	 transaction 	 penetration, 	 the 	 Bank 	 is 	 focused 	 on 	 delivering 	 sustainable, risk–aware growth. Through the ‘One Axis’  ecosystem, the Bank integrates banking with insurance,  investments, broking, and capital markets, serving  customers across geographies and segments. Our calibrated  approach to compliance, technology, and    customer–centricity 	 keeps 	 opportunities 	 open 	 for 	 us 	 across 	 every economic cycle. Fiscal 	 2025 	 marked 	 a 	 significant 	 regulatory 	 pivot 	 toward 	 risk 	 sensitivity, 	 digital 	 integrity, 	 and 	 sustainability. 	 The 	 RBI 	 tightened 	 norms 	 on 	 unsecured 	 lending, 	 enhanced 	 supervision 	 of 	 digital 	 journeys, 	 and 	 released 	 draft 	 frameworks 	 on 	 climate–related 	 financial 	 disclosures. 	 Concurrently, SEBI mandated BRSR Core assurance, and  the 	 Digital 	 Personal 	 Data 	 Protection 	 (DPDP) 	 Act 	 was 	 enacted to strengthen data privacy rights. Regulatory  bodies 	 are 	 now 	 setting 	 the 	 tone 	 for 	 integrated, 	   forward–looking governance. Unlike 	 global 	 trends, 	 India 	 remained 	 a 	 bright 	 spot 	 with 	 estimated 	 GDP 	 growth 	 of 	 6.5% 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2026. 	 Sustained 	 demand 	 from 	 rural 	 areas, 	 an 	 anticipated 	 revival 	 in 	 urban 	 consumption, 	 expected 	 recovery 	 of 	 fixed 	 capital 	 formation 	 supported 	 by 	 increased government capital expenditure, higher capacity  utilisation, 	 and 	 healthy 	 balance 	 sheets 	 of 	 corporates 	 and 	 banks 	 are 	 expected 	 to 	 support 	 growth. 	 Domestic 	 consumption, 	 infrastructure–led 	 investments, 	 and 	 financial 	 formalisation 	 continued 	 to 	 fuel 	 banking 	 sector 	 growth, 	 particularly 	 in 	 retail, 	 secured 	 lending, 	 and 	 MSMEs. 	 Simultaneously, 	 competition 	 intensified, 	 driven 	 by 	 a 	 maturing 	 fintech 	 ecosystem, 	 NBFC 	 innovations, 	 and 	 digital–first 	 challenger 	 models. 	 UPI 	 volumes, 	 AI–enabled 	 credit, 	 and 	 embedded 	 finance 	 redefine 	 how 	 services 	 are delivered and consumed.

Operating 	 landscape Trend What’s Changing Strategic Implication Formal Credit Expansion MSMEs, secured retail loans, and  housing 	 finance 	 drive 	 credit 	 growth 	 amid policy support and    demand revival. We 	 continue 	 to 	 expand 	 our 	 focus 	 segments with calibrated growth in  secured lending and deeper    penetration 	 in 	 semi–urban 	 and 	 rural markets. Deposit Mobilisation    Pressure Tight liquidity and elevated rates  have 	 intensified 	 competition 	 for 	 granular deposits. We 	 have 	 improved 	 the 	 granularisation 	 in 	 our deposit book and the quality of LCR  deposits 	 through 	 targeted 	 acquisitions, 	 product launches, salary credits, and  CASA deepening across Bharat branches. Regulatory Tightening RBI and SEBI introduced new  frameworks on unsecured lending,  ESG disclosures (BRSR Core), and data  protection 	 (DPDP 	 Act). We 	 have 	 proactively 	 enhanced 	 governance, upgraded risk models, and  embedded compliance–by–design across  digital and ESG processes. Digital–first    Consumer Behaviour UPI, mobile onboarding, and API  ecosystems are now the default  channels 	 for 	 financial 	 engagement. With 	 96%+ 	 digital 	 transactions 	 and 	   GenAI–powered tools like Adi,  neo   and ‘ Siddhi’ 	 we 	 continue 	 to 	 lead 	 in 	 delivering 	 intuitive, 	 secure, 	 and 	 intelligent 	 customer 	 journeys. Climate and Sustainability    Integration Climate risk is becoming integral  to credit assessment and  disclosure mandates. Through Sustainable bonds, lending to  ESG 	 positive 	 sectors, 	 and 	 an 	 in–house 	 ESG 	 Rating 	 model 	 for 	 borrower–level 	 risk 	 review, 	 we 	 are 	 future–proofing 	 our 	 portfolio 	 with 	 responsibility. Rise of AI and   Embedded Finance GenAI, credit scoring algorithms, and  open architecture reshape product  delivery 	 and 	 underwriting. We are building an open, API–led,    AI–enabled 	 ecosystem—integrating 	 our 	   offerings 	 into 	 platforms, 	 partners, 	 and 	 everyday 	 financial 	 flows. What’s Reshaping Indian Banking  27

Through this simple yet powerful moment, we highlighted how a mother’s  trust in Fixed Deposits is born from pure love and a deep desire to secure a  safe and prosperous future for her child. Welcome to Axis Bank Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 36 

We launched a heartwarming campaign that brought to life a familiar, endearing  quirk 	 of 	 fathers—the 	 ever–present 	 “thumbs 	 up” 	 in 	 chat 	 conversations. 	 The 	 narrative 	 captured 	 an 	 emotional 	 moment 	 when 	 a 	 daughter’s 	 decision 	 to 	 invest 	 in Fixed Deposits earned her father’s silent yet powerful approval, expressed  through 	 a 	 burst 	 of 	 heart 	 emojis. 	 Through 	 this 	 simple 	 and 	 relatable 	 story, 	   we highlighted the deep sense of trust, pride, and security that Fixed Deposits  represent for Indian families. Marketing 	 Initiatives 37 

Sanskrit Passwor d On Independence Day, we launched  #SanskritPassword, a unique campaign that  combined 	 cyber 	 security 	 innovation 	 with 	 India’s 	 rich cultural legacy. Through  sanskritpassword. com , we introduced a smarter and stronger  password system that leverages the complexity  and uniqueness of Sanskrit – one of the world’s  oldest and least commonly used languages today.  By 	 tapping 	 into 	 Sanskrit’s 	 grammatical 	 richness 	 and 	 unfamiliarity 	 in 	 the 	 digital 	 space, 	 we 	 offered 	 users 	 a 	 highly 	 secure 	 alternative 	 to 	 conventional 	 passwords, making it far more resistant to  modern 	 hacking 	 tools. 	 This 	 initiative 	 positioned 	 Sanskrit 	 not 	 just 	 as 	 a 	 cultural 	 symbol 	 but 	 as 	 a 	 groundbreaking 	 solution 	 for 	 next–generation 	 cyber security.

Value  creation   by the Bank Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 42 

Axis Bank creates long–term value by aligning its strategy  with stakeholder needs and the priorities of a dynamic,  developing India. Our business model transforms financial  and non–financial resources into impactful financial  products, services, and digital experiences that advance  inclusion, innovation, and sustainability. By staying agile,  responsible, and future–ready, we continue to generate  meaningful outcomes for our customers, communities,  employees, and shareholders. This approach not only  enhances performance and trust but also reinforces our role  in supporting India’s economic and social transformation. 43 

VALUE CREATION MODEL Blueprint for sustainable value creation Value creation by the bank The 	 Bank’s 	 business 	 model 	 reflects 	 our 	 steadfast 	 commitment 	 to 	 creating 	 long–term, value for all stakeholders. We channel diverse forms of capital  into sustainable growth outcomes,  aligning purpose with performance.  At the heart of this model lies our  brand promise,  ‘Har raah dil se open’ ,  symbolising our openness to people,  partnerships, progress and the planet.  Guided by our Vision, Mission and  Values. We endeavour to understand  stakeholder needs and societal  expectations 	 and 	 drive 	 strategic 	 action. Capitals As 	 defined 	 by 	 the 	 <IR> 	 Framework, 	 capitals are the key resources and  relationships 	 an 	 organisation 	 draws 	 upon to create, deliver, and sustain  value 	 over 	 time. 	 These 	 include 	 financial 	 resources, physical and technological  assets, 	 human 	 skills 	 and 	 capabilities, 	 institutional 	 knowledge, 	 stakeholder 	 relationships, 	 and 	 natural 	 ecosystems. 	 Together, 	 these 	 form 	 the 	 foundation 	 of 	 an 	 organisation’s 	 ability 	 to 	 operate, 	 innovate, and grow responsibly. The Framework outlines six    capitals–Financial, Manufactured,  Intellectual, Human, Social and  Relationship, 	 and 	 Natural–to 	 encourage integrated thinking across  all 	 dimensions 	 of 	 value. 	 Evaluating 	 Axis 	 Bank through this framework enables  a 	 holistic 	 understanding 	 of 	 how 	 we 	 deploy 	 resources, 	 manage 	 trade–offs, 	 and generate long–term outcomes for  our stakeholders, aligning with    our purpose, vision, and mission. Inputs Inputs 	 represent 	 the 	 foundation 	 of 	 the 	 value 	 creation 	 process 	 for 	 the year. Input capitals comprise  of 	 financial 	 capital 	 shown 	 in 	 the 	 standalone 	 and 	 consolidated 	 financial 	 statements 	 of 	 the 	 Bank 	 and 	 ‘off– balance sheet’ or ‘hidden’ capital,  such 	 as 	 the 	 institutional 	 knowledge 	 of 	 the 	 Bank, 	 the 	 reputation 	 it 	 has 	 built 	 over the years, and the strength of  its 	 relationships 	 with 	 stakeholders. 	 The Bank harnesses and transforms  these inputs through its strategy,  business 	 model, 	 and 	 operations 	 to 	 generate outputs (e.g., loans, digital  transactions, 	 products) 	 and 	 outcomes 	 (e.g., 	 stakeholder 	 value, 	 financial 	 performance, societal impact). The  efficiency, 	 quality, 	 and 	 sustainability 	 with 	 which 	 an 	 organisation 	 utilises 	 its 	 inputs 	 significantly 	 influence 	 long–term 	 performance, 	 capital 	 appreciation 	 or 	 depletion, 	 stakeholder 	 trust, 	 and 	 risk resilience. Value Driver Activities A 	 clearly 	 defined 	 strategic 	 intent 	 drives 	 Axis 	 Bank’s 	 value 	 creation 	 process   Our Vision, Mission, and Values,    focused on customer centricity,  ethics, ownership, transparency, and  teamwork aid this process. Grounded  in 	 our 	 purpose, 	 we 	 utilise 	 diverse 	 inputs across six capitals to fuel our  business 	 operations. 	 These 	 operations 	 constitute 	 the 	 core 	 of 	 Axis 	 Bank. 	 Our understanding of the external  environment, 	 identifying 	 key 	 issues, 	 and 	 proactive 	 stakeholder 	 engagement 		 help us stay agile and responsive amid  dynamic 	 conditions. With a strong strategy and resource  allocation 	 underpinned 	 by 	 integrated 	 risk management, we transform  these inputs into outputs that yield  sustainable results. These results  enhance the value of our capitals  over 	 time, 	 as 	 demonstrated 	 by 	 our 	 performance 	 in 	 financial 	 strength, 	 digital leadership, social impact, and  environmental responsibility. We aim to  deliver 	 future–ready 	 solutions, 	 deepen 	 inclusion, and embed sustainability  throughout our business.    This approach embodies our  commitment to being open to all  stakeholders, 	 opportunities, 	 and 	 possibilities 	 for 	 long–term, 	 sustainable 	 value 	 creation. Output Outputs are the direct and tangible  results of the Bank’s business  operations, 	 including 	 products 	 delivered, services provided, customer  interactions, 	 and 	 digital 	 engagements. 	 They signify what we generate  by 	 effectively 	 utilising 	 inputs 	 and 	 executing 	 on 	 our 	 strategic 	 priorities. 	   These outputs stem from our core  value 	 driver 	 activities 	 and 	 are 	 influenced 	 by 	 our 	 Mission, 	 Vision, 	 Values, 	 stakeholder 	 expectations, 	 and decisions informed by  risk 	 considerations. Nevertheless, outputs by themselves  do not indicate long–term success.    They pave the way for broader  outcomes 	 and 	 lasting 	 impacts 	 on 	 our 	 stakeholders and the six capitals.  For instance, a loan (output) fosters  financial 	 inclusion 	 (outcome); 	 a 	 digital 	 onboarding process boosts customer  satisfaction; 	 and 	 the 	 issuance 	 of 	 a 	 green bond can support emissions  reduction 	 by 	 industry. 	 Thus, 	 through 	 our 	 value 	 driver 	 activities, 	 outputs 	 serve as pathways that convert  strategy 	 into 	 action 	 and 	 action 	 into 	 impact, bridging the gap between what  we 	 do 	 and 	 why 	 it 	 is 	 significant, 	 aligning 	 with 	 our 	 purpose 	 of 	 creating 	 lasting, 	 sustainable value for everyone. Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 44 

We have mapped the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to our six–capital model to align  our 	 value 	 creation 	 process 	 with 	 global 	 priorities 	 and 	 ensure 	 that 	 our 	 business 	 contributes 	 meaningfully 	 to 	 inclusive, 	 equitable, 	 and 	 sustainable 	 development. 	 This 	 integration 	 helps 	 us 	 demonstrate how using and enhancing the six capitals supports broader societal outcomes.  Mapping SDGs  with capitals Outcome Outcomes represent the long–term  impacts of the Bank’s outputs,  illustrating 	 how 	 our 	 products, 	 services, 	 and 	 actions 	 influence 	 the 	 creation, 	 preservation 	 or 	 erosion 	 of 	 the 	 six 	 capitals 	 over 	 time. 	 Outputs 	 indicate the immediate results of our  business 	 operations. 	 At 	 the 	 same 	 time, 	 outcomes 	 reflect 	 the 	 deeper 	 value 	 generated 	 for 	 stakeholders: 	 financial 	 inclusion, customer trust, employee  development, community wellbeing,  environmental sustainability, and  systemic resilience.  Our 	 value 	 driver 	 activities 	 allow 	 us 	 to 	 create and sustain value for the Bank  and society.  For instance, when a loan is provided  (an output), it transforms into an  outcome if it aids a small growth of  business 	 or 	 helps 	 an 	 individual 	 attain 	 financial 	 security. 	 This 	 outcome 	 promotes 	 long–term 	 value 	 creation 	 across 	 customers, 	 communities, 	 investors, employees,    and the environment. Value 	 creation 	 model Value Creation in Action Our 	 value 	 creation 	 model 	 comes 	 to 	 life 	 through 	 everyday 	 stories 	 where 	 strategy 	 and 	 purpose 	 intersect. 	 By 	 applying 	 integrated 	 thinking 	 across 	 the 	 six 	 capitals, 	 we 	 transform 	 inputs 	 into 	 meaningful 	 outcomes, 	 yielding 	 financial 	 profits 	 along 	 with 	 societal 	 and 	 environmental 	 benefits. 	 The 	 following 	 case 	 study 	 illustrates 	 how 	 one 	 such 	 intervention 	 generates 	 lasting 	 value.

Value creation by the bank STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT  Engaging with purpose  and addressing what  matters We conduct a formal Stakeholder  Engagement and Materiality  Assessment (SEMA) exercise  periodically, engaging with both  our internal stakeholders, such  as employees, and external  stakeholders, such as our  customers. Engaging with our  stakeholders helps us maintain  a 	 strong, 	 organisation–wide 	 grievance redressal framework,  ensuring stakeholders,  expectations 	 and 	 concerns 	 are 	 addressed promptly, reinforcing  trust and accountability. In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 the 	 Bank 	 conducted 	 a fresh SEMA exercise, which  included 	 for 	 the 	 first 	 time 	 a 	 Double Materiality Assessment.  Based on our internal survey  and benchmarking exercise, the  identified 	 stakeholders 	 were 	 prioritised 	 according 	 to 	 their 	 influence 	 and 	 impact. At Axis Bank, meaningful  engagement with our  stakeholders is essential  to understand their  expectations.   This commitment to  purposeful engagement  helps us gauge the internal  and external business  environment and assess key  material issues and risks  based on their severity and  likelihood of occurrence.  It also shapes our business  purpose and guides our    strategy to create long–term  sustainable value.

Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder Identification  Key 	 stakeholder 	 groups 	 were 	 identified 	 through a comprehensive internal  assessment and industry benchmarking  exercise. The process mapped how  stakeholders 	 affect 	 and 	 are 	 affected 	 by 	   the 	 Bank’s 	 operations. Our Approach to Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality in Fiscal 2025 Categorisation and Prioritisation   Stakeholders 	 were 	 prioritised 	 and 	 categorised based on their relevance,  significance, 	 and 	 impact 	 on 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 value 	 creation 	 process. 	 They 	 were 	 systematically 	 classified 	 into 	 internal, 	 external, 	 and 	 affected 	 stakeholder 	 groups 	 to support focused engagement. Stakeholder Engagement To ensure our strategy aligns with our  stakeholders’ 	 priorities 	 and 	 creates 	 mutual 	 value, 	 we 	 systematically 	 map 	 and 	 identify 	 stakeholders 	 based 	 on 	 their 	 potential 	 impact 	 on 	 our 	 business, 	 their 	 influence 	 (direct 	 and 	 indirect), 	 and our impact on them. Following  internal assessments and leadership  discussions, 	 we 	 identified 	 8 	 key 	 stakeholder groups, encompassing  Investors, Customers, Regulators &  Identification of IROs    (Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities)  15 	 material 	 IROs 	 were 	 identified 	 through 	 in–depth research, peer benchmarking,  internal 	 deliberations, 	 and 	 alignment 	 with the European Sustainability  Reporting 	 Standards 	 (ESRS). 	 These 	 IROs 	 reflect 	 actual 	 or 	 potential 	 positive 	 and 	 negative 	 impacts, 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 associated 	 risks 	 and 	 opportunities, 	 arising 	 from 	 the Bank’s business model and value  creation 	 activities. Stakeholder Engagement and Double  Materiality Assessment A customised survey framework was  designed in line with the Corporate  Sustainability 	 Reporting 	 Directive 	   (CSRD) to assess double materiality:   » Impact Materiality    (Inside–out Perspective)   Evaluated 	 the 	 significance 	 and 	 severity of impacts based on their  scale, scope,  and  irremediability   over short, medium, and long–term  timeframes 	 for 	 the 	 identified 	 IROs.   » Financial Materiality    (Outside–in Perspective)   Assessed the likelihood and  potential 	 magnitude 	 of 	 financial 	 impacts of material issues on the  Bank’s performance in the short,  medium, and long term. Impact Prioritisation and Materiality  Matrix Development Material 	 topics 	 were 	 prioritised 	 by 	 integrating 	 the 	 outcomes 	 of 	 both 	 impact 	 and 	 financial 	 materiality 	 assessments. 	   The 	 final 	 Materiality 	 Matrix 	 was 	 developed 	 by 	 plotting 	 the 	 prioritised 	 IROs 	 to 	 visually 	 represent 	 their 	 significance 	 across 	 the 	 double materiality dimensions. Policymakers, 	 Communities 	 & 	 NGOs, 	 Industry 	 & 	 Peers, 	 Rating 	 Agencies, 	 Value Chain Partners, and Employees.  To connect with these diverse groups,  we undertook planned engagements  through regular customer surveys,  investor 	 meetings, 	 employee 	 town 	 halls, and other means, focusing on  responsive, need–based dialogue. 1 4 5 2 3 49 

Value creation by the bank Investors Why They Matter Investors play a pivotal role in the growth and sustainability of a bank. For a rapidly developing economy like India,  access to growth capital is essential, and investors are not only stakeholders but also the providers of capital–both  in the form of equity and debt instruments such as bonds. Their confidence and continued support are vital for  maintaining financial stability and fostering long–term value creation. A structured and proactive communication  with market participants, including investors, ensures transparency, builds trust, and facilitates a continuous    two–way dialogue that contributes to efficient price discovery.

Rating Agencies  Why They Matter Rating agencies (both credit and ESG) significantly influence the Bank’s financial health and public perception.  Their assessments directly impact the Bank’s access to capital, influencing the interest rates on instruments issued  by the Bank, ultimately affecting the cost of capital. How We Connect   » One–on–one 	 meetings 	 and 	 group 	 meetings   » Email correspondence   » Submissions 	 of 	 financial 	 & 	 non–financial 	 performance 	 for 	 issuance 	 & 	 review 	 of 	 ratings Periodic/Need–based Frequency What Matters Most to Them   » Financial parameters  and 	 profitability   » ESG 	 performance 	 & 	 reporting Shared Value Creation Axis 	 Bank’s 	 strong 	 credit 	 Ratings 	 and 	 ESG 	 ratings/scores 	 are 	 a 	 direct 	 result 	 of 	 its 	 disciplined 	 financial 	 management, 	 sound 	 governance, 	 and 	 sustainability 	 integration.

Value creation by the bank Following the Stakeholder  Engagement and Materiality  Assessment undertaken by the  Bank 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2022 	 and 	 the 	 subsequent stakeholder feedback,  we adopted a ‘Double Materiality’  approach 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2025 	 to 	 assess 	 the material issues relevant to  the Bank. A total of 15 IROs were  identified 	 based 	 on 	 our 	 internal 	 assessment, sector research, peer  review and benchmarking, and  secondary sources.  During the ‘Double Materiality  Assessment’ 	 for 	 the 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 we considered how the Bank’s  operations 	 affect 	 the 	 environment 	 and people while also assessing  how 	 the 	 IROs 	 affect 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 long–term 	 value, 	 financial 	 performance, and resilience.  We considered both the actual  and 	 potential, 	 positive 	 and 	 negative, 	 societal and environmental footprint  across short term, medium term and  long term. The Bank aligned its methodology  with leading global benchmarks,  including the Corporate Sustainability  Reporting 	 Directive 	 (CSRD) 	 and 	 European 	 Sustainability 	 Reporting 	 Standards (ESRS) on double  materiality. Our comprehensive  assessment also resonates with the  guiding principles of the BRSR and  <IR> 	 frameworks. 	 We 	 strongly 	 believe 	 that 	 continuous 	 engagement with our stakeholders  is 	 essential 	 to 	 truly 	 understand 	 the issues that are of the greatest  importance 	 to 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 operations. 	 We 	 recognise 	 that 	 stakeholders 	 often 	 have 	 diverse 	 and, 	 at 	 times, 	 opposing 	 perspectives 	 on 	 these 	 critical 	 matters. To ensure long–term  sustainability and value  creation, Axis Bank  proactively identifies  and manages relevant  Impacts, Risks, and  Opportunities (IROs) in the  rapidly evolving financial  sector.

Business  performance  review Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 68 

Axis Bank delivered a strong performance in fiscal 2025,  marked by healthy growth across core operating metrics,  disciplined cost management, and continued improvements  in asset quality. The Bank’s balanced growth strategy,  underpinned by a resilient franchise and prudent risk  practices, helped it navigate market dynamics effectively.  A sharp focus on customer–centricity, digital innovation,  and operating efficiency contributed to steady gains in  profitability and stakeholder value. 69 

Dear Shareholders, Fiscal 2025 was a pivotal year that  showcased our ability to adapt, lead,  and innovate in an ever–evolving  financial 	 landscape—one 	 that 	 tested 	 our resilience, sharpened our strategic  focus, 	 and 	 reaffirmed 	 our 	 commitment 	 to building a future–ready, customer– centric 	 institution. 	 Since 	 the 	 inception 	 of our GPS strategy in 2019, we have  been on a mission to reimagine Axis  Bank as a stronger, more agile, and  more 	 inclusive 	 financial 	 institution. 	 Through 	 disciplined 	 execution 	 and 	 focused investments in people,  processes, technology, and high–impact  initiatives, 	 the 	 Bank 	 has 	 evolved 	 into 	 a 	 stronger 	 and 	 more 	 resilient 	 organisation 	 towards 	 its 	 journey 	 to 	 become 	 an 	   “all–weather 	 institution”. Our unwavering focus on high RAROC  businesses 	 continues 	 to 	 be 	 a 	 key 	 growth engine, propelling us forward  with strong momentum across Small  Business Banking, SME, and Mid– Corporate segments. This year, we  achieved 	 a 	 record 	 500 	 new 	 branches— an expansion that not only deepens  our presence but also strengthens  our ability to serve customers across  India more meaningfully. Our deposit  franchise has improved in both quality  and cost parameters, and on the growth  front we are focused on building a  sustainable 	 franchise 	 through 	 multiple 	 initiatives 	 taken 	 by 	 the 	 Bank. We 	 have 	 sustained 	 our 	 position 	 among the top players in high– impact businesses such as Wealth  Management and Payments, where  our 	 customer–first 	 approach 	 and 	 product 	 innovation 	 continue 	 to 	 set 	 us 	 apart. 	 Our 	 flagship 	 digital 	 platforms, 	 ‘open’  and ‘ neo ’, have maintained their  strong 	 positions 	 across 	 Retail 	 and 	 Wholesale 	 Banking, 	 respectively, 	 reinforcing our role as a frontrunner in  digital 	 transformation. 	 Our commitment to customer  satisfaction 	 remains 	 steadfast, 	 as 	 evidenced by our #2 Net Promoter  Score (NPS) ranking among large peer  banks, as independently benchmarked  by 	 Kantar. 	 This 	 recognition 	 is 	 a 	 reflection 	 of 	 the 	 trust 	 and 	 loyalty 	   we have earned through consistently  improving service excellence. MD & CEO’S STATEMENT Building a customer obsessed,  resilient institution Business Performance Review Amitabh Chaudhry Managing 	 Director 	 and 	 Chief 	 Executive 	 Officer Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 70 

MD & CEO’s statement We delivered a consolidated Return on  Assets of 1.77% and Return on Equity  of 	 16.89% 	 for 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 outcomes 	 driven 	 by 	 disciplined 	 execution 	 as 	 operating 	 leverage 	 aided 	 healthy 	 core 	 operating 	 profit 	 performance. 	 Our 	 core 	 operating 	 profit 	 grew 	 13% 	 y–o–y, 	 supported by a best–in–class fee–to– average–assets 	 ratio, 	 healthy 	 NIMs 	 of 	 3.98%, and a prudent 6% growth in  operating 	 expenses 	 for 	 fiscal 	 2025. 	   Our 	 liquidity 	 position 	 remains 	 strong, 	 with an average LCR of 119% for  quarter ended March 31, 2025. We 	 remain 	 deeply 	 committed 	 to 	 profitable 	 and 	 sustainable 	 growth, 	   with calibrated risk management across  portfolios, 	 as 	 we 	 stay 	 focussed 	 on 	 three 	 core 	 areas 	 of 	 execution 	 of 	 our 	 GPS strategy:   » Becoming a resilient,    all–weather Franchise   » Creating 	 multiplicative 	 forces 	 to 	 build 	 competitive 	 advantage   » Building for the future  with a relentless focus on  driving 	 distinctiveness Becoming a resilient,    all–weather Franchise Our 	 journey 	 to 	 becoming 	 a 	 truly 	 resilient, all–weather franchise has  been 	 powered 	 by 	 consistent 	 execution, 	 and strategic investments in talent,  technology, 	 and 	 scalable 	 initiatives. 	 We’ve not only exceeded our GPS  commitments but also unlocked new  levers 	 of 	 competitive 	 advantage. We delivered market–leading growth  across 	 our 	 identified 	 focus 	 segments, 	 while 	 maintaining 	 tight 	 control 	 over 	 costs. 	 Our 	 deposit 	 franchise 	 continues 	 to strengthen in both quality and  granularity, 	 reflected 	 in 	 a 	 340 	 bps 	 improvement 	 in 	 outflow 	 ratio 	 over 	 the 	 past three years, now similar to larger  private peer banks.  Our 	 customer–first 	 mindset 	 is 	 driving 	 deeper 	 engagement 	 and 	 premiumisation 	 across 	 the 	 board. 	 From 	 curated 	 offerings 	 to 	 award–winning 	 wealth 	 platforms, 	 we 	 are 	 creating 	 differentiated 	 experiences that resonate with every segment we  serve. This has not only helped in exceeding our GPS  commitments but also in unlocking new levers of  competitive 	 advantage. Despite a challenging liquidity  environment, we have demonstrated  controlled increase in cost of funds  over the last eight quarters, with only 7  bps increase in the last four quarters, a  testament to our disciplined approach  and 	 robust 	 acquisition 	 engine. 	   Our expansion strategy, product  innovation, 	 and 	 momentum 	 in 	 salary 	 credits are beginning to show early  signs 	 of 	 traction 	 on 	 the 	 deposit 	 base. Balancing Growth Ambition with Cost  Prudence In a deposit–constrained environment  which 	 lasted 	 mostly 	 through 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 we 	 prioritised 	 businesses 	 with 	 high 	 RAROC 	 opportunities. 	 Our 	 Small Business Banking, SME, and  Mid–Corporate 	 portfolios 	 grew 	 14% 	 y–o–y, 	 now 	 accounting 	 for 	 ~23% 	 of 	 the total loan book, up ~740 bps over  the past four years, a clear indicator  of 	 our 	 strategic 	 shift 	 towards 	 more 	 profitable 	 growth. Our cost performance was driven  by three key factors: conscious  belt 	 tightening, 	 the 	 phasing 	 out 	 of 	 integration-related 	 expenses, 	 and 	 a 	 contribution 	 from 	 volume. 	 While 	 the 	 volume-related 	 benefits 	 may 	 diminish 	 as 	 we 	 get 	 the 	 right 	 set 	 of 	 liabilities, 	 the 	 focus 	 on 	 belt 	 tightening 	 and 	 ongoing 	 optimisation 	 initiatives 	 will 	 persist. 	 Operating 	 expenses 	 for 	 fiscal 	 2025 	 grew 	 just 	 6% 	 y–o–y, 	 a 	 sharp 	 moderation 	 from 	 30% 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2024. 	 Remarkably, 	 despite opening a record 500 new  branches, 	 staff 	 costs 	 rose 	 by 	 12%, 	 with 	 a 	 net 	 addition 	 of 	 just 	 121 	 employees— driven 	 by 	 digitisation 	 and 	 productivity 	 gains in certain areas. Deepening customer engagement with  premiumisation gaining ground Our salaried customer franchise  continues 	 to 	 deepen, 	 with 	 18% 	 y–o–y 	 growth in salary uploads and a 38%  y–o–y 	 surge 	 in 	 premium 	 acquisitions 	 in 	 the NTB Salary segment by March 31,  2025. 	 This 	 reflects 	 the 	 success 	 of 	 our 	 targeted engagement strategies and  product 	 personalisation. The 	 premiumisation 	 of 	 our 	 franchise 	 is 	 progressing well. Burgundy AUMs grew  10% y–o–y, and our Burgundy Private  segment was recognised as India’s Best  for Next Gen at the Euromoney Global  Private Banking Awards 2025.  We 	 also 	 launched 	 differentiated 	 offerings 	 like 	 the 	 ‘ARISE’ 	 savings 	 account 	 for women and the Doctors Banking  Program, reinforcing our commitment    to delivering curated experiences for  every customer segment. 71 

In the retail unsecured segment,  including 	 microfinance, 	 we 	 are 	 witnessing 	 a 	 normalisation 	 cycle 	 driven 	 by 	 increased 	 credit 	 appetite 	 and 	 over– leverage in certain cohorts. We have  proactively 	 responded 	 with 	 tighter 	 portfolio 	 monitoring, 	 early 	 warning 	 triggers, 	 and 	 recalibrated 	 underwriting 	 policies to ensure delinquencies  remain within acceptable thresholds.  These 	 timely 	 interventions 	 reflect 	 our commitment to maintaining asset  quality 	 while 	 supporting 	 responsible 	 credit growth. Our 	 provisioning 	 and 	 recognition 	 standards remain among the most  conservative 	 in 	 the 	 industry. 	 In 	 Q4 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 we 	 further 	 tightened 	 our 	 classification 	 and 	 upgrade 	 criteria 	 for 	 select loan categories. There is no  economic 	 loss 	 due 	 to 	 this 	 conservative 	 stance, but this may marginally impact  credit 	 costs 	 and 	 recoveries 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2026 	 over 	 fiscal 	 2025. 	 It 	 reinforces 	 our 	 long–term focus on transparency and  balance sheet resilience. Our 	 CET–1 	 ratio, 	 including 	 profits, 	 stands at 14.67%, up 93 basis points  y–o–y, 	 even 	 after 	 accounting 	 for 	 the 	 proposed 	 dividend 	 of 	 ₹1 	 per 	 share– driven largely by strong internal  accruals. This capital strength gives us  the 	 confidence 	 and 	 flexibility 	 to 	 invest 	 in future growth while staying well  above regulatory thresholds. Business performance review Driving Scale and Sophistication in  Wholesale Banking On the Wholesale Banking front, our  industry–leading  neo 	 platforms 	 and 	 bespoke 	 solutions 	 in 	 payments 	 and 	 cash 	 management 	 continue 	 to 	 drive 	 higher 	 transaction 	 flows 	 and 	 stronger 	 current account balances. We further  solidified 	 our 	 position 	 with 	 ~23% 	 market share in IMPS, ~30% in NEFT  for March 2025, 7% in GST Payments  and 	 11% 	 in 	 foreign 	 LC 	 for 	 fiscal 	 2025. 	 In the Merchant Acquiring Business, we  retained 	 our 	 stature 	 as 	 a 	 top–tier 	 player 	 with a 20% terminal market share for  March 2025. Fortifying Our Foundation:   A Stronger Balance Sheet and   Capital Position Our 	 balance 	 sheet 	 continues 	 to 	 be 	 a pillar of strength, underpinned by  robust capital adequacy and best  in class asset quality metrics. We  maintained a PCR of 75%, further  complemented by non–NPA provisions  of 	 ₹11,957 	 crores, 	 resulting 	 in 	 a 	 standard 	 asset 	 coverage 	 ratio 	 of 	 1.15% 	 as on March 31, 2025. Our 	 net 	 NPA 	 stands 	 at 	 just 	 0.33%, 	 the lowest among large peer banks,  an outcome of our prudent and  conservative 	 provisioning 	 practices. Strengthening the Core:  Technology, Security, and Scale We 	 continued 	 to 	 invest 	 in 	 building 	 a 	 future–ready technology architecture  and 	 enhancing 	 capabilities 	 across 	 cyber security, fraud control, risk, and  collections. 	 These 	 investments 	 are 	 enabling us to replace fragmented  legacy systems with scalable, integrated  platforms 	 that 	 support 	 innovation 	 and 	 business growth. Our 	 digital 	 platforms 	 are 	 a 	 testament 	 to 	 this 	 transformation. 	 neo  for Corporates  and Integrated Treasury Management  are 	 now 	 live, 	 offering 	 seamless 	 digital 	 experiences to large enterprises.  neo  for  Business, 	 our 	 MSME–focused 	 platform, 	 now serves 1.8 lakh customers, while  neo  for Corporates has been extended  to over 2 lakh clients. We also launched the UPI–ATM, an  Android–based cash recycler that  enables cardless cash withdrawals  and 	 deposits 	 via 	 UPI—an 	 industry– first 	 innovation. 	 In 	 partnership 	 with 	 NPCI’s Bharat BillPay Limited (NBBL),  we introduced Bharat Connect for  Business, 	 a 	 comprehensive 	 solution 	 for managing working capital and  streamlining receivables and payables.  Our Financial Crime Intelligence  division now integrates advanced  analytics, 	 digital 	 monitoring, 	 and 	 fraud 	 control, 	 significantly 	 enhancing 	 our 	 security posture in an increasingly  digital world. We 	 continue 	 to 	 garner 	 several 	 key 	 external 	 recognitions 	 for 	 the 	 capabilities 	 and 	 initiatives 	 we 	 have 	 undertaken successfully in the last  few years as the Bank was featured  on TIME’s World Best Companies  2024, ranking highest among Indian  financial 	 peers. 	 We 	 received 	 multiple 	 accolades at the ICC Emerging Asia  Banking 	 Awards 	 for 	 profitability, 	 risk 	 management, asset quality, and ESG  We 	 are 	 laying 	 the 	 foundation 	 for 	 a 	 future–ready 	   bank–one that is secure, scalable, and built to innovate.  Our 	 investments 	 in 	 integrated 	 platforms 	 and 	 digital 	 infrastructure are enabling us to serve customers with  greater 	 speed, 	 intelligence, 	 and 	 personalisation.

MD & CEO’s statement practices. 	 The 	 Axis 	 Bank 	 Foundation 	 won gold at FICCI’s Sustainable  Agriculture Summit 2024, and we were  named Best Indian Bank at the FT Bank  of 	 the 	 Year 	 2024 	 Awards–a 	 reflection 	 of our winning mindset culture  percolating 	 across 	 the 	 Bank. Creating multiplicative forces to  build competitive advantage At Axis Bank, we believe that true  competitive 	 advantage 	 is 	 built 	 not 	 just 	 through scale, but through synergy. Our  ability 	 to 	 integrate 	 capabilities 	 across 	 businesses, 	 platforms, 	 and 	 partnerships 	 has 	 created 	 powerful 	 multiplicative 	 forces 	 that 	 position 	 us 	 to 	 lead 	 India’s 	 evolving 	 financial 	 landscape 	 over 	 the 	 next decade. Our ‘One Axis’ strategy is a prime  example of this. The seamless  integration 	 of 	 the 	 erstwhile 	 Citi 	 consumer business was completed in  July 2024, well ahead of the schedule,  thus 	 showcasing 	 our 	 execution 	 strength 	 and 	 digital 	 readiness. 	 Former 	 Citibank 	 customers 	 have 	 now 	 fully 	 transitioned 	 to 	 Axis 	 platforms, 	 including 	 the 	 ‘open’   by Axis mobile app and internet  banking. 	 Not 	 only 	 was 	 the 	 migration 	 smooth, 	 but 	 digital 	 engagement 	 for 	 Citi 	 customers 	 has 	 also 	 surged—monthly 	 active 	 users 	 and 	 transaction 	 volumes 	 have 	 exceeded 	 pre–integration 	 levels, 	 reflecting 	 the 	 strength 	 of 	 our 	 digital ecosystem. Together with our partners, we’re not  just building products—we’re building  ecosystems that shape the future of  banking. Our commitment to inclusive  innovation 	 is 	 equally 	 strong. 	   Recently, 	 we 	 launched 	 an 	 industry–first 	 UPI 	 solution 	 tailored 	 for 	 senior 	 citizens, 	 addressing 	 a 	 critical 	 gap 	 in 	 digital 	 accessibility. We also partnered with  the 	 International 	 Finance 	 Corporation 	 (IFC) to secure a $500 million loan,  India’s 	 first–ever 	 blue 	 loan, 	 to 	 scale 	 up 	 green 	 and 	 sustainable 	 financing 	 towards water and wastewater  management, 	 reduction 	 of 	 marine 	 plastic 	 pollution, 	 restoration 	 of 	 marine 	 ecosystems, sustainable shipping,  eco-friendly 	 tourism, 	 and 	 offshore 	 renewable energy. This landmark  partnership underscores our leadership  in responsible banking. We are also deepening our support  for India’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.  Our 	 collaboration 	 with 	 a 	 fintech 	 company is helping empower SMEs  with 	 digital 	 tools 	 and 	 financial 	 solutions. 	 Meanwhile, Axis Bank has emerged as  the leading UPI Payer PSP Bank in India,  commanding a ~33% market share  by both value and volume for March  2025. This leadership is powered by our  partnerships with 15 third–party app  providers and a robust UPI presence  across Axis Mobile, BHIM Axis Pay,  and Freecharge. The strength of ‘One Axis’ lies in the  seamless collaboration between the  Bank and its subsidiaries—each adding  depth, agility, and innovation to our  collective journey. Our 	 subsidiaries 	 continue 	 to 	 be 	 the 	 strong 	 engines 	 of 	 value 	 creation. 	   In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 our 	 domestic 	 subsidiaries 	 delivered 	 a 	 net 	 profit 	 of 	 ₹1,768 	 crores, 	 growing 11% y–o–y, with a 46% return  on investment. Axis Finance grew its  AUM by 22%, with a 14.51% ROE and  a 	 capital 	 adequacy 	 ratio 	 of 	 20.9%. 	 Axis 	 AMC posted a 21% y–o–y PAT growth  to 	 ₹501 	 crores, 	 while 	 Axis 	 Securities 	 delivered 	 39% 	 PAT 	 growth 	 to 	 ₹419 	 crores. Axis Capital maintained its  leadership in equity capital markets,  and Invoicemart has now facilitated  over 	 ₹1.8 	 lakh 	 crores 	 in 	 MSME 	 invoice 	 financing 	 since 	 inception. 	 Max Life Insurance has been  rebranded as Axis Max Life Insurance  after 	 receiving 	 the 	 corporate 	 and 	 regulatory approval. We believe that  the 	 integration 	 of 	 two 	 trusted 	 names, 	 Max 	 Life 	 and 	 Axis 	 in 	 the 	 financial 	 services sector, will empower Axis Max  Life to achieve its long–term growth  aspirations 	 through 	 strategic 	 expansion 	 beyond 	 metros 	 and 	 tier 	 1 	 cities. 	 Being 	 India’s fourth–largest life insurer,  Axis 	 Max 	 Life 	 Insurance 	 continues 	 to be among the fastest–growing in  the sector. Together, 	 these 	 efforts 	 reflect 	 the 	 power 	 of 	 ‘One 	 Axis’ 	 as 	 we 	 continue 	 to enhance our ability to create  exponential 	 value 	 by 	 connecting 	 the 	 dots across our ecosystem: customers,  platforms, 	 partners, 	 and 	 subsidiaries. 	 At 	 Axis 	 Bank, 	 we 	 believe 	 true 	 competitive 	 advantage 	 is 	 not 	 just 	 built 	 through 	 scale, 	 but 	 through 	 synergy.

Economic Environment The slowdown in India’s economic  growth 	 during 	 fiscal 	 2025 	 was 	 primarily 	 due 	 to 	 unintended 	 fiscal 	 and 	 monetary 	 tightening. 	   Two 	 main 	 fiscal 	 challenges 	 emerged: 	 the 	 union 	 government’s 	 fiscal 	 deficit 	 decreased by 80 basis points of  GDP 	 in 	 both 	 fiscal 	 2024 	 and 	 fiscal 	 2025. 	 Additionally, 	 while 	 spending 	 was 	 front–loaded 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2024, 	 it 	 was 	 backloaded 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2025 	 due 	 to 	 general 	 elections, 	 leading 	 to 	 a 	 prolonged 	 lull 	 in 	 government 	 activity. 	 Fortunately, these challenges are  now 	 easing, 	 with 	 the 	 deficit 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2026 expected to decrease by only  40 basis points of GDP as spending  patterns 	 stabilise. 	 On 	 the 	 monetary 	 side, 	 after 	 accounting 	 for 	 a 	 significant 	 merger 	 in 	 the 	 banking 	 sector 	 during 	 fiscal 	 2024, non–food credit growth  declined from 16.3% in March 2024  to 10.9% y–o–y in March 2025. This  considerable drop was widespread,  not limited to the unsecured loans  segment, and was primarily driven by  supply factors. It was prompted by  regulatory concerns over high loan– to–deposit 	 ratios 	 (LDR) 	 at 	 certain 	 banks. Consequently,  as banks reduced credit growth,  they also slowed down deposit  creation, 	 exacerbating 	 the 	 weak 	 liquidity 	 injections 	 from 	 the 	 RBI. 	 Moreover, the central bank’s foreign  exchange 	 interventions 	   ($ sales) resulted in a liquidity drain  of about  D 5 lakh crores, further  increasing liquidity stress. However, 	 actions 	 taken 	 by 	 the 	 RBI, 	 such 	 as 	 cutting 	 the 	 cash 	 reserve 	 ratio 	 (CRR), 	 injecting 	 durable 	 liquidity 	 through bond purchases and  buy–sell foreign exchange swaps,  reducing repo rates, rolling back risk  weights on lending to non–banking  financial 	 companies 	 (NBFCs) 	 and 	 microfinance 	 institutions 	 (MFIs), 	 and 	 implementing 	 looser 	 liquidity 	 coverage 	 ratio 	 (LCR) 	 regulations, 	 have fostered a more favourable  environment for growth. With  inflation 	 now 	 falling 	 below 	 4%, 	   the 	 policy 	 focus 	 has 	 shifted 	 firmly 	 to 	 stimulating 	 growth. 	 The 	 banking 	 system remains well–capitalised  to support a growing economy,  showing 	 early 	 indications 	 of 	 a 	 rebound in private investments,  while credit risks appear to be  under control. Business performance review We remain agile and  responsive to the risks  posed by a challenging  global environment while  also capitalising on the  opportunities presented by  a strong and resilient Indian  economy. We have raised  our compliance thresholds  to ensure the best interests  of our stakeholders and  customers, even as we aim  for industry–beating growth.

External environment Global Economic Outlook The global economic system that  has 	 functioned 	 since 	 World 	 War 	 II 	 is now undergoing a reset.    The 	 Trump 	 administration 	 views 	 its 	 political 	 role 	 as 	 addressing 	 the 	 significant 	 rise 	 in 	 income 	 and wealth inequality in the US,  the decline of its manufacturing  sector, and what it considers to  be 	 the 	 misuse 	 of 	 the 	 multilateral 	 institutions 	 it 	 has 	 supported 	 for 	 the last 80 years. Consequently,  it 	 has 	 initiated 	 structural 	 changes 	 in areas such as trade, taxes,  regulations, 	 immigration, 	 currency, 	 and energy markets, among others.  Negotiations 	 around 	 these 	 issues 	 and the development of new  engagement models are expected  to 	 be 	 contentious, 	 potentially 	 resulting 	 in 	 an 	 extended 	 policy 	 vacuum. The only limit on the  speed 	 of 	 this 	 transition 	 appears 	 to 	 be 	 market 	 volatility. 	 When uncertainty reaches a  certain threshold, markets can  become 	 chaotic. 	 Fear 	 of 	 such 	 chaos has led to a retreat from  excessively 	 disruptive 	 actions 	 on several occasions. Despite  some 	 tariff 	 rollbacks 	 and 	 ongoing 	 discussions to further reduce them,  the prevailing uncertainty is likely to  hinder global growth as:   » Investment decisions will be  deferred 	 until 	 there 	 is 	 more 	 clarity 	 regarding 	 tariffs 	 and 	 exchange rates.    » Higher 	 tariffs 	 result 	 in 	 fiscal 	 tightening, 	 among 	 other 	 factors, which will lead to  reduced 	 consumption. 	   » Financial 	 conditions 	 will 	 tighten 	 due to uncertainty. Relevant Risks Business Risk Credit Risk Liquidity Risk Market Risk Opportunities Identified  The Indian economy is expected  to maintain strong growth despite  challenges from abroad. It is among  the 	 least 	 affected 	 globally, 	 with 	 minimal 	 direct 	 impacts 	 from 	 initial 	 US 	 tariffs. 	 There 	 is 	 also 	 potential 	 for 	 shared gains due to the increasing  momentum of the ‘China + 1’ trend.  Enhancements 	 in 	 competitive 	 areas, such as infrastructure and  the electronics value chain, are  anticipated 	 to 	 contribute 	 positively. 	 India’s service exports, especially  from global capability centres, remain  strong. The underlying factors driving  this 	 include 	 the 	 disaggregation 	 of 	 global service value chains, a rapid  boost in global cross–border telecom  capacity, and a rise in remote working,  all 	 of 	 which 	 are 	 expected 	 to 	 continue. 	 The 	 recovery 	 in 	 the 	 domestic 	 real estate market, along with the  alleviation 	 of 	 various 	 challenges 	 that 	 hindered economic growth last year,  is likely to bolster credit demand.  With 	 improving 	 liquidity 	 conditions 	 and 	 the 	 implementation 	 of 	 rate 	 cuts, 	 credit growth should rise from its  current 	 state. 	 However, 	 the 	 significant 	 uncertainty from US trade policies  and 	 fluctuations 	 in 	 financial 	 markets 	 may delay corporate investments and  weaken their demand for loans. Our Strategic Response The Bank navigates the global economic reset with a calibrated strategy that balances prudence and  opportunity. 	 As 	 uncertainties 	 around 	 trade, 	 tariffs, 	 and 	 capital 	 flows 	 persist, 	 we 	 are 	 strengthening 	 our 	 risk 	 management 	 systems 	 to 	 address 	 liquidity, 	 market, 	 and 	 credit 	 risks. 	 At 	 the 	 same 	 time, 	 we 	 are 	 capitalising 	 on 	 India’s 	 relative 	 insulation 	 from 	 global 	 disruptions 	 by 	 deepening 	 support 	 for 	 sectors 	 aligned 	 with 	 the 	   ‘China + 1’ strategy, such as infrastructure, electronics, and services exports. Our focused lending to global  capability 	 centres, 	 SMEs, 	 and 	 real 	 estate 	 segments 	 allows 	 us 	 to 	 capture 	 the 	 revival 	 of 	 domestic 	 demand. 	 We 	 are 	 also 	 enhancing 	 agility 	 through 	 diversified 	 credit 	 portfolios 	 and 	 dynamic 	 liquidity 	 management. 77

In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 the 	 imperative 	 to 	 build climate resilience and embed  ESG principles into core business  strategies gained unprecedented  momentum. Globally, regulatory  focus on climate–related  financial 	 risks 	 intensified, 	 with 	 the 	 Basel 	 Committee 	 on 	 Banking 	 Supervision (BCBS) advancing  efforts 	 to 	 integrate 	 climate 	 risks 	 into 	 prudential 	 standards. 	 In India, the government’s  ‘Amrit Kaal’ vision catalysed  transformative 	 investments 	 in renewable energy, digital  innovation, 	 and 	 sustainable 	 infrastructure, reinforcing the  country’s leadership in green  development. Regulatory  momentum 	 continued 	 to 	 build, 	 such 	 as 	 SEBI 	 mandating 	 reasonable 	 assurance on select BRSR Core  KPIs to enhance the credibility of  sustainability 	 reporting. 	 At 	 the 	 same 	 time, 	 the 	 RBI 	 introduced 	 its 	 final 	 framework 	 for 	 Climate–related 	 Financial Disclosures, laying the  groundwork 	 for 	 a 	 more 	 systematic 	 approach to managing climate risks  within 	 the 	 financial 	 sector. 	 Our 	 key 	 priorities 	 include 	 implementing 	 climate 	 risk 	 stress 	 testing 	 frameworks, 	 enhancing transparency through  robust ESG disclosures, and scaling  financing 	 solutions 	 supporting 	 positive 	 environmental and social outcomes. Impact of Climate    Risk–related aspects on  Credit Risk Relevant Risks Operational 	 Risk Our Strategic Response The 	 Bank 	 is 	 capitalising 	 on 	 sustainable 	 finance 	 by 	 expanding 	 its 	 portfolio 	 in 	 ESG-aligned 	 sectors 	 and 	 activities, 	 actively 	 raising 	 green 	 capital 	 and 	 piloting 	 new 	 green 	 initiatives 	 in 	 both 	 retail 	 and 	 wholesale 	 banking.

The Banking, Financial Services,  and Insurance (BFSI) sector  encountered 	 significant 	 competition 	 for specialised talent in technology,  risk and compliance, environmental,  social, and governance (ESG) factors,  cyber 	 security, 	 and 	 data 	 analytics. 	 Organisations 	 responded 	 by 	 expanding 	 their digital learning ecosystems,  integrating 	 artificial 	 intelligence 	 and 	 future skills into employee development  initiatives, 	 enhancing 	 internal 	 mobility 	 programs, 	 and 	 making 	 substantial 	 investments in frontline leadership  development. 	 Initiatives 	 designed 	 to 	 promote mental health, workplace  resilience, diversity, equity, and inclusion  (DE&I) 	 were 	 prioritised 	 as 	 essential 	 pillars 	 of 	 organisational 	 strategy. 	 Our Strategic Response At 	 Axis 	 Bank, 	 we 	 are 	 committed 	 to 	 shaping 	 the 	 future 	 of 	 work 	 through 	 innovation, 	 inclusion, 	 and 	 agility. 	   By 	 leveraging 	 AI–powered 	 tools 	 across 	 the 	 employee 	 lifecycle, 	 from 	 talent 	 acquisition 	 and 	 assessments 	 to 	   HR 	 query 	 resolution 	 and 	 employee 	 listening, 	 we 	 are 	 enhancing 	 decision–making, 	 reducing 	 turnaround 	 time, 	 and 	 improving employee experience at scale. Internal 	 career 	 growth 	 is 	 a 	 key 	 pillar 	 of 	 our 	 talent 	 strategy. 	 Platforms 	 like 	 Catalyst 	 under 	 the 	 ‘Thrive’ 	 program 	 have 	 fortified 	 our 	 mobility 	 framework, 	 resulting 	 in 	 increased 	 internal 	 movements 	 and 	 cross–functional 	 transitions. 	 Coupled with leadership development programs such as 1000 Change Leaders, High–performing Leaders, and  BetterUp 	 Coaching, 	 we 	 are 	 nurturing 	 a 	 pipeline 	 of 	 future–ready 	 leaders. Our 	 flexible 	 work 	 model, 	 including 	 GIG–A 	 Opportunities 	 and 	 hybrid 	 schedules, 	 empowers 	 remote 	 associates 	 and 	 freelancers 	 to 	 join 	 the 	 workforce 	 and 	 contribute. 	 Through 	 these 	 initiatives, 	 we 	 have 	 broadened 	 our 	 talent 	 reach, 	 enhanced 	 diversity, 	 and 	 supported 	 work–life 	 balance 	 without 	 compromising 	 on 	 productivity. We 	 have 	 also 	 reimagined 	 learning 	 through 	 role–based, 	 digital–first 	 platforms 	 that 	 focus 	 on 	 future 	 skills 	 in 	 areas 	 such 	 as 	 ESG 	 finance, 	 compliance, 	 and 	 digital 	 banking, 	 delivered 	 through 	 a 	 unified 	 HCM 	 suite 	 across 	 all subsidiaries. By 	 combining 	 advanced 	 technology 	 with 	 inclusive 	 and 	 human–centric 	 practices, 	 Axis 	 Bank 	 is 	 building 	 a 	 resilient, 	 future–ready workforce equipped to lead through change and deliver sustained value.

Business performance review Regulatory and Policy Landscape Opportunities Identified    » Lead responsible digital  innovation 	 by 	 embedding 	 compliance–by–design  across products, services,  and 	 operations.   » Strengthen investor and  stakeholder trust through  transparent, high–quality ESG  and cyber security disclosures. In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 the 	 regulatory 	 and 	 policy landscape for the banking  sector 	 underwent 	 substantial 	 evolution, 	 reflecting 	 an 	 intensified 	 focus 	 on 	 financial 	 stability, 	 digital 	 innovation, 	 climate 	 resilience, 	 and 	 consumer 	 protection. 	 The 	 Reserve 	 Bank of India (RBI) introduced key  measures, including enhanced  cyber security, outsourcing of  IT services, and IT governance  risk, controls, and assurance  guidelines. 	 The 	 RBI 	 also 	 finalised 	 the framework for climate–related  financial 	 disclosures, 	 tightened 	 macroprudential 	 norms 	 around 	 unsecured lending, and reinforced  liquidity management standards  to 	 mitigate 	 emerging 	 systemic 	 risks. In early 2025, the Ministry  of 	 Electronics 	 and 	 Information 	 Technology (MeitY) released  the 	 Draft 	 Digital 	 Personal 	 Data 	 Protection 	 (DPDP) 	 Rules, 	 2025, 	 for 	 public 	 consultation. 	 These 	 rules 	 are intended to provide detailed  guidelines 	 for 	 implementing 	 the 	 DPDP 	 Act, 	 covering 	 data 	 fiduciary 	 obligations, 	 consent 	 mechanisms, 	 data 	 principal rights, and establishing the  Data 	 Protection 	 Board 	 of 	 India. 	 In 	 parallel, 	 the 	 Securities 	 and 	 Exchange 	 Board 	 of 	 India 	 (SEBI) 	 operationalised 	 reasonable assurance requirements  for select Business Responsibility  and Sustainability Report (BRSR)  Core metrics for the top 150 listed  entities, 	 significantly 	 strengthening 	 the 	 credibility of corporate sustainability  disclosures. 	 Internationally, 	 regulatory 	 momentum on AI governance,  sustainable 	 finance, 	 and 	 digital 	 assets 	 continued 	 to 	 influence 	 policy 	 thinking in India, reinforcing the  need for integrated risk management  and 	 responsible 	 innovation 	 across 	 the sector. Our Strategic Response The 	 Bank 	 employs 	 a 	 compliance–by–design 	 approach 	 across 	 its 	 products, 	 services, 	 and 	 operations 	 to 	 lead 	 in 	 responsible 	 digital 	 innovation. 	 By 	 integrating 	 regulatory 	 requirements, 	 the 	 bank 	 guarantees 	 that 	 its 	 new 	 offerings 	 in 	 digital 	 banking, 	 artificial 	 intelligence, 	 payment 	 solutions, 	 and 	 open 	 banking 	 are 	 developed 	 with 	 strong 	 security, 	 privacy, 	 and 	 governance 	 frameworks. 	 At 	 the 	 same 	 time, 	 the 	 Bank 	 is 	 building 	 investor 	 and 	 stakeholder trust by enhancing the quality and transparency of its environmental, social, and governance  (ESG) 	 and 	 cyber 	 security 	 disclosures. 	 This 	 includes 	 proactive 	 alignment 	 with 	 the 	 SEBI’s 	 updated 	 BRSR 	 assurance norms, the RBI’s new Outsourcing of IT Services and IT Governance Risk, Control, and Assurance  guidelines, 	 and 	 global 	 best 	 practices 	 in 	 climate 	 and 	 data 	 reporting.

External environment Making a Positive Change in Society Opportunities Identified    » Expand 	 financial 	 services 	 access by tapping into  rural, semi–urban, and  underbanked markets.   » Promote inclusive growth by  providing targeted support to  women entrepreneurs, small  businesses, and community  development 	 initiatives.   » Strengthen brand trust and  loyalty by aligning with societal  expectations 	 of 	 sustainability, 	 diversity, equity, and inclusion. In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 India’s 	 social 	 landscape was shaped by  accelerated 	 digital 	 adoption, 	 rising 	 aspirations 	 across 	 rural 	 and semi–urban markets, and  a 	 heightened 	 focus 	 on 	 financial 	 inclusion, 	 education, 	 healthcare, 	 and sustainability. The rapid  expansion 	 of 	 mobile 	 connectivity, 	 digital payment ecosystems, and  government–led social welfare  programs 	 continued 	 to 	 drive 	 broader economic empowerment,  particularly 	 among 	 underserved 	 communities. 	 Concurrently, 	 societal 	 expectations 	 regarding 	 corporate responsibility,  community engagement, and  advancing diversity, equity, and  inclusion 	 (DE&I) 	 intensified, 	 influencing 	 how 	 businesses 	 engage 	 with stakeholders and contribute  to social development. Against 	 this 	 backdrop, 	 the 	 financial 	 services sector fosters inclusive  growth. 	 Institutions 	 are 	 expanding 	 their reach into Bharat markets,  empowering small businesses and  rural 	 entrepreneurs, 	 promoting 	 digital 	 financial 	 literacy, 	 and 	 designing 	 products tailored to underserved  segments. In parallel, industry–led  initiatives 	 focused 	 on 	 livelihood 	 generation, 	 women’s 	 empowerment, 	 education, 	 healthcare 	 access, 	 and sustainable development are  becoming central to corporate  citizenship 	 strategies. Our Strategic Response The Bank strategically enhances its presence across the Bharat markets through its dedicated Bharat  Banking 	 franchise, 	 which 	 offers 	 customised 	 financial 	 solutions 	 for 	 rural 	 and 	 semi–urban 	 customers. 	   We persist in empowering women entrepreneurs and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) by  augmenting 	 access 	 to 	 affordable 	 credit, 	 skill 	 development, 	 and 	 financial 	 literacy 	 initiatives. 	 We 	 implement 	 expansive 	 livelihood, 	 education, 	 and 	 healthcare 	 programs 	 aligned 	 with 	 national 	 development 	 priorities 	 under 	 our 	 CSR 	 focus. 	 Moreover, 	 by 	 profoundly 	 integrating 	 sustainability, 	 diversity, 	 and 	 community 	 engagement 	 into 	 our 	 corporate 	 ethos, 	 we 	 strengthen 	 stakeholder 	 trust 	 and 	 cultivate 	 a 	 socially 	 responsible, 	 future–ready 	 institution.

Business performance review STRATEGY IN ACTION Strengthening our   House of GPS Rooted in our core  philosophy of Growth,  Profitability and  Sustainability, the House  of GPS has evolved into a  powerful engine that drives  us forward. In fiscal 2025,  we continued to enrich  this strategic framework,  enabling us to deliver    with distinctiveness    while strengthening our  digital leadership and    execution excellence. In 2019, we launched our ‘Growth  Profitability 	 and 	 Sustainability’ 	 strategy, also known as the    ‘House of GPS’, to provide a  unifying framework to our  versatile 	 team, 	 who 	 serve 	 as 	 a cornerstone of our strength  and adaptability.    The overall strategy of the Bank  and 	 that 	 of 	 its 	 specific 	 businesses 	 and 	 functions 	 are 	 aligned 	 with 	 our core philosophy – Growth,  Profitability, 	 and 	 Sustainability. 	 As part of our annual review of the  House of GPS in 2021, we added  two 	 elements 	 of 	 distinctiveness 	 – ‘Sparsh’ (Deliver world–class  customer experience) and ‘Bharat’  (Build 	 India’s 	 most 	 profitable 	 Bharat banking franchise),  with an overarching focus on  ‘Digital’ (Leadership in digital and  technology). Then, in 2023 we bolstered our  Sustainability pillar by including  four key themes for the Bank –  ‘Deposit 	 Mobilisation’, 	 ‘People 	 Proposition’, 	 ‘Operational 	 Risk 	 & 	 Compliance Culture’, and    ‘Execution 	 Excellence’. 	 In 2024, we added ‘Leveraging  Emerging Technologies’, which  includes 	 Generative 	 AI 	 and 	 Intelligent 	 Automation, 	 as 	 one 	 of 	 the 	 key 	 enablers for the Bank.  To 	 build 	 on 	 the 	 ‘Execution 	 Excellence’ 	 theme as part of the Sustainability  pillar, the Bank has set up a dedicated  project 	 management 	 team 	 that 	 has started deploying appropriate  execution 	 frameworks 	 to 	 improve 	   the 	 pace 	 and 	 efficiency 	   of 	 project 	 execution. The House of GPS, as it stands today,  continues 	 to 	 reflect 	 our 	 aspirations 	 and remains relevant. We have a  responsibility to propel our business  towards 	 success 	 by 	 prioritising 	 the 	 GPS strategy and the key themes,    as well as focusing on our values.

Dear Shareholders, Fiscal 2025 has been a year marked  by 	 strategic 	 discipline 	 and 	 thoughtful 	 navigation 	 through 	 a 	 complex 	 operating 	 environment. 	 Amidst 	 a 	 backdrop of subdued systemic deposit  growth and emerging challenges in  select areas of the retail unsecured  segment, we remained focused  on improving deposit quality and  portfolio 	 resilience 	 driving 	 long–term 	 value 	 creation. 	 Our 	 Retail 	 Banking 	 business 	 continues 	 to anchor our GPS strategy, delivering  balanced, 	 risk–adjusted 	 growth. 	 We 	 have taken deliberate steps toward  building a high–quality, premium  Retail 	 Banking 	 franchise—defined 	 by an improved deposit base, strong  progress in our wealth management  business, and the prudent expansion  of 	 our 	 loan 	 portfolio. 	 This 	 segment 	 remains a key engine of our growth,  driven 	 by 	 a 	 sharp 	 customer–first 	 mindset, 	 a 	 suite 	 of 	 innovative 	 and 	 differentiated 	 products, 	 and 	 one 	 of 	 the 	 most 	 extensive 	 distribution 	 networks 	 in the country having 5,876 branches  with a record 500 branches opened  in 	 fiscal 	 2025. 	 These 	 pillars 	 empower 	 us 	 to 	 meet 	 the 	 evolving 	 financial 	 aspirations 	 of 	 millions 	 across 	 India. The quality of our deposit franchise  is 	 getting 	 stronger 	 with 	 further 	 granularisation 	 and 	 we 	 continue 	 to 	 witness sustained growth across our  priority business segments like SBB  and Rural Banking. We’ve maintained  dominant 	 position 	 in 	 cards, 	 payments, 	 and wealth management, while  adopting 	 a 	 calibrated 	 growth 	 approach 	 in the unsecured retail segment. On  the 	 digital 	 payment 	 front, 	 we 	 continue 	 to 	 lead 	 with 	 distinction 	 holding 	 a 	 dominant 	 position 	 in 	 the 	 UPI 	 Payer 	 PSP space and credit cards. Customer 	 satisfaction 	 continues 	 to be our true north. Through  our forward–looking Customer  Experience 	 program, 	 we’re 	 creating 	 ‘wow’ 	 moments 	 at 	 every 	 touchpoint— empowering our employees to deliver  truly 	 memorable 	 interaction 	 for 	 our 	 customers. This has translated into  stronger customer engagement,  deeper loyalty, and growing advocacy.  Our sharp focus on experience has  MESSAGE 	 FROM 	 THE 	 MANAGEMENT 	 – 	 RETAIL 	 BANKING Delivering sustainable and  profitable growth Business performance review Munish Sharda Executive 	 Director 	   (Retail 	 Liabilities, 	 Branch 	 Banking, 	 Bharat Banking, Commercial  Banking Group, and Retail  Portfolio 	 Management 	 Group) Arjun Chowdhry Group 	 Executive 	   (Affluent 	 Banking, 	 Retail Lending, Cards &  Payments) Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 92 

Our deposit franchise  is being reimagined on  the pillars of quality,  cost, 	 and 	 growth— creating 	 a 	 stronger, 	 smarter 	 foundation 	 for sustainable  value 	 creation. Message from the management – Retail banking propelled 	 a 	 significant 	 improvement 	 in 	 our Retail Net Promoter Score (NPS).  The 	 seamless 	 integration 	 of 	 the 	 Citi 	 consumer 	 businesses 	 has 	 positioned 	 us across the spectrum, turbocharging  our 	 journey 	 towards 	 becoming 	 a 	 premium retail banking powerhouse. Reimagining Deposits: Building a  Stronger, Smarter Franchise At 	 Axis 	 Bank, 	 our 	 deposit 	 journey 	 is 	 anchored in three strategic pillars– quality, cost, and growth. We’ve sharpened the quality of our  deposit book by improving granularity  and 	 focusing 	 on 	 LCR 	 accretive 	 deposits. Consequently, over the  past three years, we’ve improved our  outflow 	 ratio 	 by 	 340 	 basis 	 points, 	 now 	 aligning with the best in class among  large peer banks.  On the cost front, our disciplined  approach has kept the increase in cost  of 	 funds 	 to 	 just 	 7 	 basis 	 points 	 over 	 the 	 last 	 four 	 quarters, 	 despite 	 a 	 tight 	 liquidity environment. Our deposit growth engine is gaining  momentum as the Bank gained an  incremental market share of 5.5% in  total 	 deposits 	 over 	 the 	 last 	 five 	 years. 	 With 	 a 	 healthy 	 pipeline 	 of 	 acquisitions, 	 strategic 	 expansion, 	 innovative 	 product launches, and improving  performance in salary credits and  Burgundy AUMs, we’re beginning to  see early signs of sustained deposit  growth. 	 As 	 liquidity 	 conditions 	 ease 	 and 	 key 	 portfolios 	 stabilise, 	 our 	 efforts 	 should 	 translate 	 into 	 tangible outcomes.  The New–to–Bank (NTB) savings  account franchise is a standout  performer—NTB 	 deposits 	 grew 	 19% 	 y–o–y despite granular balances per  account 	 rising 	 17% 	 y–o–y, 	 reflecting 	 deeper customer engagement. While 	 fiscal 	 2025 	 posed 	 challenges 	 for 	 Existing–to–Bank 	 (ETB) 	 deposits 	 due 	 to 	 tight 	 liquidity 	 and 	 reduced 	 government 	 flows, 	 we 	 are 	 now 	 seeing early signs of recovery. Our  overarching focus is on deepening  relationships, 	 controlling 	 attrition, 	 and 	 becoming the primary bank of choice  as we see a powerful opportunity  in 	 our 	 existing 	 customer 	 base—not 	 just 	 to 	 grow 	 balances, 	 but 	 to 	 drive 	 sustainable value. Through smart,  contextual 	 journeys 	 and 	 timely 	 solutions, 	 we 	 are 	 creating 	 a 	 seamless 	 banking experience that grows with  our customers and strengthens    long–term 	 engagement. 	 In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 systemic deposit growth remained  subdued, primarily constrained by  the 	 persistent 	 tightness 	 in 	 durable 	 liquidity, muted government spending,  and 	 enhanced 	 efficiency 	 in 	 the 	 management of government balances.  However, 	 with 	 liquidity 	 conditions 	 having considerably improved post the  RBI 	 action, 	 the 	 macro 	 environment 	 is 	 poised to become more conducive for  deposit 	 mobilisation. 	 These 	 tailwinds, 	 coupled 	 with 	 more 	 accommodative 	 monetary policy stance could result in  a 	 better 	 deposit 	 growth 	 trajectory 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2026. Blending ambition with expertise  to create a new era of aspirational  banking. Premiumisation 	 of 	 the 	 deposits 	 franchise 	 continues 	 to 	 be 	 an 	 important 	 imperative 	 for 	 the 	 Bank. 	 We 	 are 	 accelerating 	 our 	 premiumisation 	 journey 	 with 	 a 	 sharp 	 focus 	 on 	   high–value customer segments.    Our 	 Burgundy 	 franchise 	 continues 	 to 	 thrive, with assets under management  (AUM) growing 10% y–o–y. Burgundy  Private, the private banking franchise  of the Bank catering to the UHNI  segment, 	 continues 	 to 	 grow 	 strongly 	 with 	 coverage 	 expanding 	 to 	 44 	 cities 	 managing 	 an 	 AUM 	 of 	 ₹2.13 	 trillion 	 (up 	 16% y–o–y) across ~13,400 families  (up 26% y–o–y), which includes 35 of  the Forbes 100 richest Indians. This  momentum has been recognised on  the global stage, with our Burgundy  Private 	 offering 	 being 	 named 	 India’s 	 Best for Next Gen at the Euromoney  Global Private Banking Awards 2025.  The Bank also won FT_PWM Wealth  Tech Awards 2025 for best CRM for  Private Banking in Asia. A 	 key 	 milestone 	 in 	 this 	 transformation 	 was 	 the 	 successful 	 integration 	 of 	 Citi’s 	 consumer 	 business 	 in 	 July 	 2024, 	 redefining 	 the 	 scale 	 and 	 scope 	 for 	 Axis 	 Bank in the premium segment.  During the year, the Bank introduced  several 	 new 	 product 	 propositions, 	 including the ‘ARISE’ savings account  for women and the Doctors Banking  Program, 	 to 	 offer 	 the 	 best 	 banking 	 services and life experiences under  one bouquet.  93 

Business performance review Retail remains the  engine of the Bank’s  granular performance,  contributing 	 60% 	 of 	 advances and 72% of  fee income. With 72%  of our book secured  and 100% of personal  loans with salaried  customers, we are  building a franchise  that is both high– performing and    high–quality. Driving Quality Loan Growth   with Precision and Purpose Our 	 SBB 	 portfolio 	 grew 	 a 	 strong 	 17% 	 y–o–y, 	 while 	 our 	 Rural 	 portfolio 	 expanded 	 by 	 7% 	 as 	 we 	 continue 	 to 	 pursue balanced, RAROC–led growth  in our retail segment. Notably, nearly  72% of our retail book remains  secured, underscoring the strength  and 	 resilience 	 of 	 our 	 portfolio. Retail 	 continues 	 to 	 be 	 the 	 engine 	 of 	 the Bank’s granular performance– contributing 	 60% 	 of 	 total 	 advances, 	 and 72% of the Bank’s fee income in  fiscal 	 2025. 	 By 	 leveraging 	 our 	 robust 	 digital infrastructure and advanced  data 	 analytics, 	 we 	 are 	 enhancing 	 operational 	 efficiency 	 and 	 decision– making. The unsecured retail segment is  exhibiting 	 industry–wide 	 stress, 	 driven 	 by 	 increased 	 credit 	 appetite 	 and 	 signs 	 of over-leverage in certain pockets,  particularly 	 in 	 personal 	 loans 	 (PL), 	 cards 	 and 	 micro–finance 	 segment 	 MFI 	 portfolio 	 is 	 only 	 ~1.2% 	 of 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 total 	 retail 	 loans. 	 We 	 are 	 navigating 	 this evolving credit landscape  with agility.  In the unsecured retail segment,  including MFI, we are seeing a  normalisation 	 cycle. 	 Proactive 	 risk 	 management 	 framework—anchored 	 in 	 real–time 	 portfolio 	 monitoring, 	 early warning triggers, and dynamic  policy 	 recalibration—has 	 ensured 	 that 	 delinquencies in new cohorts remain  well within our guardrails. We 	 continue 	 to 	 strengthen 	 the 	 core 	 pillars 	 of 	 our 	 risk 	 architecture— scorecards, 	 policy, 	 and 	 underwriting— while 	 tightening 	 standards 	 through 	 deliberate business mix choices. Our  focus on quality is evident: 100% of  our 	 personal 	 loan 	 portfolio 	 and 	 79% 	 of our credit card book is with salaried  customers. 	 Existing 	 to 	 bank 	 (ETB) 	 mix stands at 79% for personal loans  and 	 47% 	 for 	 credit 	 cards, 	 reflecting 	 our disciplined approach to customer  selection 	 and 	 portfolio 	 construction. 	 ~20% 	 of 	 credit 	 cards 	 acquired 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2025 were through Known to Bank  (KTB) channel. Powering Progress Across Bharat:  Banking that Builds Communities Our Bharat Banking franchise  continues 	 to 	 be 	 a 	 powerful 	 engine 	 of inclusive growth, delivering  healthy performance PSL assets and  expanding our footprint across rural  and 	 semi–urban 	 India. 	 In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 our rural advances and deposits  grew 	 by 	 7% 	 and 	 9%, 	 respectively. 	 Our 	 distribution 	 network 	 now 	 spans 	 2,736 branches, supported by a  formidable 28,000+ CSC Village  Level Entrepreneurs network. With  250+ new branches added this year  and over 25 strategic partnerships  across Agri–tech, Fintech, NBFCs, and  corporates, we are reaching deeper  into the heart of Bharat. This growth is underpinned by    a 	 digital–first 	 approach–e–KYC, 	   e–NACH, e–Sign, and e–Stamp are  now 	 integral 	 to 	 our 	 customer 	 journeys. 	 We’ve gone fully digital in our MFI– retail, 	 Farm 	 Mechanisation 	 verticals 	 and are set to onboard key segments  like Bharat Enterprise B2B Retail,  Farmer Funding (KCC), and Micro–LAP  in 	 fiscal 	 2026. 	 We 	 are 	 also 	 enhancing 	 operational 	 risk 	 controls 	 and 	 launching 	 instant 	 digital 	 CASA 	 journeys 	 to 	 further accelerate deposit growth. With 	 deep 	 distribution, 	 a 	 robust 	 digital 	 backbone, a thriving partnership  ecosystem, 	 and 	 proven 	 expertise 	 in rural lending, we are poised to  become a dominant force in Bharat.  Our focus remains on deepening  engagement, 	 enhancing 	 profitability, 	 scaling alternate revenue streams, and  driving sustainable, inclusive growth  across India. Redefining Payments: Scaling  Innovation, Deepening Impact India’s payments landscape is  undergoing 	 a 	 paradigm 	 shift—and 	 Axis Bank is at the forefront of  this 	 transformation. 	 As 	 customer 	 preferences evolve and digital  adoption 	 accelerates, 	 we 	 are 	 seizing 	 the 	 moment 	 to 	 lead 	 with 	 innovation, 	 scale, 	 and 	 precision. 	 In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 our 	 payments 	 business 	 continued 	 to 	 be 	 a cornerstone of our Retail strategy,  driving engagement and growth.

Our Wholesale  Banking franchise is now more agile, digital,  and future–ready than ever before.  At the heart of our Wholesale Banking  success 	 lies 	 a 	 strong, 	 relationship–led 	 franchise—one 	 that 	 thrives 	 on 	 deep 	 client 	 engagement 	 and 	 seamless 	 collaboration 	 across the ‘One Axis’ ecosystem. Over  the last 7 years, we’ve transformed into a  true ‘one–stop shop’ for the banking needs  of 	 Indian 	 corporates, 	 offering 	 integrated 	 solutions 	 that 	 span 	 the 	 entire 	 business 	 lifecycle—from 	 growth–stage 	 enterprises 	 to 	 large conglomerates.  This 	 evolution 	 is 	 more 	 than 	 structural— it’s 	 cultural. 	 It 	 reflects 	 our 	 commitment 	 to 	 execution 	 excellence, 	 powered 	 by 	 collaboration, 	 innovation, 	 and 	 a 	 unified 	 vision to deliver value at every touchpoint. Scaling up and Strengthening our  Wholesale Banking Franchise Axis Bank’s leadership in Wholesale  Banking was further cemented through  its strategic engagement and integrated  ‘One Axis’ approach, delivering end-to- end 	 solutions 	 to 	 Large 	 Corporates 	 & 	 Conglomerates, Mid & Small Enterprises,  MNCs, New Economy group, Infra & Real  estate, 	 and 	 Institutional 	 & 	 Government 	 entities.

Mid corporate including Small  Business 	 Banking 	 and 	 SME—expanded 	 ~14% 	 y-o-y, 	 now 	 representing 	 ~23% 	 of 	 the total loan book, a remarkable rise of  ~740 basis points over four years. The  SME segment stood out for its robustness,  with 	 Gross 	 NPA 	 at 	 just 	 0.77%, 	 Net 	 NPA 	 at 	 0.25%, and 88% PSL compliance.   The Bank also deepened its footprint in the  start-up ecosystem, forging partnerships  with unicorns and Series A+ ventures.  Tailored 	 offerings 	 like 	 the 	 Axis 	 Start- Up Card and neo APIs showcased its  commitment 	 to 	 innovation.

The Bank sees the MSME as a  transformative 	 force 	 for 	 the 	 next 	 decade— much like Retail was in the last. This is a  granular, sectorally diverse, and highly  profitable 	 business 	 that 	 we 	 are 	 deeply 	 committed 	 to 	 scaling. 	 With 	 a 	 strong 	 foundation, 	 prudent 	 risk 	 management, 	 and 	 a 	 clear 	 strategic 	 vision, 	 we 	 are 	 confident 	 that 	 our 	 MSME 	 franchise 	 will 	 continue 	 to 	 be a key element of our growth story.  Our 	 Wholesale 	 banking 	 business 	 continues 	 to 	 thrive, 	 offering 	 us 	 deeper 	 engagement 	 opportunities 	 through 	 deposits, 	 fee–based 	 products, and cross–sell. We are making  steady 	 progress 	 in 	 building 	 a 	 profitable 	 and sustainable Corporate Bank. Our  disciplined 	 approach 	 to 	 underwriting 	 and 	 pricing 	 ensures 	 that 	 we 	 selectively 	 pursue 	 opportunities 	 that 	 align 	 with 	 our 	 risk 	 appetite, 	 while 	 continuing 	 to 	 grow 	 our 	 portfolio 	 responsibly.

Driving Innovation and    Expanding Impact Axis 	 Bank 	 made 	 history 	 as 	 the 	 first 	 Indian 	 bank 	 to 	 execute 	 an 	 aircraft 	 financing 	 deal 	 through 	 its 	 International 	 Banking 	 Unit 	 at 	 GIFT 	 City—funding 	 34 	 training 	 aircraft 	 for 	 Air India’s pilot academy. India is becoming  a 	 hotspot 	 for 	 aircraft 	 manufacturers 	 due 	 to 	 its 	 growing 	 aviation 	 market 	 and 	 shifting 	 global 	 dynamics, 	 thereby 	 helping 	 manufacturers diversify market risk and this  pioneering 	 transaction 	 marks 	 a 	 bold 	 step 	 in 	 building 	 India’s 	 aviation 	 finance 	 ecosystem 	   and reinforces our leadership in    cross–border 	 innovation. We 	 further 	 accelerated 	 our 	 innovation 	 agenda and deepened our commitment to  empowering businesses across segments.  Our partnership with Marg ERP is  transforming 	 SME 	 banking 	 by 	 integrating 	 financial 	 services 	 directly 	 into 	 business 	 workflows–enhancing 	 agility, 	 efficiency, 	 and decision–making for our clients. We  also expanded our global footprint with  further 	 enhancement 	 of 	 our 	 International 	 Banking 	 Unit 	 at 	 GIFT 	 City, 	 offering 	 a 	 comprehensive 	 suite 	 of 	 digital–first 	 services 	 tailored for NRIs and global customers. In 	 our 	 continued 	 push 	 for 	 digital 	 leadership, 	 we 	 launched 	 India’s 	 first 	 UPI–enabled 	 Android Cash Recycler and introduced  Bharat Connect for Business  to streamline  working 	 capital 	 and 	 cash 	 flow 	 management 	 for 	 enterprises. 	 Our 	 collaboration 	 with 	 Next Bharat Ventures is unlocking access to  working capital for impact–driven startups  and MSMEs, especially in underserved Tier  2 	 and 	 Tier 	 3 	 regions—fostering 	 inclusive 	 economic growth. Through our New Economy Group, we  launched a Corporate Credit Card Suite  designed 	 specifically 	 for 	 startups, 	 offering 	 flexible, 	 value–rich 	 tools 	 to 	 support 	 their 	 evolving needs.  To further empower the merchant  community, we introduced  neo  for  Merchants  in partnership with VISA  and 	 a 	 fintech 	 company–a 	 mobile–first, 	 all–in–one 	 platform 	 that 	 simplifies 	 payments, 	 reporting, 	 and 	 service 	 requests. 	 Additionally, 	 we 	 enabled 	 seamless 	 GST payments via our Commercial  Card 	 platform, 	 helping 	 clients 	 optimize 	 working capital while enhancing  operational 	 efficiency. A Chapter Closes, A Legacy Continues As 	 I 	 prepare 	 to 	 retire 	 at 	 the 	 end 	 of 	 my 	 term 	 in 	 August 	 2025, 	 I 	 reflect 	 with 	 immense 	 pride 	 on 	 my 	 16–year 	 journey 	 with 	 Axis 	 Group—nearly 	 8 	 of 	 those 	 within 	 Wholesale 	 Banking. When I took the helm in 2018,  the 	 banking 	 industry 	 was 	 navigating 	 the 	 turbulence of the corporate led NPA  cycle. Today, we stand transformed being  evolved from an asset–focused model to  a 	 relationship–led 	 franchise 	 and 	 redefined 	 Transaction 	 Banking 	 with 	 industry–first 	 innovations 	 and 	 built 	 a 	 solution–led, 	 wholesale banking ecosystem.    Through ‘One Axis’, we served clients  across the capital structure, becoming the  Transaction 	 Bank 	 of 	 Choice. We’ve consistently led with an industry– first 	 mindset–executing 	 India’s 	 first 	 domestic 	 trade 	 transaction 	 on 	 a 	   GOI–backed 	 blockchain 	 platform, 	 pioneering SOFR–linked trade deals,    being 	 India’s 	 first 	 bank 	 on 	 aircraft 	 financing 	 solutions, 	 and 	 many 	 more. 	 This 	 reflects 	 our 	 commitment 	 to 	 innovation 	 and 	 our 	 drive 	 to 	 set new benchmarks in wholesale banking.  Initiatives 	 like 	 Project 	 neo  are steadily  shaping our vision of a leading digital  corporate bank.  Our presence at GIFT City has grown  stronger, and we’ve deepened our  engagement 	 with 	 government 	 entities 	 and 	 financial 	 sponsors. 	 These 	 efforts 	 have 	 contributed 	 to 	 steady 	 growth 	 in 	 liabilities 	 and fee income. India’s cyclical recovery is gaining  momentum, with real GDP growth  rebounding to 6.5% y–o–y in 2025, as  several headwinds begin to ease. However,  global 	 tariff 	 tensions 	 and 	 China’s 	 excess 	 capacity risks are clouding the outlook  for 	 fiscal 	 2026, 	 delaying 	 private 	 capex 	 recovery—even 	 as 	 corporate 	 balance 	 sheets 	 remain 	 strong 	 and 	 well–positioned 	 for future growth. We’ve undertaken a  comprehensive 	 bottom–up 	 analysis 	 of 	 tariff 	 impacts 	 across 	 industries 	 and 	 our 	 portfolio. 	 While 	 the 	 current 	 impact 	 appears 	 negligible, 	 we 	 remain 	 cautious 	 given 	 the 	 evolving global landscape. Despite these  uncertainties, 	 our 	 strong 	 balance 	 sheet, 	 prudent risk management, and focus on  relationship 	 RAROC 	 position 	 us 	 well 	 to 	 navigate 	 challenges 	 and 	 capture 	 profitable 	 growth 	 opportunities 	 in 	 future. 	 This 	 journey 	 has 	 been 	 one 	 of 	 purpose 	 and 	 transformation. 	 As 	 I 	 move 	 on, 	 I 	 do 	 so 	 knowing that Axis stands stronger, bolder,  and more future–ready than ever.

MESSAGE 	 FROM 	 THE 	 MANAGEMENT 	 – 	 OPERATIONS AND TRANSFORMATION Raising the bar with  each success Business performance review Subrat Mohanty Executive 	 Director 	 (Banking 	   Operations 	 & 	 Transformation) Dear Shareholders, Fiscal 2025 marked an important  chapter in our growth as we advanced  towards becoming a stronger, more  resilient franchise. Anchored by our GPS  strategy, we achieved sustained growth  and 	 profitability, 	 while 	 simultaneously 	 reimagining and reinforcing the  foundation 	 of 	 our 	 organisation. In previous updates, I highlighted three  strategic 	 priorities 	 that 	 continue 	 to 	 shape our long–term readiness:   » Strengthening and Modernising  our core systems and processes to  navigate increasing complexity and  shifting 	 business 	 dynamics.   » Developing future–focused  capabilities 	 that 	 leverage 	 technological advancements  and respond to evolving  customer 	 expectations.   » Championing responsible business  practices 	 and 	 setting 	 benchmarks 	   in 	 corporate 	 citizenship. We have made meaningful headway    in each of these areas. Strengthening our core Enhancing customer experience    and operational efficiency with    pioneering technology We remain steadfast in our  commitment to leverage technology– driven 	 initiatives 	 that 	 simplify 	 and 	 elevate the banking experience for our  customers. 	 In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 we 	 continued 	 to invest in building future–ready  infrastructure 	 by 	 embracing 	 continuous 	 innovation 	 and 	 rapid 	 adoption 	 of 	 emerging technologies. Our focus  areas 	 included 	 lending 	 transformation, 	 generative 	 AI 	 (GenAI), 	 hyper– personalisation, 	 digital 	 payments, 	 and 	 seamless 	 cloud 	 integration—all 	 aimed 	 at enhancing resilience and delivering  superior customer experiences. From 	 an 	 infrastructure 	 perspective, 	 we operate from two strategically  located primary data centres in  different 	 seismic 	 zones—Mumbai 	 and 	 Bengaluru—along 	 with 	 a 	 near–DR 	 data 	 centre 	 in 	 Bengaluru. 	 These 	 facilities 	 are equipped with high–performance  wide–area 	 network 	 connectivity 	 comprising of leased lines and  Multiprotocol 	 Label 	 Switching, 	 ensuring 	 seamless 	 application 	 delivery 	 across 	 domestic 	 and 	 international 	 operations. 	 Our 	 Cloud–first 	 and 	 Cloud–native 	 strategy 	 has 	 led 	 to 	 the 	 creation 	 of 	 three 	 enterprise–grade 	 landing 	 zones 	 and 	 the 	 deployment 	 of 	 over 	 150 	 applications 	 on the cloud. We have adopted  Continuous 	 Integration/ 	 Continuous 	 Delivery 	 practices 	 for 	 more 	 than 	 100 	 applications 	 and 	 became 	 the 	 first 	 Indian 	 bank 	 to 	 receive 	 ISO 	 certification 	 for cloud security on both AWS and  Azure 	 platforms. Fiscal 	 2025, 	 we 	 also 	 made 	 significant 	 strides in Central Bank Digital Currency  (CBDC) 	 initiatives. 	 We 	 became 	 the 	 first 	 bank in our cohort to go live with both  Android and iOS apps, surpassing key  adoption 	 milestones 	 with 	 over 	 0.65 	 million registered customers and more  than 	 6 	 million 	 transactions. 	 We 	 are 	 also the RBI’s preferred partner for the  Government–led Programmable CBDC  initiative, 	 collaborating 	 with 	 various 	 ministries 	 and 	 organisations. Driving operational excellence  To 	 enhance 	 operational 	 efficiency, 	 we launched Axis Deep Intelligence  (ADI), a GenAI–powered internal  chatbot now deployed over 5,500  branches 	 and 	 supporting 	 over 	 100,000 	 employees. 	 We 	 are 	 actively 	 integrating 	 AI/ML, 	 automation, 	 and 	 data 	 analytics 	 to improve customer engagement,  streamline 	 operations, 	 and 	 boost 	 workforce 	 productivity 	 through 	   AI–assisted 	 tools. 	 Additionally, 	 we 	 have 	 empowered departments with Co–pilot  capabilities, 	 deploying 	 over 	 4,500 	 bots 	 across 1,850+ automated processes.

Customer obsession Sparsh, our Customer Obsession  program, is a Bank–wide priority and  a 	 core 	 area 	 of 	 distinctiveness 	 for 	 us, 	 the tenets of which are now ingrained  across all our 5,800+ branches, every  customer touchpoint, and amongst all  our 1,05,000+ colleagues. It aims to  link 	 initiatives 	 to 	 enhance 	 customer 	 satisfaction, 	 leading 	 to 	 improved 	 NPS 	 and 	 better 	 business 	 outcomes. 	 We 	 have 	 been 	 improving 	 our 	 institutional 	 capabilities 	 by 	 empowering 	 our 	 employees with Adi (Our Gen AI  Platform) 	 and 	 Kaleidoscope 	 (a 	 single 	 chronological view of customer  footprint, across various channels to  improve 	 first–contact 	 resolution). 	 We have gained 59 (159 on indexed  baseline of 100) points on retail NPS in  fiscal 	 2025 	 and 	 retained 	 Rank 	 2 	 in 	 India 	 in the external benchmarking study  undertaken by independent agency  Kantar for Axis Bank.

Our modern data stack  integrates 	 cloud 	 native 	 tools, 	 real–time 	 data pipelines and manage 3+ Peta  Byte 	 to 	 enable 	 faster 	 analytics. 		 Premiumisation of our franchise We had completed an important  step 	 on 	 our 	 premiumisation 	 agenda 	 with 	 acquisition 	 of 	 Citibank 	 India 	 consumer businesses in March 2023  (Legal Day1) and added diverse talent  pool 	 of 	 3200+ 	 Citi 	 employees 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 the 	 acquisition. 	 As 	 the 	 second 	 leg 	 of 	 the 	 acquisition, 	 we 	 completed 	 the 	 migration 	 of 	 customer 	 data 	 from 	 Citibank 	 systems 	 to 	 Axis 	 Bank 	 systems in July 2024 (Legal Day2).  This 	 marks 	 full 	 integration 	 of 	 ~2.4 	 mn 	 customers 	 with 	 their 	 multiple 	 products 	 migrating 	 into 	 Axis 	 Bank’s 	 platform. 	 Customers are now able to access  the comprehensive suite of Axis’s  financial 	 solutions. Fortifying our defences Digitisation 	 of 	 banking 	 services 	 continues 	 to 	 create 	 both 	 newer 	 opportunities 	 and 	 threats 	 in 	 many 	 areas. 	 One 	 such 	 interesting 	 area 	 is 	 fraud 	 prevention, 	 where 	 digitisation 	 is 	 both a threat and an opportunity. At  Axis 	 Bank, 	 we 	 are 	 committed 	 to 	 making 	 banking safe and trustworthy for our  customers. 	 We 	 continue 	 to 	 invest 	 in 	 real 	 time 	 transaction 	 and 	 stakeholder 	 monitoring, dynamic onboarding  checks, 	 use 	 of 	 analytics 	 and 	 technology 	 across 	 our 	 businesses 	 to 	 not 	 just 	 mitigate 	 fraud 	 risk 	 but 	 also 	 build 	 fraud 	 prevention 	 as 	 our 	 formidable 	 strength 	 and 	 competitive 	 advantage 	 by 	 investing 	 in it for the long term. By fostering a  risk–first 	 culture 	 coupled 	 with 	 customer 	 centricity, 	 analytics 	 and 	 technology, 	 the bank is building a robust defence  against 	 fraud 	 thereby 	 proactively 	 protecting 	 our 	 customers’ 	 trust 	 and 	 ensuring a safer and more secure  financial 	 landscape. 	 Our 	 award 	 winning 	 initiative 	 on 	 “Sanskrit 	 Password” 	 is 	 an 	 innovative 	 blend 	 of 	 tradition 	 and 	 technology—to 	 enhance 	 digital 	 security 	 while 	 reconnecting 	 individuals 	 with 	 India’s 	 rich 	 linguistic 	 heritage. Being a responsible    corporate citizen We 	 remain 	 committed 	 to 	 the 	 model 	 of banking that fosters a more  inclusive and equitable economy,  empowers 	 thriving 	 communities 	 and 	 support a healthier planet. Over the  year, 	 we 	 continued 	 to 	 build 	 a 	 strong, 	 stakeholder–focused ESG culture  at 	 the 	 Bank. 	 Our 	 CSR 	 interventions 	 now 	 reach 	 millions 	 of 	 participants 	 in 	 all 	 corners 	 of 	 India. 	 Our 	 flagship 	 program – ‘Sustainable Livelihoods’,  achieved 	 a 	 significant 	 milestone 	 by 	 impacting 	 2.05 	 million 	 participants 	 in 	 300 districts in 32 states and union  territories as of March 31, 2025. Under  the Axis ‘DilSe’ umbrella, our programs  in 	 Education 	 reach 	 thousands 	 of 	 children especially in the North–east  and eastern India. This year, the Bank  introduced 	 sports 	 as 	 a 	 new 	 thematic 	 area 	 and 	 is 	 supporting 	 interventions 	 from the grassroots to the Olympics  and Paralympics level. We are beginning to see the tangible  outcomes of our steadfast commitment  to 	 the 	 GPS 	 strategy 	 and 	 transformation 	 agenda. With each milestone we reach,  expectations 	 grow 	 — 	 and 	 so 	 does 	 our 	 resolve. 	 We 	 remain 	 deeply 	 motivated 	 to 	 sustain 	 this 	 momentum 	 and 	 continue 	 delivering against the ever–rising  aspirations 	 of 	 our 	 stakeholders.

When 	 a 	 senior 	 citizen 	 visited 	 a 	 branch intending to prematurely  close 	 his 	 ₹30 	 lakhs 	 FD, 	 Bank 	 Officer 	 Sivaprakash sensed something  was amiss. The customer seemed  unusually tense and was found to  be 	 receiving 	 instructions 	 from 	 a 	 fraudster 	 via 	 WhatsApp. 	 Acting 	 swiftly, 	 Sivaprakash 	 alerted 	 Operations 	 Head 	 Sasikala 	 and 	 Branch Head Kavitha Venkatesan.  Though 	 the 	 customer 	 initially 	 resisted their concern, the team  patiently 	 explained 	 similar 	 scam 	 cases. When the fraudster called  again, Kavitha insisted on a video  call, causing the fraudster to hang  up and erase all chat history. Through quick thinking and  teamwork, 	 the 	 branch 	 staff 	 prevented the customer from losing  his life savings and protected him  from being defrauded. “This 	 is 	 an 	 immensely 	 satisfying 	 and 	 proud moment for Axisians.

Living our Values, Together For employees At Axis Bank, we take pride in  upholding 	 our 	 five 	 core 	 values, 	 which 	 form 	 the 	 foundation 	 of 	 our 	 business 	 strategy –  ownership, teamwork,  transparency, ethics, customer centricity .   These values are pivotal in fostering a  high–performance culture within the  organisation 	 and 	 our 	 goal 	 is 	 that 	 All of Us   at Axis live these values  All the Time . Since the launch of our Values in 2019,  the Bank has consistently embedded  them 	 across 	 the 	 employee’s 	 journey. 	 In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 we 	 refreshed 	 the 	 framework 	 to align the value behaviours with  strategic 	 business 	 priorities. 	 A 	 Steering 	 Committee 	 comprising 	 12 	 leaders 	 was 	 set 	 up 	 and 	 after 	 300+ 	 conversations 	 with employees and leaders, 1,400  committee 	 man–hours, 	 and 	 3 	 in–depth 	 culture workshops with leaders of the  Axis Group, a new set of behaviours  were 	 drafted. 	 The 	 articulation 	 is 	 aspirational 	 and 	 emphasises 	 on 	 collective 	 ownership. 	 To 	 embed 	 the 	 refreshed 	 values, 	 85 	 senior 	 leaders— including 	 the 	 Management 	 Committee— conducted 	 sessions 	 across 	 70 	 cities, 	 reaching over 4,500 people managers to  ensure 	 last–mile 	 adoption 	 in 	 their 	 teams. Further, we expanded our network  of Axis Values Realisers (AVRs) from  1,332 	 to 	 2,339. 	 They 	 play 	 a 	 critical 	 role 	 in embedding a value–driven culture  throughout 	 the 	 organisation 	 via 	   year–round sessions. Fostering Transparency and Fairness Transparency—one of our core  values—shapes a culture of  openness and trust at Axis Bank.  Through open–door leadership and  strong whistleblower policies, we  uphold ethical conduct at every  level, ensuring a safe, respectful  environment where everyone  can thrive.  Performance Management Our performance management system  is 	 built 	 on 	 objectivity, 	 featuring 	 Key 	 Results Areas (KRAs) and 360–degree  feedback. We ensure bias–free  evaluation 	 through 	 moderation 	 committees 	 and 	 offer 	 training 	 for 	 managers 	 to 	 provide 	 constructive, 	 growth–focused feedback. Through  RetrACE  employees are  able to revisit their performance  journey 	 and 	 raise 	 concerns 	 about 	 their 	 performance for the year.  These are reviewed by an independent  Apex 	 Committee 	 comprising 	 senior leadership. Competitive Compensation &  Benchmarking  We 	 partner 	 with 	 Aon 	 Consulting 	 Pvt. 	 Ltd. to benchmark salaries against  industry standards. Our performance– linked 	 incentive 	 structures 	 reward 	 high performers, and we remain  committed 	 to 	 equal 	 pay 	 for 	 equal 	 work, 	 eliminating 	 gender 	 pay 	 gaps. CEO Compensation CEO 	 compensation 	 for 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 MD 	 & CEO is in line with the guidelines  stated in the RBI circular dated  November 4, 2019. The Bank uses  a Balanced Scorecard approach to  assess the CEO’s performance. The  scorecard contains KPIS for the MD &  CEO under a range of areas, including  financial 	 performance, 	 internal 	 processes, compliance, people,  execution, 	 and 	 performance 	 of subsidiaries. The MD & CEO’s variable pay  consists of a performance bonus  and 	 stock–linked 	 incentive. 	 The variable pay is governed  by regulatory guidelines, which  include deferral arrangements. While part of the performance  bonus is deferred over the  subsequent three performance  periods, 	 the 	 stock–linked 	 incentive 	 vests over 48 months from the  date 	 of 	 the 	 grant. 	 The 	 entire 	 variable 	 pay 	 is 	 subject 	 to 	 Malus/ Clawback clauses as per the  Bank’s policy. teamwork ownership transparency ethics customer   centricity 141

We 	 remain 	 careful 	 and 	 selective 	 in the retail unsecured segment,  particularly 	 personal 	 loans 	 and 	 credit cards.

The Sustainable  Livelihood Program  Lives and livelihoods in rural India  are deeply intertwined with natural  ecosystems – land, water, and forests.  It forms the bedrock of wellbeing  for 	 millions 	 of 	 our 	 citizens. 	 Shrinking 	 landholdings, water insecurity, dated  practices, 	 and 	 weak 	 market 	 linkages 	 strain 	 rural 	 incomes, 	 particularly 	 for 	 those that have to rely on a single  source of income.   Launched 	 in 	 2011, 	 our 	 flagship 	 initiative 	 – The Sustainable Livelihood Program  (SLP) addresses these challenges by  creating 	 diverse 	 sources 	 of 	 income 	 and fostering reliance in several ways  to ensure longer term economic  and ecological sustainability.  SLP  prioritises 	 support 	 to 	 small 	 and 	 marginal 	 farmers, 	 landless 	 families, 	 artisans, 	 entrepreneurs, especially youth and  People 	 with 	 Disabilities 	 (PWDs). 	 2.05  million Rural families across  23,000+ villages, across 32  States/Union Territories  positively impacted  (cumulatively) as of    March 31, 2025. This includes:   » 1.95 million rural families   » 92,794 youth trained in  vocational skills which  included 25,045 PWDs. Implemented 	 by 	 Axis 	 Bank 	 Foundation 	 in partnership with grassroots NGOs  and 	 community 	 institutions, 	 SLP 	 is 	 designed to strengthen livelihoods  through 	 a 	 multi-dimensional 	 approach 	 fostering a basket of livelihood  opportunities. 	 Multiple 	 sources 	 of 	 income are promoted and stabilised  by improving skills, introducing  better 	 farming 	 methods, 	 promotion 	 of 	 horticulture, 	 livestock 	 rearing, 	 developing micro enterprises, enabling  access 	 to 	 finance 	 and 	 direct 	 market 	 connects. The underlying ecological  challenges are addressed through  active 	 community 	 ownership 	 and 	 participation 	 in 	 local 	 governance. Diversified 	 income 	 sources 	 lead 	 to 	 more 	 stable 	 cash 	 flows 	 through 	 the year. To an extent, local stable  incomes 	 reduce 	 distress 	 migration. 	 To enhance overall wellbeing SLP  focusses on improving health and  nutrition 	 for 	 rural 	 families. 	 The 	 health 	 and 	 nutrition 	 focus 	 of 	 the 	 program 	 adopts a life cycle approach. It works  with 	 lactating 	 mothers, 	 young 	 children 	 and adolescents, guiding and nudging  them to improve their health seeking  behaviour and foster linkages with  the public health systems. Improved  health not only helps in reducing wage,  but it also enhances the quality of life. This integrated approach is helping  rural 	 communities 	 to 	 become 	 more 	 self–reliant, ecologically aware, and  economically secure. SLP addresses  local and contextual vulnerability  into opportunity, ensuring that when  livelihoods are secured, families  and 	 communities 	 can 	 thrive 	 with 	 confidence 	 and 	 dignity. 153 For 	 communities

People Ravindra Mallesh, a hardworking  farmer, dedicated long hours  to his land. His wife shared his  burden, spending endless days  watering 	 fields 	 by 	 hand. 	 Their 	 young son, instead of focusing on  his 	 education, 	 was 	 often 	 pulled 	 into 	 farm 	 labour. 	 The 	 entire 	 family 	 felt 	 the 	 strain—physically, 	 financially, 	 and 	 emotionally. Case Study Progress The 	 introduction 	 of 	 sprinkler 	 irrigation 	 brought 	 significant 	 changes 	 for Ravindra and his family. The  system ensured uniform water  distribution, 	 reduced 	 soil 	 erosion, 	 and improved crop health. It also  cut labour and input costs, allowing  the couple to pursue other income  sources and enabling their son to  return to school. The result was a  more 	 stable 	 and 	 productive 	 farm. Highlighting  the Impact of  the Sustainable  Livelihood  Program Blending Tradition with  Technology: How Innovation  Revitalised Farming for a family  in Telangana When 	 technology 	 meets 	 traditional 	 agricultural 	 practices, 	 it 	 creates 	 a powerful blend of wisdom and  innovation. 	 In 	 India, 	 many 	 farming 	 communities 	 rely 	 on 	 techniques 	 that 	 have been passed down through  generations. 	 However, 	 with 	 climate 	 change, increasing water demand,  and declining water availability,  these challenges have become  more complex. In Dhamargidda, a district in  Telangana, farmers faced these  struggles 	 firsthand. 	 One 	 such 	 farmer, Ravindra Mallesh (name  changed to protect privacy),  relied 	 on 	 traditional 	 irrigation 	 for his red soil land. His method  required intensive manual labour,  exhausting 	 both 	 him 	 and 	 his 	 wife. Pathway The Sustainable Livelihood Program  played a crucial role in enabling  this 	 transformation. 	 Through 	 its 	 initiatives, 	 Ravindra 	 received 	 training 	 in 	 modern 	 irrigation 	 practices, 	 along 	 with 	 access 	 to 	 subsidies and technical support.  Continuous 	 guidance 	 helped 	 him 	 transition 	 smoothly 	 and 	 maintain 	 the 	 system 	 effectively. 	 The 	 ongoing 	 training and constant learning  initiatives 	 under 	 the 	 program 	 ensured that farmers could address  any 	 operational 	 challenges 	 and 	 maximise 	 the 	 benefits 	 of 	 their 	 new 	 irrigation 	 systems. The 	 adoption 	 of 	 efficient 	 irrigation 	 not only improved Ravindra’s crop  yields 	 and 	 financial 	 stability 	 but 	 also enhanced his family’s overall  wellbeing. Ravindra’s story is a  clear 	 example 	 of 	 how 	 integrating 	 simple 	 technology 	 with 	 traditional 	 farming, supported by the right  proper training and resources, can  transform livelihoods and build  resilient 	 rural 	 communities. 155 For 	 communities

Other Focus Areas Our 	 community–centric 	 efforts 	 span 	 multiple 	 social 	 and 	 environmental 	 impact 	 dimensions 	 – 	 from 	 protecting 	 nature 	 and 	 providing accessible healthcare to ensuring rapid humanitarian responses and fostering talent through sports. Each of  these 	 initiatives 	 resonates 	 deeply 	 with 	 our 	 philosophy 	 of 	 ‘ Har raah dil se open’ , 	 which 	 translates 	 to 	 inclusive 	 action 	 for 	 holistic 	 community 	 development. Environmental Sustainability – Nurturing a Greener Tomorrow Recognising 	 the 	 critical 	 role 	 of 	 the 	 environment 	 in 	 supporting 	 livelihoods and enhancing quality of life, the Bank is deeply  committed 	 to 	 ecological 	 conservation 	 and 	 climate 	 resilience. 	 Our 	 flagship 	 Mission 	 2 	 Million 	 Trees 	 aims 	 to 	 create 	 a 	 substantial 	 green cover across India by 2027. As of March 2025, the  bank through its CSR partners has planted ~3.27 million trees  (including 	 the 	 2 	 million 	 target 	 and 	 other 	 plantations, 	 combined). 	 The 	 Bank 	 is 	 further 	 expanding 	 its 	 activities 	 related 	 to 	 habitat 	 restoration. 	 As 	 part 	 of 	 this 	 initiative, 	 the 	 Bank 	 has 	 set 	 a 	 target 	 of 	 planting 	 ~8 	 million 	 trees 	 by 	 2030 	 (including 	 all 	 earlier 	 plantations). Our 	 ambitious 	 projects 	 include 	 the 	 restoration 	 of 	 critical 	 mangrove habitats in Tamil Nadu, extensive agroforestry and  forest 	 regeneration 	 programs 	 in 	 Assam 	 and 	 Madhya 	 Pradesh, 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 initiatives 	 aimed 	 at 	 mitigating 	 human–wildlife 	 conflicts 	 in 	 Karnataka. 	 In 	 addition, 	 the 	 Miyawaki 	 Urban 	 Forest 	 in 	 Navi 	 Mumbai 	 is 	 a 	 vibrant 	 example 	 of 	 integrating 	 biodiversity 	 within 	 cityscapes, enhancing both ecological health and the wellbeing  of 	 local 	 communities. 	 These 	 collective 	 efforts 	 form 	 part 	 of 	 our 	 overarching 	 ESG 	 commitments, 	 aligning 	 closely 	 with 	 national 	 climate goals. Healthcare & Nutrition – Strengthening Access, Improving Lives Good 	 health 	 is 	 foundational 	 to 	 thriving 	 communities. 	 Acknowledging 	 India’s 	 growing 	 healthcare 	 challenges, 	 the 	 Bank 	 has 	 intensified 	 its 	 focus 	 on 	 healthcare 	 and 	 nutrition 	 interventions 	 significantly. Our 	 strategic 	 collaboration 	 with 	 the 	 National 	 Cancer 	 Grid 	 (NCG) 	 through the Tata Memorial Centre is transforming cancer care across  the 	 nation. 	 With 	 an 	 investment 	 of 	 ₹100 	 crores 	 over 	 five 	 years, 	 this 	 partnership aims to establish robust telehealth systems, implement  cutting–edge 	 Electronic 	 Medical 	 Records 	 (EMRs), 	 create 	 India’s 	 first 	 National 	 Tumour 	 Biobank, 	 and 	 provide 	 targeted 	 patient 	 engagement 	 solutions. 	 Concurrently, 	 our 	 partnership 	 with 	 the 	 Indian 	 Cancer 	 Society 	 emphasises 	 preventive 	 care, 	 offering 	 widespread 	 screening 	 camps 	 targeting 	 oral, 	 cervical, 	 and 	 breast 	 cancers, 	 reaching 	 over 	   8 lakh individuals. Additionally, 	 we 	 support 	 the 	 establishment 	 of 	 a 	 pioneering 	 Paediatrics 	 Specialty 	 Centre 	 at 	 the 	 Indian 	 Institute 	 of 	 Science 	 (IISc) 	 in 	 Bengaluru, 	 which 	 will 	 significantly 	 enhance 	 paediatric 	 healthcare 	 infrastructure 	 and 	 capabilities 	 for 	 advanced 	 medical 	 research, 	 setting 	 new 	 benchmarks 	 for 	 care 	 and 	 scientific 	 discovery. Humanitarian Relief – Responding Swiftly,    Restoring Dignity We recognise our responsibility to respond promptly during  humanitarian 	 crises. 	 Throughout 	 the 	 year, 	 the 	 Bank 	 actively 	 extended 	 support 	 to 	 communities 	 severely 	 impacted 	 by 	 natural 	 calamities 	 and 	 socio–political 	 conflicts. In 	 Assam’s 	 Majuli 	 district, 	 we 	 partnered 	 with 	 Ayang 	 Trust 	 and 	 Balipara 	 Foundation 	 to 	 ensure 	 effective 	 relief 	 measures 	 following 	 the 	 devastating 	 floods. 	 In 	 response 	 to 	 severe 	 ethnic 	 conflicts 	 in 	 Manipur, 	 our 	 alliance 	 with 	 Sunbird 	 Trust 	 provided 	 critical 	 relief 	 by 	 providing 	 shelters 	 and 	 essential 	 support systems for displaced families. Furthermore, we  expanded our humanitarian assistance in Karnataka’s  Kodagu 	 district, 	 contributing 	 to 	 the 	 reconstruction 	 of 	 sustainable 	 housing 	 for 	 flood–affected 	 families. 	 Our 	 commitment 	 during 	 these 	 times 	 of 	 distress 	 ensures 	 immediate 	 relief, 	 coupled 	 with 	 initiatives 	 that 	 foster 	   long–term recovery and community rebuilding. Through 	 our 	 humanitarian 	 relief 	 efforts, 	 we 	 have 	 positively 	 impacted 7,278 households. Sports – Empowering Champions, Inspiring Communities This year marks the expansion of the Bank’s commitment to  community 	 upliftment 	 through 	 sports.

In 	 addition, 	 our 	 partnership 	 with 	 the 	 Inspire 	 Institute 	 of Sports has led to the launch of the ‘Axis Bank Judo Development  Program’. 	 The 	 program 	 develops 	 judo 	 talent 	 across 	 India, 	 with 	 a 	 special 	 focus 	 on 	 talent 	 in 	 Manipur, 	 considering 	 the 	 state 	 being 	 a 	 judo 	 hot 	 bed 	 in India. The program integrated a total of 157 athletes. 104 athletes  in Manipur were provided with training sessions at the Judo Academy  in 	 Manipur, 	 in 	 partnership 	 with 	 the 	 Manipur 	 Judo 	 Association 	 (MJA), 	 while 	 53 	 female 	 judokas 	 were 	 awarded 	 full 	 scholarships 	 to 	 study 	 and 	 train 	 at 	 the 	 state–of–the–art 	 IIS 	 campus 	 in 	 Vijayanagar, 	 Karnataka 	 for 	 the high–performance program.    The athletes also received sports science support from the IIS  Vijayanagar 	 central 	 sports 	 science 	 team.

SUSTAINABLE FINANCE Investing in a  Sustainable Future As 	 an 	 Indian 	 financial 	 institution 	 of 	 repute, we support the country’s  development agenda in alignment  with the UN Sustainable Development  Goals (UN SDGs) and India’s  commitments under the Paris  Agreement. We invest in sectors that  drive equitable and environmentally  responsible progress. Our Sustainable  Financing Framework, aligned to the  UN SDGs and launched in August  2021, is a blueprint for ESG–linked    issuances. 	 It 	 is 	 the 	 first 	 such 	 framework by an Indian Bank to  receive a Second Party Opinion, and  its 	 implementation 	 is 	 overseen 	 by 	 our 	 ESG Working Group. Aware of the environmental and  social impact of its business, the Bank  integrates Environmental, Social and  Governance 	 (ESG) 	 considerations 	 into 	 its investment decisions. Since 2021,  the 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 of 	 the 	 Board 	 has been guiding and overseeing the  Bank’s 	 efforts 	 in 	 this 	 matter, 	 with 	 a 	 sharp focus on managing climate– related as well as ESG–related risks.  Under 	 the 	 ESG 	 Committee’s 	 guidance 	 and led by the Risk Management  Department, we are enhancing  our 	 capabilities 	 and 	 frameworks 	 for climate risk management at  the 	 enterprise 	 level. 	 This 	 proactive 	 approach not only safeguards our  operations 	 but 	 also 	 positions 	 us 	 to 	 capitalise 	 on 	 emerging 	 opportunities 	   in the evolving climate landscape. Har raah  dil se open Managing our    Climate Risk The interplay of climate risk and  financial 	 risk 	 poses 	 complex 	 challenges to the economy and its  participants. 	 Climate 	 risks 	 both 	 physical 	 and 	 transition–related 	 operate through diverse channels  and require comprehensive risk  management since these impact  business 	 profitability, 	 household 	 wealth, 	 financial 	 stability, 	 and 	 could 	 potentially 	 lead 	 to 	 stranded 	 assets. 	 At both micro and macro levels, the  fallout may range from property  damage 	 to 	 capital 	 depreciation. 	 For 	 the 	 financial 	 sector, 	 this 	 translates to heightened credit,  market, 	 underwriting, 	 operational, 	 and 	 liquidity 	 risks, 	 manifesting 	 as 	 higher defaults, asset repricing,  insurance 	 coverage 	 gaps, 	 operational 	 disruptions, 	 and 	 strained 	 liquidity. Actions undertaken under ESG  Committee and Risk functions can be  broadly placed into four focus areas: Governance Strengthening Board–level Oversight  on Climate and ESG Risks Climate and ESG risks have been  formally integrated into our risk  categories and are managed under the  oversight 	 of 	 the 	 Risk 	 Committee 	 of 	 the Board. As we broaden their scope  in our Risk Management Framework,  we 	 continue 	 to 	 strengthen 	 the 	 Committee’s 	 governance 	 of 	 these 	 risks. 	 The 	 Board’s 	 Committee 	 of 	 Directors also evaluates key cases,  including their assessment as per our  ‘ESG Policy for Lending’ to ensure  alignment with our risk management  strategy. Policy and Controls ESG & Climate–related Risks and  Opportunities included in ICAAP    Our Internal Capital Adequacy  Assessment (ICAAP) evaluates ESG  and climate risks as material risks,  including both physical risk and  transition 	 risk. 	 Strengthening the ESG Policy  for Lending  Our ‘ESG Policy for Lending’  integrates environmental and social  risk assessment into our credit  appraisal process in alignment with  international 	 standards. 	 The 	 policy’s 	 implementation 	 is 	 overseen 	 by 	 the 	 Environmental and Social Management  Group 	 within 	 the 	 Credit 	 vertical. Adopting the Sustainable Financing  Framework and Establishing the ESG  Working Group    Our Sustainable Financing  Framework, launched in 2021 in  alignment with global standards  like 	 those 	 of 	 the 	 International 	 Capital 	 Market 	 Association 	 (ICMA) 	 and 	 the 	 Association 	 of 	 Southeast 	 Asian 	 Nations 	 (ASEAN), 	 is 	 endorsed 	 by 	 Sustainalytics. 	 We 	 have 	 also 	 established the ESG Working  Group to ensure compliance in our  financing 	 activities. Risk Toolkit ESG Rating Model Part of Credit  Appraisal  Piloted 	 in 	 fiscal 	 2023, 	 our 	 ESG 	 rating 	 model has been implemented as part  of the credit appraisal process for  select Wholesale Banking clients.  Developed in–house, it encompasses  over 80 parameters across the  Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 168 

E, S, and G pillars. This model aligns  closely 	 with 	 International 	 Finance 	 Corporation 	 (IFC) 	 Performance 	 Standards, reinforcing our  commitment 	 to 	 integrating 	 ESG 	 principles 	 into 	 our 	 lending 	 practices. 	 In 	 current 	 fiscal 	 year, 	 we 	 have 	 further 	 enhanced 	 this 	 ESG 	 rating 	 model 	 at 	 a 	 borrower level. Building Capabilities around  Stress Testing   We 	 are 	 building 	 stress 	 testing 	 and 	 scenario 	 analysis 	 capabilities 	 in 	 line with regulatory guidance and  expectations 	 and 	 studying 	 external 	 best 	 practices 	 to 	 expedite 	 our 	 learning process. Developing Climate Risk Dashboards  Since 	 the 	 previous 	 fiscal 	 year, 	 we 	 have been working to enhance  our disclosure on climate risks,  covering key metrics for physical and  transition 	 risks, 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 our 	 lending 	 and 	 financing 	 activities 	 to 	 sectors 	 aligned to the Sustainable Financing  Framework. 	 During 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 we 	 presented a snapshot of the Bank’s  transition 	 risk, 	 highlighting 	 exposures 	 and asset quality in sectors facing  high 	 transition 	 risk, 	 such 	 as 	 coal 	 and 	 thermal power. For physical risks, we  assessed the Bank’s retail, rural and  SME 	 portfolios 	 against 	 four 	 major 	 natural 	 hazards 	 in 	 India 	 – 	 cyclones, 	 droughts, 	 heat 	 waves, 	 and 	 floods. 	 These assessments were presented to  the 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 during 	 the 	 year. Capacity Building Bank–wide ESG Education  and Participation We rolled out a Bank–wide ESG  e–module last year, introducing  employees to concepts including  ESG, climate–related risks and  opportunities, 	 pertinent 	 national 	 and 	 international 	 frameworks 	 and 	 regulations, 	 and 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 own 	 policies 	 and 	 activities 	 in 	 this 	 space. 	 Apart from the specialised internal  and external trainings and awareness  programs arranged by the Bank,  programs undertaken by regulatory  agencies 	 and 	 industry 	 organisations 	 keep the Bank’s employees updated  on 	 these 	 matters. 	 In 	 fiscal 	 2024–25, 	   For 	 the 	 environment 	 - 	 Sustainable 	 finance a two–day climate risk training  workshop was organised by Indian  and foreign experts under a UK  government program for emerging  economies (UK PACT), which saw the  participation 	 of 	 the 	 entire 	 Risk 	 and 	 Corporate 	 Underwriting 	 verticals 	 of 	 the Bank.  Engagement with Peers  and Regulators The 	 Bank 	 also 	 proactively 	 engages 	 with the wider industry, its peers,  and the regulators on the key topics,  including ESG, climate risk, and  sustainable 	 finance. 	 The 	 Bank’s 	 leadership is on key ESG and Climate  committees, 	 and 	 formal 	 groupings, 	 including at the RBI, IBA, CII and  FICCI, among others.  In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 the 	 Bank 	 actively 	 engaged with the Reserve Bank of  India on climate risk management and  other material topics, sharing its inputs  and 	 recommendations 	 to 	 further 	 the 	 banking 	 sector’s 	 active 	 participation 	 in 	 India’s 	 climate 	 transition. 169 

Har raah  dil se open ESG Policy for Lending Formulated in 2015, our ESG  Policy for Lending is aligned to the  IFC performance standards and  other 	 international 	 standards 	 and 	 frameworks 	 on 	 sustainable 	 financing 	 and lending. It is applied to various  financial 	 products, 	 including 	 project 	 loans, corporate loans, lines of credit,  bridge loans, overseas funding,  consortium/multiple 	 banking, 	 syndicated 	 loans, 	 and 	 refinance 	 transactions, 	 subject 	 to 	 internal 	 criteria and threshold limits. Under the guidance of the ESG  Committee, 	 the 	 Bank 	 has 	 further 	 expanded the scope of the Policy  to 	 further 	 tighten 	 the 	 E&S 	 due 	 diligence requirements for proposals  for sectors perceived to have high  climate-related risks. The Policy is  managed 	 by 	 a 	 specialized 	 team 	 of 	 E&S 	 risk professionals housed under the  Corporate 	 Underwriting 	 vertical. 	 As a part of its due diligence, the Bank  also 	 actively 	 engages 	 with 	 and 	   advises 	 its 	 stakeholders 	 on 	 adopting 	   climate-smart 	 best 	 practices. 447 Proposals assessed under  ESG Policy for Lending in  fiscal 2025 D 51,000   crores Total value of proposals  reviewed under the ESG  Policy for Lending in    fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2025 Cat A Cat B+ Cat B Cat C Cat Fl Total Count Cases Eligible 1 0 74 2 1 78 COD 	 cases 	 Review 	 of 	 Project 	 portfolio/Group 	 Companies 	 portfolio 	 w.r.t.

It is to be noted that due to  material changes in the proposal or project, the categorisation of cases can also change over the  duration of the loan. In fiscal 2022, projects were categorised as A, B+, B, C, FI under our ESG  Policy for Lending. We undertook a self–assessment of the policy under the IFC’s ESMS diagnostic  tool, which benchmarks environmental and social management systems (such as our ESG Policy  for Lending) against IFC’s performance standards and global best practices. The tool evaluates on  the basis of nine parameters, such as policy, due diligence, governance, capacity, and the control  environment, categorising them as ‘State of the Art’, ‘Developed’, and ‘Emerging’. Our ESG Policy  for Lending scored ‘State of the Art’ on four parameters and ‘Developed’ on three. We are now  embedding the learnings into our processes.  369 Cases related to sustainable  financing were heard at the  Board–level during the year Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 170 

Case Studies Highlighting Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD)  Conducted under the ESG Policy for Lending Case Study Case Study Empowering  Green Mobility  with    ESG–driven  Lending  Oversight Independent  Consulting  for High–risk  Assets  To boost e–mobility in rural and  non–Metro India, a targeted loan  product was designed, especially  for 	 low–income 	 communities. 	 This 	 initiative, 	 part 	 of 	 a 	 co–lending 	 arrangement with a sub–borrower  (an NBFC in this case), also aimed  to 	 support 	 affordable 	 transport 	 solutions 	 and 	 green 	 infrastructure. What set this lending apart was the  due diligence conducted on sub– borrower’s 	 operations, 	 including 	 upstream and downstream lending,  in alignment with IFC performance  standards. 	 Among 	 the 	 major 	 points 	 considered were Environmental  In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 Axis 	 Bank 	 initiated 	 the 	 sanction 	 process 	 for 	 the 	 acquisition 	 of 	 a 	 thermal 	 asset 	 under 	 NCLT 	 – 	 a 	 project 	 marked 	 as Category A owing to its high  environmental and social (E&S) risk.  In line with our ESG Policy  of 	 Lending 	 and 	 international 	 best 	 practices, 	 we 	 engaged 	 an 	 independent 	 E&S 	 consulting 	 support to conduct enhanced due  diligence prior to loan disbursement.

Har raah  dil se open Case Study Going  beyond  ESG Policy  for Critical  Sectors  In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 Axis 	 Bank 	 initiated 	 the 	 sanction 	 process 	 for 	 a 	 project 	 in the water–intensive sector and  high–pollution 	 paper 	 sector. 	 Although 	 the proposal was not within the  scope of ESG Policy of Lending of the  Bank, 	 the 	 critical 	 environmental 	 risks 	 associated with the sector prompted  an enhanced review. The Bank opted  to go beyond policy requirement to  undertake a thorough site visit to  assess the Company’s environmental  and social (E&S) performance  firsthand. 	 This 	 included 	 evaluating 	 water 	 use, 	 effluent 	 management, 	 and 	 compliance 	 with 	 pollution 	 control norms. This 	 proactive 	 approach 	 reflects 	 Axis 	 Bank’s evolving ESG risk framework,  where materiality of impact, rather  than policy thresholds alone, guides  decision–making. It reinforces the  Bank’s commitment to responsible  lending, especially in environmentally  sensitive 	 sectors. Scaling the Green Wholesale  Portfolio We 	 are 	 continuously 	 working 	 to 	 expand 	 our 	 Wholesale 	 Banking 	 lending 	 portfolio 	 in 	 sustainable 	 sectors, 	 including 	 renewable 	 energy 	 generation, 	 urban 	 mass 	 transport, 	 electric mobility, and green infrastructure.

The target for Wholesale  Banking was achieved in  fiscal 2024 itself whereas, for  the Retail two–wheeler loan  portfolio target was till fiscal  2024. The Bank then took on  a revised targets in this fiscal  for Wholesale Banking and EV  Wheels which are articulated  along with its achievement in  fiscal 2025 below: Revised Target Fiscal 2025 Achievements 60,000  crores Incremental financial under  Wholesale Banking to sectors  with positive social and  environmental outcomes by  fiscal 2030 (from fiscal 2021) ~₹48,412  crores sanctioned 6 % Two–Wheeler (2W) loan  portfolio by fiscal 2027* 4 % Increase in share of EV revenue  (₹) in Four–Wheeler (4W)  passenger loan portfolio    by fiscal 2027* 7.14 % penetration for two–wheeler 2.92 % penetration for four–wheeler *Penetration 	 target 	 for 	 each 	 fiscal 	 in 	 4W 	 and 	 2W 	 segments 	 respectively Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 172 

Decarbonising our  Lending Portfolio Under the oversight of our ESG  Committee, 	 we 	 are 	 reducing 	 our 	 exposure to carbon–intensive  sectors like thermal power and  coal within our Wholesale Banking  portfolio 	 in 	 alignment 	 with 	 India’s 	 Net 	 Zero 	 ambitions. 	 At 	 this 	 moment 	 this is an internal commitment and  progress made over a glide path that  is 	 in 	 place 	 till 	 2030 	 is 	 reviewed 	 by 	 the 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 of 	 the 	 Board 	 and the Bank’s leadership.

At 	 the 	 same 	 time, 	 it 	 is 	 important 	 for 	 the 	 energy 	 transition 	 to 	 be 	 just 	 and 	 equitable, 	 particularly 	 for 	 vulnerable 	 sections 	 and 	 communities. Impetus to Retail EV  Financing In 	 fiscal 	 2021, 	 the 	 Bank 	 had 	 taken 	 a target, to have 5% of our retail  two–wheeler 	 loan 	 portfolio 	 (in 	 rupee 	 value) in electric by March 2024.   We 	 improved 	 our 	 product 	 offerings 	 and 	 incentives 	 to 	 boost 	 this 	 growing 	 sector. 	 Last 	 fiscal, 	 the 	 cumulative 	 percentage of EV loans stood at  3.62% of the total two–wheeler loan  portfolio 	 since 	 October 	 2021, 	 when 	 the Bank began EV two–wheeler  loans as a product. In 2021, we  were 	 thus 	 starting 	 from 	 a 	 very 	 small 	 nominator. When compared against  12,704 EV loans offered in    fiscal 2025 another industry–prevalent metric  – percentage of EV sales per month,  the Bank had performed well. For  example, 	 EV 	 sales 	 penetration 	 was 	 above 5% in 9 of the 12 months in  fiscal 	 2024, 	 and 	 at 	 5.53% 	 for 	 the 	 entire 	 financial 	 year. In 	 this 	 fiscal, 	 the 	 Bank 	 relooked 	 at 	 this target and decided to take on the  below targets:   » Increasing share of electric vehicle  revenue (INR) in Two–Wheeler loan  portfolio 	 – 	 6% 	 by 	 2027   » Increasing share of electric vehicle  revenue (INR) in Four–Wheeler  passenger 	 loan 	 portfolio 	 – 	 4% 	 by 2027 Against which the Bank has achieved  7.14% 	 penetration 	 for 	 2–wheeler 	 and 	 2.92% 	 penetration 	 for 	 4–wheeler 	 respectively 	 in 	 FY 	 2024–25. 	 The 	 Bank 	 continues 	 to 	 offer 	 a 	 sector–leading 	 up 	 to 0.5% interest rate discount for retail  customers in the EV segment. Special  offering 	 for 	 certain 	 OEMs 	 with 	 an 	 increased payout helped increase the  EV 	 penetration 	 in 	 the 	 market. 	 Special deals with select OEMs and  higher payouts have also supported  greater 	 EV 	 adoption. 	 We 	 have 	 proactively 	 scaled 	 up 	 our 	 partnerships 	 and engagements with EV dealers,  manufacturers, and other players in  the commercial EV space, which is also  influenced 	 by 	 factors 	 such 	 as 	 battery 	 technology and the level of subsidies.  The 	 Bank 	 continues 	 to 	 maintain 	 its 	 bullishness on the sector and has  communicated 	 to 	 the 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 its intent to set fresh targets for EV 2  wheeler and 4 wheeler loans.

Policies and Frameworks   A robust set of policies and  frameworks underpins the Bank’s  approach to responsible governance,  guiding decision–making, risk  management, and ethical conduct  across 	 all 	 levels 	 of 	 the 	 organisation. Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct and Ethics  reflects 	 our 	 unwavering 	 dedication 	 to ethical conduct and integrity,  reinforced by our core values. It sets  clear 	 expectations 	 for 	 employee 	 conduct, ensures compliance  with regulatory standards and  provides 	 mechanisms 	 for 	 reporting 	 ethical 	 violations. 	 New 	 hires 	 must 	 acknowledge the Code, while  existing 	 staff 	 annually 	 reaffirm 	 their commitment. Besides the Code of Conduct  (including 	 the 	 Anti–Bribery 	 and 	 Corruption 	 related 	 provisions), 	 policies 	 related 	 to 	 the 	 Prevention 	 of 	 Sexual 	 Harassment (POSH), Whistleblower  Mechanism, 	 Conflict 	 of 	 Interest, 	 and 	 Staff 	 Accountability 	 framework 	 guide 	 employee conduct.  Tax Policy This policy ensures the Bank handles  its 	 tax 	 affairs 	 responsibly, 	 complies 	 with 	 relevant 	 laws, 	 and 	 fulfils 	 its 	 disclosure 	 obligations 	 in 	 keeping 	 with 	 international 	 standards 	 such 	 as 	 the OECD guidelines. It aligns tax  management with the Bank’s business  strategy to support long–term value  creation 	 and 	 maintain 	 a 	 strong, 	 responsible 	 taxpayer 	 profile. Whistleblower and    Vigil Mechanism We 	 maintain 	 a 	 zero–tolerance 	 policy 	 for breaches of our Code of Conduct  and Ethics. Our Whistleblower Policy  and vigil mechanism encourage  employees to report any illegal,  unethical, or inappropriate conduct,  ensuring 	 the 	 anonymity 	 and 	 protection 	 of the whistleblower. Complaints can  be reported anonymously through our  dedicated 	 web–based 	 platform.

Key 	 initiatives 	 include 	 conducting 	 the 	 Vigilance 	 Awareness 	 Week, 	 annual 	 staff 	 declarations, 	 upholding 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 Anti–Bribery 	 and 	 Anti–Corruption 	 Policy 	 online, 	 training, 	 and ensuring service providers uphold  vigilance standards. Conflict of Interest Policy The 	 Conflict 	 of 	 Interest 	 Policy 	 identifies, 	 prevents, 	 and 	 manages 	 conflicts 	 between 	 employees 	 and 	 stakeholders. Employees are advised to  avoid 	 business 	 with 	 relatives, 	 prioritise 	 the Bank’s interests, and report  conflicts 	 to 	 the 	 Ethics 	 Department. Human Rights Our approach is guided by our Human  Rights Policy, which aligns with  international 	 human 	 rights 	 frameworks 	 established by the UN, ILO, and OECD.  We have established systems and  procedures in place to prevent human  rights 	 violations 	 across 	 our 	 operations. 	 Compliance Compliance is a key pillar of Axis Bank’s  corporate governance, reinforced by  Board–approved policies and a  zero–tolerance 	 approach 	 to 	   non–compliance. 	 In 	 collaboration 	   with 	 Risk 	 and 	 Internal 	 Audit 	 functions, 	 the Compliance department  proactively 	 manages 	 regulatory 	 risks, guides business units, and uses  tech tools to strengthen oversight.  A group governance framework  ensures that subsidiaries align with  the Bank’s standards. The Group Chief  Compliance 	 Officer 	 (GCCO) 	 oversees 	 consistent compliance across the  group 	 through 	 structured 	 reporting 	 and monitoring. Note: 	 Detailed 	 information 	 on 	 all 	 our policies, including the ones  mentioned 	 above, 	 can 	 be 	 accessed 	 on our website at    https://www.axisbank.com/ shareholders-corner/corporate- governance Subsidiary Governance Axis Bank oversees its subsidiaries  to ensure they adhere to corporate  governance principles. The Bank is  committed 	 to 	 continuously 	 improving 	 internal controls and overseeing  its subsidiaries as a Financial  Conglomerate (FC).  To ensure the alignment of governance  practices 	 at 	 the 	 Group 	 (Axis 	 Bank 	 and 	 its 	 subsidiaries) 	 level 	 and 	 to 	 positively 	 engage the Group, the Bank has  established a Subsidiary Governance  Committee 	 (SGC). 	 This 	 committee 	 also helps implement the ‘One Axis’  theme 	 by 	 sharing 	 uniform 	 practices 	 and building synergies between Group  entities. 	 Additionally, 	 along 	 with 	 SGC, 	 all 	 matters 	 of 	 subsidiary 	 governance 	 are 	 overseen 	 by 	 the 	 executive 	 committees, 	 the 	 Enterprise 	 Risk 	 Management 	 Committee 	 (EGRMC) 	   and the Board of the Bank. The 	 Bank 	 continues 	 to 	 undertake 	 several 	 initiatives 	 to 	 strengthen 	 the Governance Framework under  the supervision of the SGC. The  framework also helps align key  organisation 	 functions, 	 such 	 as 	 Risk, Compliance, Audit, Human  Resources, 	 Finance, 	 Information 	 Technology, Cyber Security, Legal,  Corporate 	 Communication, 	 Marketing, 	 and Corporate Secretarial across  the Group.  ESG Governance The Bank’s establishment of the  standalone 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 in 	 2021, 	   a pioneering move in the Indian  banking 	 sector, 	 reflects 	 its 	 deep–seated 	 commitment to Environmental, Social,  and Governance (ESG) principles. The  ESG 	 committee 	 drives 	 initiatives 	 in 	 alignment with the Bank’s purpose  statement—banking 	 for 	 a 	 more 	 inclusive 	 and equitable economy, fostering a  thriving community and    a healthier planet.  The 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 of 	 the 	 Board 	 is 	 supported by a management–level ESG  Steering 	 Committee 	 and 	 ESG 	 Working 	 Group to drive Sustainable Financing  initiatives. 	 The 	 Bank 	 has 	 in 	 place 	 a 	 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)  Council to shape and drive the Bank’s DEI  priorities. 	 The 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 ensures 	 integration 	 of 	 ESG 	 goals 	 with 	 the 	 Bank’s 	 operations, 	 enhancing 	 stakeholder 	 trust, 	 and establishing Axis Bank as a leader in  sustainable and  ‘open’   banking 	 practices. In 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 the 	 ESG 	 Committee 	 of 	 the 	 Board 	 met 	 four 	 times, 	 reviewing 	 the 	 Bank’s progress towards achieving its  ESG–aligned commitments and providing  guidance 	 on 	 new 	 initiatives 	 and 	 activities. 	 The 	 Bank’s 	 overall 	 ESG–aligned 	 activities, 	 highlights and developments during  the 	 fiscal 	 year, 	 including 	 its 	 progress 	 on 	 its commitments, are published in this  report 	 and 	 the 	 ESG 	 data 	 book 	 fiscal 	 2025, 	 prepared 	 per 	 the 	 <IIRC> 	 and 	 GRI 	 reporting 	 framework.

Corporate governance Committee Member ESG Committee Chairman Prof. S. Mahendra Dev Independent Director G. Padmanabhan  Independent Director Amitabh Chaudhry   MD & CEO Fraud Risk Management    The Bank’s governance framework  for fraud risk management integrates  advanced methodologies and strategic  oversight to prevent, detect, and  mitigate 	 fraud 	 risks. 	 The 	 Financial 	 Crime Intelligence (FCI) unit is  central 	 to 	 our 	 operations, 	 ensuring 	 transparency and security in every  customer 	 interaction. 	 The 	 unit 	 leverages 	 cutting–edge 	 technology, 	 real–time 	 analytics, 	 and 	 robust 	 internal 	 controls to build a fraud–resistant  environment. 	 We 	 aim 	 to 	 position 	 the 	 Bank as the most preferred banking  choice for customers and the least  attractive 	 option 	 for 	 fraudsters. Key Initiatives of the FCI Unit  The Bank is focusing on enhancing  fraud 	 prevention 	 capabilities 	 through 	 streamlined yet secure onboarding,  advanced technologies to combat  cyber threats like phishing and  transaction 	 laundering, 	 and 	 cross– authentication 	 methods 	 for 	 enhanced 	 security. 	 Real–time 	 anomaly 	 detection 	 helps prevent account takeovers, while  proactive 	 measures 	 address 	 mule 	 account 	 fraud. 	 Strong 	 collaboration 	 with law enforcement and the Indian  Cyber 	 Crime 	 Coordination 	 Centre 	 (I4C) 	 enables 	 swift 	 action 	 against 	 cyber 	 fraud. 	 Enhanced 	 staff 	 monitoring 	 and 	 targeted training reinforce internal  controls and fraud resilience. Fraud awareness and engagement are  necessary to empower customers,  employees, and corporate clients  to 	 identify 	 and 	 mitigate 	 fraud 	 risks. 	 Among 	 the 	 key 	 initiatives 	 in 	 this 	 regard 	 are the following:   » Customer Awareness:  Digital  campaigns (SMS, email, app, social  media), 	 educational 	 blogs 	 and 	 self– service security tools.   » Employee Engagement:  Regular  fraud risk training, leadership  discussions, monthly ‘Sparsh  Pulsate’ sessions, and internal  awareness drives.   » Corporate Client Advisory:   Industry–specific 	 workshops 	 on 	 secure 	 digital 	 practices 	 and 	 cyber 	 threat 	 mitigation.   » Future–ready Fraud Defence:   Enhanced 	 verification 	 via 	 risk–based 	 and 	 multi–factor 	 authentication, 	 AI–driven 	 behavioural 	 analytics, 	 refined 	 fraud 	 algorithms, 	 seamless 	 security 	 integration, 	 stronger 	 onboarding checks, self–service  security 	 dashboards, 	 and 	 real–time 	 anomaly 	 detection.

Risk Governance Framework A robust and comprehensive Risk  Management Framework enables  proactive 	 and 	 comprehensive 	 risk 	 management. It provides guidelines  for managing various risks, including  credit, 	 liquidity, 	 market, 	 operational, 	 compliance 	 and 	 reputation 	 risk. The Board, which is the apex  governing body, has both direct  and 	 indirect 	 responsibilities 	 for 	 risk oversight, which are exercised  through the Risk Management  Committee 	 (RMC) 	 of 	 the 	 Board. 	 The principal authority responsible  for risk management, the RMC is  assisted by an independent Risk  function 	 that 	 reports 	 to 	 both 	 the 	 Board and the RMC. The policies and frameworks  approved 	 by 	 the 	 executive 	 committees 	 and 	 the 	 RMC 	 are implemented by the Risk  Management Department (RMD),  headed 	 by 	 the 	 Chief 	 Risk 	 Officer 	 (CRO). The Board, which appoints  the CRO and decides the CRO’s  role 	 and 	 responsibilities, 	 plays 	 a pivotal role in ensuring the  appointee’s independence. The  CRO, who steers the Bank’s risk  management strategy, reports  directly to the MD & CEO. The RMD  operates 	 autonomously 	 and 	 actively 	 participates 	 in 	 critical 	 decision– making forums. Proactive 	 management 	 of 	 focus 	 areas will contribute to a credit–led  growth in the retail space while  maintaining strong focus on cyber  security, technological resilience, and  embedding sustainability through  a robust risk culture. The roadmap  also 	 includes 	 targeted 	 initiatives 	 on 	 managing 	 subsidiary 	 risk, 	 operational 	 risk, vendor risk, fraud risk, digital risk,  and 	 underwriting 	 standards. 	 Successful 	 execution 	 of 	 these 	 measures 	 will 	 enable the Bank to achieve its GPS  objectives 	 sustainably. RISK MANAGEMENT Resilience through purposeful  risk stewardship Governance We maintain a robust  and comprehensive Risk  Management Framework  that empowers  us to identify and  address evolving risks  proactively. Supported  by an independent  Risk function, the  Board maintains a keen  oversight on every aspect  of risk management,  ensuring transparency,  accountability, and  resilience.

Other Components of Risk Management Foundational Pillars of Risk Management Risk Management Approach Our 	 approach 	 to 	 risk 	 management 	 is 	 not 	 just 	 about 	 safeguarding 	 assets, 	 it 	 is 	 about 	 cultivating 	 trust, 	 transparency, 	 and 	 resilience 	 through 	 every 	 decision 	 we 	 make. 	 Built 	 on 	 four 	 foundational 	 pillars, 	 our 	 framework 	 empowers 	 us 	 to 	 anticipate 	 uncertainties, 	 respond 	 proactively, 	 and 	 confidently 	 navigate 	 them. Risk Philosophy Risk Identification and  Mitigation Risk Appetite   and Policies Risk Culture A robust risk culture is  reinforced at all levels.  Our Board and senior  management lead by  example, championing  openness, accountability,  and transparency. The  compliance 	 function 	 and RMD ensure the  culture permeates across  the group. Governance Through vigilant  monitoring, the RMD  remains cognisant of  emerging 	 risks, 	 reporting 	 them 	 on 	 time 	 to 	 the 	 Board 	 and RMC via established  frameworks such as ICAAP  and Risk Dashboards.    In 	 close 	 collaboration 	 with the business units,  RMD 	 ensures 	 effective 	 risk 	 mitigation, 	 fostering 	 a culture where everyone  actively 	 owns 	 and 	 manages 	 risks in their daily roles. Our 	 clearly 	 defined 	 risk 	 appetite, 	 approved by the RMC,  empowers informed    decision–making.    Robust, Board–approved  policies transparently  outline our risk–taking    boundaries. 	 Executive 	 committees 	 and 	 the 	 Risk Management   Department (RMD)  ensure 	 effective   and transparent   implementation. Internal Audit The 	 Bank’s 	 Internal 	 Audit 	 function 	 independently evaluates internal  controls, risk management, and  governance, and reports to the Board on  compliance with internal and regulatory  guidelines. Guided by the RBI’s Risk– Based Internal Audit (RBIA) standards,  the Bank’s audit policy emphasises a  strategic focus on emerging business  risks. A range of audit methodologies  are followed by Internal Audit, which has  also embraced technology–driven audits  to 	 enhance 	 efficiency 	 and 	 effectiveness. 	 Emphasis 	 is 	 laid 	 on 	 continuous 	 skill– building and compliance with guidelines  and established standards to uphold  robust 	 controls, 	 which 	 reflects 	 our 	 commitment to building trust and  openness amongst stakeholders. Business Continuity Plan The 	 Business 	 Continuity 	 Plan 	 (BCP) 	 is 	 overseen 	 by 	 the 	 Business 	 Continuity 	 Planning 	 Management 	 Committee 	 (BCPMC), 	 an 	 executive 	 risk 	 committee 	 mandated 	 by 	 the 	 RMC. 	 The 	 committee 	 ensures 	 effective 	 implementation 	 and 	 testing 	 of 	 the 	 BCP 	 framework 	 across 	 critical 	 internal 	 operations, 	 preparing 	 the 	 Bank to respond seamlessly to various  contingency 	 scenarios. 	 Insights 	 gathered 	 from these tests and exercises are  systematically 	 integrated 	 into 	 the 	 BCP 	 to 	 ensure uninterrupted services and trust– building with customers. Fraud Detection and Mitigation Guided by a comprehensive Fraud Risk  Management Policy, which is reinforced  by established processes, the Bank is  committed 	 to 	 providing 	 robust 	 protection 	 against fraud. An advanced IT system  ensures 	 that 	 transactions 	 are 	 monitored 	 in 	 real–time, 	 ensuring 	 that 	 suspicious 	 activities 	 are 	 immediately 	 detected. 	   An 	 enterprise–wide 	 anti–money 	 laundering 	 (AML) 	 software 	 generates 	 timely 	 alerts, 	 enabling 	 efficient 	 monitoring, 	 investigation, 	 and 	 reporting 	 of 	 potentially 	 fraudulent 	 transactions. 	 A dedicated fraud management system  further strengthens the Bank’s defences  by 	 actively 	 tackling 	 fraudulent 	 activities 	 in 	 credit 	 and 	 debit 	 card 	 transactions. At the Bank, risk is  everyone’s responsibility.  Recognising that trust  is invaluable, we ensure  that compliance and  reputation 	 protection 	 are 	 non–negotiable. 	 This 	 shared responsibility  fosters a culture of  integrity and openness,  where 	 protecting 	 our stakeholders’  interests becomes our  topmost priority. Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 188

Our credit risk management is designed  to maintain asset quality and manage  concentration 	 risks 	 at 	 both 	 individual 	 exposure 	 and 	 portfolio 	 levels. Market 	 risk 	 arises 	 from 	 potential 	 losses 	 in 	 on– 	 and 	 off–balance 	 sheet 	 positions, 	 resulting 	 from 	 market 	 price 	 movements 	 and 	 their 	 associated 	 volatility, 	 which 	 can 	 impact the Bank’s earnings and capital.  This includes interest rate, equity price,  and foreign exchange rates. Our trading  and 	 investment 	 activities, 	 carried 	 out 	 for 	 customers and on a proprietary basis, are  primary sources of market risk. Credit Risk Market Risk Wholesale Banking Internal 	 ratings 	 form 	 the backbone of our  risk management  process, determining  risk acceptance,  maximum exposure  limits, 	 sanctioning 	 authority, pricing, and  review frequency.

Independent Oversight RMD independently  monitors investment and  trading 	 portfolios, 	 ensuring 	 adherence 	 to 	 predefined 	 risk limits and promptly  reporting 	 deviations. Statistical & Non– Statistical Measures The 	 Bank 	 utilises 	 statistical 	 tools, including Value at  KEY MATERIAL RISKS  KEY MATERIAL RISKS  Risk management Retail Banking Product–specific 	 scorecards are used  for retail customers,  including small businesses  and small agriculture  borrowers. An independent  validation 	 team 	 rigorously 	 evaluates these credit  models to ensure robust  discriminatory power,  precise 	 calibration, 	 and 	 long–term stability. Risk (VaR), stress tests, back  tests, and scenario analysis,    as 	 well 	 as 	 non–statistical 	 measures 	 such 	 as 	 position 	 limits, Marked–to–Market  (MTM) 	 evaluations, 	 and 	 stop–loss limits, to manage  risk 	 effectively.

A summary of these assessments is provided below and the complete assessment reports are available on the Bank’s  website at  https://www.axisbank.com/csr/social -responsibility .   Impact Assessment Project 1   Financial Literacy Training Program   Axis Bank’s financial literacy program aims to create awareness on personal financial management aspects through  financial literacy initiatives and provide the underserved sections of society – especially rural population and urban  poor, with access to formal banking channels and products under financial inclusion initiatives. The program also aims  to facilitate access to Government benefit schemes and social security schemes through banking channels. The impact  assessment of the program focuses on the effectiveness of trainings and short video films in local languages as the  primary educational tool.   During fiscal 2023, a total of 0.9 million beneficiaries across 20 states and one Union Territory were provided financial  literacy trainings. The assessment is based on data collected from an exhaustive survey conducted between October  2024 - January 2025, involving 2,326 women who participated in the program and a control group of 488 women from  similar socio-economic backgrounds who did not view the video.   Key Findings:   1.   The program achieved a 100% recall rate among participants, with the majority remembering key messages about  savings and distinguishing essential from non-essential expenditures. In contrast, only 23% of the control group  had similar exposure to financial literacy content. 

Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 226 Statutory reports   2.   77% participants reported tracking their household incomes and expenditures post-training, compared to about  49% in the control group. Additionally, 44% of participants started this practice after watching the FL video,  indicating a direct impact of the program on their financial habits.   3.   Nearly all participants had a savings account, and over 90% were aware of receiving direct benefit transfers from  the government, a significant increase from the control group 86%.   4.   Among the participants, 94% have stated that health insurance is important as against 84% among the control  group respondents.   5.

About 90% of respondents in the participant group have stated that they consider life insurance important as  against the control group 78%. Further, 52% of these participants had some form of life insurance compared to  only 37% of the control group respondents.   7.   The case studies show improved financial awareness, Utilization of Skills for Income Generation, Awareness of  government schemes etc. of the participants.   The Financial Literacy Program has been reasonably successful in raising financial awareness and capability among women  participants. While the program has shown positive results in terms of awareness and behavioural change, there remains a  gap in the actual subscription to financial products like insurance, suggesting a need for further targeted interventions.   Overall, the program significantly enhanced participants’ financial literacy, leading to better financial planning and  security, demonstrating the critical role of such education in empowering individuals economically.   Impact Assessment Project 2   Financial Literacy through Mobile Vans   The Financial Literacy Program, supported by Axis Bank and implemented by CSC Academy, aimed to enhance financial  understanding among rural populations in India using 20 mobile vans operated by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs).  The initiative targeted remote areas, delivering financial education through video content. The impact assessment for  fiscal 2023 covered 18 locations where these vans operated, gathering feedback from 455 participants. The assessment  involved identifying VLEs, surveying locations, conducting interviews with VLEs and participants, and evaluating recall  and understanding of financial literacy concepts.   Key Findings:   1.   High recall was observed for bank account opening procedures (77%), budgeting and financial planning (71%) and  insurance schemes (69%).   2.   Digital literacy topics had lower recall, with UPI app registration at 55% and safe use of digital banking apps at 62%.   3.   Fraud awareness, including Ponzi schemes, had a recall of 69%, indicating a moderate understanding of financial risks.   4.

Topics like using loans for intended purposes (66%) and BHIM app usage (54%) showed lower comprehension,  highlighting gaps in digital financial literacy.   6.

Strengthening VLE training and ensuring better responsiveness can further maximize the program’s success.

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 234 Management’s discussion and analysis Macro-economic Environment Global economy enters a period of structural adjustments The global economic system operational post-World War 2 is currently in the process of being reset. The Trump Administration  has interpreted its political mandate to course-correct on the sharp increase in income and wealth inequality in the US, the  atrophying of its manufacturing base, and what it sees as misuse of multilateral institutions that it helped erect over the past  80 years. The Trump Administration has therefore begun to make structural changes to trade, taxes, regulations, immigration,  currency and energy markets, among others. For example, it believes that existing global trading rules do not work anymore  for the US and need to be dismantled or at least meaningfully amended, moving to bilateral agreements with partners instead  of multilateral forums. However, it is still unclear what the new rules are likely to be, and by when the consensus around them  can be built. Given US-China dominance in global trade, a prolonged conflict would have a substantial impact on global growth. Similarly, the “new Triffin dilemma” necessitates a periodic downward reset of the US dollar. It highlights the risks from the  country providing the global reserve currency needing to sustain a current account deficit, and thus, over decades, accumulating  unsustainable international liabilities. Prior episodes of unilateral hikes in import tariffs, like in 1930 (Smoot-Hawley) and 1971  (the Nixon shock) also drove similar disruptions, and triggered significant currency market volatility. Large changes in exchange  rates unsettle economies and markets. Negotiations on these issues, and evolution of the new models of engagement are likely to be contentious, driving a prolonged  period of policy vacuum. The only restraint on the pace of this shift seems to be market volatility – when uncertainty crosses a  certain level, markets become chaotic. Fear of chaos has driven a pull-back from overly disruptive steps a few times.  Despite partial tariff rollbacks and ongoing negotiations to reduce them, the lack of clarity is likely to significantly slow global  growth as 1) investment decisions will get postponed till visibility improves on tariffs and exchange rates; 2) higher tariffs  mean fiscal tightening, among others driving a cutback in consumption; 3) financial conditions tighten due to uncertainty. There can be some positive surprise for global growth if strong fiscal action materialises across Europe and China, breaking  through the local political resistance. Similarly, an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict can also help improve risk appetite and  push energy prices lower.  Indian economy  In our view, the growth slowdown in the Indian economy in fiscal 2025 was due to fiscal and monetary tightening, much of it  unintended.  There were two sets of challenges fiscally. First, the union government’s fiscal deficit fell by 80 basis points of GDP in each of  fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. Second, while the spending was front-loaded in fiscal 2024, it was back loaded in fiscal 2025, both  due to the general elections. This created a prolonged lull in government. Both these headwinds are now receding. Deficit in  fiscal 2026 is set to fall only 40 bps of GDP, and the spending lull is now over, with seasonal patterns back.  Second, on the monetary front, adjusted for the major merger in the banking system in fiscal 2024, non-food credit growth  fell from 16.5% in March 2024 to 10.9% year-on-year (“Y-o-Y”) in March 2025. This sharp slowdown was broad-based (i.e. not just limited to unsecured loans segment) and largely supply-driven. It was  triggered by the regulator’s concerns on high loan-deposit ratios (LDR) at some banks. As banks slowed credit growth,  deposit creation by banks slowed too, compounding the weak money injection by the RBI. Furthermore, FX intervention  (USD sales by the central bank) drained durable liquidity by around  ` 5 lakh crore, and intensified the liquidity stress, with  rates on certificates of deposit diverging substantially from the expected policy rates.  Recent steps by the RBI, like a CRR cut, bond purchases, buy-sell FX swaps, repo rate cuts, macroprudential easing and easier  LCR norms have led to conditions that should support growth better. Inflation falling below 4% means the policy focus now is  squarely on growth.   

Management’s discussion and analysis 235 India’s economy is among the least exposed to global factors, with direct impact from initial US reciprocal tariffs among the  least in the world. There is some potential for share gains as well, as the “China + 1” trend gets another impetus. Improving  competitive metrics, like in infrastructure and value-chain development in electronics, are likely to help. India’s services  exports, particularly in the global capability centres, continue to be robust. The structural drivers behind this – disaggregation  of global services value-chains, rapid increase in global cross-border telecom bandwidth, and the surge in remote-working – are  likely to persist. India’s share of modern services exports is now a remarkable 8%. However, uncertainty on global growth may  adversely affect some sectors of the economy in the near-term.  Developments in the Banking system Adjusted for a major merger in the financial system, banking system non-food credit grew 10.9% Y-o-Y as of 4 April, 2025,  while deposit growth was up 10.1% Y-o-Y.  Credit growth continues to be dominated by services (this includes credit to NBFCs), followed by the retail segment. While  credit to agriculture is strong, industry segment growth has stayed subdued. Within industry, growth in MSMEs continues to  be faster than large corporates.  Regulators have rolled back risk weights on bank lending to NBFCs and MFIs which should contribute to the overall banking  system growth going forward.  The banking system remains well capitalized to meet the needs of a growing economy, with early signs of growth in private  investments, and credit risks remain subdued.  Prospects for fiscal 2026  A revival in the domestic real-estate market, and in general the reversal of several headwinds that slowed the economy last  year should be supportive of credit demand. With liquidity conditions easing supply, and transmission of rate cuts underway,  credit growth should pick up from current levels. The high uncertainty emanating from US trade policies and financial market  shocks may push out corporate investments and keep their loan demand weak.  Medium term Outlook Over the past decade, consensus estimates for India’s trend growth rate declined from around 8% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal  2012 to the current range of 6-6.5%. COVID cast new shadows on potential trend growth. We believe the growth slowdown  in the previous decade was due to cyclical factors, in particular the real-estate downturn, and trend growth remains above 7%.  This consists of: a) 1% annual growth in labour input, as the number of workers of working age continues to expand, and female  labour force participation and hours worked should rise; b) 2% to 2.5% annual growth in total-factor-productivity due to the  state still willingly ceding space to the private sector, strong productivity growth in services, improvement in macro (highways,  railways) as well as micro-infrastructure (like piped water, internet, electricity and cooking gas connections), and technology  transfer emanating from the surge in global capability centres; and c) 4%-plus growth in capital formation due to a cyclical  recovery in real-estate and private sector capex. We expect inflation to average 4% in fiscal 2026 as the economy remains  nearly a year behind its pre-pandemic path, keeping labour in surplus.  With nominal GDP growth likely to average 11% annually, and the formal economy expected to grow faster, system bank credit  growth can be in the low to mid-teens.

Provisions and contingencies  increased by 91% from  ` 4,063 crores in fiscal 2024 to  ` 7,759 crores in fiscal 2025. Consequently, net profit increased by 6%  Y-o-Y from  ` 24,861 crores in fiscal 2024 to  ` 26,373 crores in fiscal 2025.

Yield on assets increased by 7 bps while cost of funds increased by 21 bps. As a result, the NIM declined 9 bps  Y-o-Y to 3.98% in fiscal 2025. During this period, the yield on interest earning assets increased from 8.92% in fiscal 2024 to 8.99% in fiscal 2025 largely  due to improved mix of better yielding assets in the Balance  S heet. The yield on advances decreased marginally by 3 bps  from 9.89% in fiscal 2024 to 9.86% in fiscal 2025. The decrease in yield on advances is mainly due to increase in interest  reversals due to higher slippages. ~72% of the loans of the Bank are floating rate loans, linked to external/internal benchmark  rates. Repo rate has decreased from 6.50% in fiscal 2024 to 6.25% in February 2025.  The yield on investments increased  by 14 bps during fiscal 2025.  The decrease in share of low cost bearing liabilities along with repricing of the term deposits during the course of the year has led  to higher cost of funds. As a result, the cost of funds increased by 21 bps from 5.25% in fiscal 2024 to 5.46% in fiscal 2025. Cost  of deposits increased to 5.12% from 4.86% last fiscal mainly due to increase in funding cost of term deposits. Daily average CASA  ratio as a proportion to deposits decreased by 328 bps in fiscal 2025 to 39.26% from 42.54% in fiscal 2024.  Performance of the Bank against the key drivers for the NIM improvement journey of the Bank in fiscal 2025 is as follows: •   Improvement in Balance Sheet mix: loans and investments comprised 89% of total assets as at the end of fiscal 2025,  improving 149 bps Y-o-Y; •   INR denominated loans comprised 96% of total advances at the end of fiscal 2025, stable Y-o-Y; •   Retail and CBG advances comprised 71% of total advances as at 31 March, 2025, improving  5 bps Y-o-Y;  

Management’s discussion and analysis 237 •     Balance outstanding in low-yielding priority sector shortfall deposits declined by  ` 7,107 crores Y-o-Y with  priority sector short fall deposits comprising 0.90% of total assets as at 31 March, 2025 as compared to 1.46% at    31 March, 2024; •   Quality of liabilities measured by outflow rate improved ~340 bps over last three years, month end CASA% at 41% at    31 March, 2025 continues to be amongst the highest in the large private sector banks universe. The Bank also earned interest on income tax refund of  ` 369 crores in fiscal 2025 as compared to  ` 75 crores in fiscal 2024.  The receipt, amount and timing of such income depends on the nature and determinations by tax authorities and is hence  neither consistent nor predictable.

Fee income increased by 11% to  ` 22,504 crores from  ` 20,257  crores last year and continued to remain a significant part of the  Bank’s non-interest income. It constituted 89% of non-interest  income and contributed 28% to the operating revenue in fiscal  2025.  Growth in reported fee income was mainly on account of  increase in business across segments.  Segmental composition of fee income continued to remain stable Y-o-Y as under - Particulars 2024-25 2023-24 Retail Banking  72% 72% Wholesale Banking  25% 25% Commercial Banking  3% 3% Retail Banking fees constituted 72% of the total fee income of the Bank in fiscal 2025 and grew strongly at 12% on a Y-o-Y  basis.

The Bank provided  ` 11,356  crores towards non-performing assets compared to  ` 6,453 crores last year. The increase in provision for non-performing  assets is primarily on account of higher net slippage ratio at 1.16% in fiscal 2025 as compared to  0.64% crores in fiscal 2024.  The Bank’s recoveries from written off accounts in fiscal 2025 was higher, amounting to  ` 3,809 crores as against  ` 2,773  crores in fiscal 2024.

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 244 BUSINESS OVERVIEW In 2019, we launched our ‘Growth Profitability and Sustainability’ strategy, also known as the ‘House of GPS’. Over the years,  as part of annual reviews of the House of GPS, we have added areas of distinctiveness, key themes for the Bank to focus  on and other changes to reflect the priorities of the Bank and accounting for the changing environment. The House of GPS,  as it stands today, continues to reflect our aspirations and remain relevant. Our overall strategy, and specific business and  function strategies, are aligned with our core philosophy of GPS – •   Growth:  Accelerate deposits growth, focus on profitable advances, achievement of leadership positions across our  focus areas, drive One Axis-led growth across the Group and scale-up of subsidiaries and Axis Digital Bank •   Profitability:  Focus on profitability and NIM, growth in fee income, improve operating efficiency, optimise costs,  strengthen collections infrastructure and maintain control over credit cost •   Sustainability:  Strengthen governance across the Group with an integrated assurance approach to enhance risk  management, robust audit and compliance culture, retain high-quality talent, strengthen underwriting, technology and  analytical capabilities and a robust operations platform As part of the GPS initiatives, under the ‘One Axis’ vision, we are focused on creating a ‘one-stop’ solution for banking needs  by integrating the strengths of the subsidiaries with the Bank. We have several noteworthy achievements in fiscal 2025. Our best-in-class mobile banking application, digital/analytical  capabilities, and emerging technology, such as generative AI, gives us the right to win in digital banking. The Bank focuses on  reimagining end-to-end journeys, transforming the core and becoming a partner of choice for ecosystems. We successfully  completed integrating Citi’s consumer business in July 2024. While the macro-economic environment continues to evolve  amidst geo-political uncertainties, India remains a bright economic spot, giving us an incredible opportunity to tap into  the growing capex/infrastructure/investment boom. We have a self-sustaining capital structure with our CET-1 accretion  adequate to fund organic growth. Our transformation projects have enabled us to reach closer to our GPS ambitions –  ‘Neo for Business’ (offers end-to-end digital journeys with DIY onboarding, for banking as well as beyond-banking needs  of MSMEs), ‘Siddhi’ (a super app that empowers our colleagues to engage seamlessly with customers), granularisation and  premiumisation of liability franchise, focus on cost optimisation, drive collections transformation and set up next generation  collections architecture for the Bank. We have also started yielding visible results due to our investments in long-term  ‘distinctiveness’ drivers – ‘Digital 2.0’ (becoming India’s Best Tech Bank), Bharat Banking (tapping the high growth potential  in rural and semi-urban markets), ‘Sparsh’ (customer obsession program to aid improvement in NPS rankings). We remain committed to our GPS strategy of working towards Growth, Profitability and Sustainability over the medium- term and aim to become a resilient, all-weather franchise. Retail Banking The Bank has over the last decade built a strong Retail Banking franchise that continues to be a key driver of the Bank’s overall  growth strategy. The Bank’s focused customer-centric approach, strong and differentiated product offerings, along with its  wide distribution network remain the core pillars through which it continues to serve the financial needs and aspirations of  its customers. The Retail business segment provides a complete bouquet of products across deposits, transaction services, wealth  management and lending products for retail customers, small businesses, NRIs (non-resident Indians) and retail institutions,  backed by innovative, digital-first solutions. The Bank offers a wide range of retail liability products, including savings accounts, current accounts, fixed deposits, recurring  deposits, and other customized deposit options, catering to the diverse needs of customers. Retail lending products include  home loans, loans against property, automobile loans, two-wheeler loans, commercial vehicle loans, personal loans, gold  loans, education loans, credit cards, small business banking loans and agriculture loans among others. The Bank’s Retail Banking business unit also offers other products and services such as debit and credit cards, forex cards,  bill payment services and wealth management services. The Bank also distributes third party products such as mutual funds,  life and non-life insurance policies, Government bonds, etc. 

Management’s discussion and analysis 245 The Bank’s strategy in Retail has been to gain a larger share of the wallet of existing customers, acquire quality new customers,  and deliver a best-in-class experience, thus building customer loyalty. In line with its customer centric approach, the Bank  continued its strong focus on holistic customer lifecycle management, led by its strong data analytics and technology, to  engage in meaningful conversations and provide the right product proposition. The Bank has made strong progress in  digitization of sales, service, and branch operations to offer seamless and intelligent banking experience to its customers. The Bank believes that it is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the Indian retail financial services market,  led by its strong liability franchise, well diversified products portfolio and robust data analytics and technological capabilities. During the fiscal year 2025, the Retail segment contributed 73% to the Bank’s deposits in the form of CASA and Retail Term  Deposits; 60% to the Bank’s advances and 72% to the Bank’s fee income. Retail Deposits The Bank has made significant progress in key areas, particularly in acquiring savings accounts (SA). The acquisition channels  have become more self-sufficient, resulting in a 13%  Y-o-Y growth in Retail SA. By strategically increasing the average ticket  size in metro and urban markets, there was a 17% Y-o-Y increase in the average ticket size. Additionally, efforts to attract  premium customers led to a 140 basis points rise in the share of premium customers. New-to-bank (NTB) salary uploads  improved by 18% Y-o-Y. Operational improvements also contributed significantly to growth. Over 50 process enhancements reduced the account  opening turnaround time from 7 days to 3 days, improving onboarding efficiency. The increased use of the “Siddhi” App,  seamless cross-sell journeys, and smart nudges enhanced the overall ease of doing business for both customers and  employees. Furthermore, the introduction of an effort-based credit architecture for term deposit led to a 41% increase in  inflows for March, 2025. The focus on premiumization of deposits will continue by increasing the share of premium accounts in overall acquisitions,  targeting high-value customers. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we have shifted towards premiumization in  mass market variants, focusing on high-value customer segments while reducing reliance on lower-variant offerings in  metro and urban branches. This strategy aligns with market dynamics and our commitment to enhancing profitability  and brand positioning. We aim to further strengthen our premium product portfolio, leverage technology, and enhance  customer experiences. This strategic focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and establish leadership in the  premium banking segment. We have also streamlined processes by reducing friction points, enhancing digital journeys, and  empowering service channels like phone banking, leading to fewer complaints and improved Net Promoter Scores (NPS). The  Bank maintained a steady share of CASA deposits at 41% of total deposits at the end of fiscal 2025. The Corporate Salary Suvidha proposition has been further explored to make better inroads into corporate clients. Key  requirements for corporates wanting to disburse reimbursements to their employees were activated both physically and  digitally through Employee Reimbursement Accounts, ensuring easy and quick conversions compared to paper-based accounts.  Worksites in corporates were transformed and innovated beyond the traditional helpdesk approach. We added brand  partnerships with the largest electric two-wheeler companies, multinational electronics, and consumer durable companies for  deeper employee engagement at worksites and induction programs. We also launched a Special Suvidha Masterclass series with curated topics such as digital fraud prevention, tax filing, succession  planning, financial and estate planning, and will writing through virtual sessions for employees in top corporates. The Bank continues to focus on fraud prevention and regulatory features, strengthening the onboarding mechanism with  thorough verification of customer details via NSDL and UIDAI checks, complete authentication of customer contact details,  enhanced customer profiling checks, and redesigning the geo-tagging process for address verification. Digital banking is enhancing the retail liabilities franchise by enabling the Bank to source more accounts through seamless  onboarding, personalized offerings, and data-driven engagement. Additionally, digital banking strengthens the overall  customer relationship value by integrating savings, investments, and lending products into a unified experience, fostering long- term loyalty and higher wallet share. In the transformational space centered around customer experience, the Bank launched a Lean Digital Savings Onboarding  journey for existing assets and payments customers, where all their demographic details and Know-your-customer (KYC)  

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 246 are pre-filled in the savings application, and only incremental or missing details are fetched from the customer along with  the necessary initial funding. In the assisted mobile-based onboarding space, the Bank is an early adopter of UIDAI’s facial  recognition technology-based KYC, allowing customers to be onboarded based on face match with customer records in the  Aadhar repository. The Bank also enabled a savings application tracker that allows customers to check real-time updates and  status of the savings application from submission to account activation seamlessly. The Bank continued to focus on retail term deposits throughout the year by leveraging new individual customers through its  strong acquisition channels. This was complemented by the revamp of its journeys on digital channels, such as the ability to  book fixed deposits (FD) from outside funds and booking non-callable FDs online. Individual current account (CA) customers  can now seamlessly book FDs via WhatsApp. Total term deposits increased by 14% Y-o-Y in fiscal 2025. During the year, the Bank introduced several new product propositions, including the ‘ARISE’ savings account for women and  the Doctors Banking Program, to offer the best banking services and life experiences under one bouquet. Premiumization of  the deposits franchise continues to be an important imperative for the bank. ARISE Savings Account During the year, the Bank launched the ARISE savings account, a thoughtfully designed proposition for women seeking  financial security, independence, and growth. Women customers have always been at the forefront of disciplined saving,  often maintaining higher balances in fixed deposits and mutual funds. With ARISE, we aim to not only enhance our deposit focus but also provide a product that caters to women’s unique financial  needs, whether they are balancers securing their family’s future, simplicity seekers building emergency funds, or go-getters  with long-term saving goals. When we solve for women, we solve for everyone. Doctors Banking Program In line with the premiumization strategy of the Bank, we launched a Doctors Banking Program specifically targeting doctors  as a micro-segment, which constitutes a high-income cohort. We intend to take a holistic “One Axis” proposition to them  with this program, catering to all their needs comprehensively and increasing cross-selling opportunities for the Bank,  thereby building stickiness with these customers. Branch Banking To   serve the customers better and deepen relationships with them, the Bank has organically built a well-diversified branch  network over the years. The Bank continues to look at the segments and demographic areas that are relevant to the Retail  Banking strategy, before setting up a branch. The new branch additions have been balanced and well diversified across  Metro and Urban locations and RuSu (Rural and Semi Urban) regions as the Bank continues to focus on improving the market  share across districts led by micro market focused approach. During fiscal 2025, the Bank crossed a milestone of 5,800 branches as it opened 500 new branches, thereby reinforcing its  commitment towards making banking solutions accessible to diversified segments of customers. As on 31 March, 2025, the  Bank had a network of 6,265 branch banking outlets with 5,865 branches, 3 Digital Banking Units, 11 extension counters,  152 specialised branches (lending centers) and 234 Business Correspondent and Banking Outlets (BCBO). The Bank also has  extensive network of 13,941 ATMs and Recyclers, which not only handle the cash deposits and withdrawals, but also serve  as self-service and fulfilment centres. The Bank’s geographical reach in India now extends to 692 districts across 28 states  and 7 union territories. The Bank promotes a fair and equitable relationship between the Bank and its customers. The Bank treats all customers fairly  and does not discriminate customers on any grounds such as gender, age, religion, caste, literacy, economic status, or physical  disability. To cater to the needs of “persons with disabilities”, the Bank has enabled its ATMs with braille keypad and talking  functionality (voice guidance). In respect of Bank branches which are not easily accessible, ramps are constructed wherever  feasible, for facilitating access to persons with disabilities. Adequate seating arrangements and support for banking services  are provided. Certain large offices have special equipment, such as stretchers and wheelchairs for ease of movement. We  also provide doorstep banking for ease of operations for senior citizens and persons with disabilities. Customers in need of  assistance can contact the designated officer at their branch or may bring it to the notice of the Nodal Officer. 

Management’s discussion and analysis 247 Retail Lending Retail lending continues to be a high growth sector in India, driven by a large affluent customer base, a young population, and  growing needs of the Indian consumer. The Bank’s retail loan book exhibited well diversified growth across the portfolio. Throughout the fiscal year, the Bank  focused on driving growth in prioritized products and preferred customer segments, which was facilitated by its advanced  analytics-driven underwriting and comprehensive risk management framework. The Bank’s retail lending strategy is focused on deepening relationships with the existing-to-bank (ETB) customers via its  branch network and digital platforms, while also focusing on select segments to drive new-to-bank volumes. The Bank has embarked on multiple transformation projects across product segments to introduce end-to-end digital  journeys for customer onboarding across channels, enhance customer experience, improve employee productivity, and  reduce turnaround times. Siddhi , the Bank’s comprehensive mobile platform, now supports the entire frontline retail lending team, enabling faster loan  application processing, while offering a holistic view of the customer to the sales architecture, and a tightened sales rhythm  to drive productivity. The Bank’s mortgages segment comprising of Home Loans and Loans against Property (LAP) delivered sustained growth,  with improving profit metrics in fiscal 2025. During the year, the Bank made progress in its Digital Home Loan journeys by  providing real-time sanctions to customers at builder sites.

For example, Risk function is  a permanent invitee to all credit sanctioning committees in the wholesale banking space, Risk function convenes and  conducts meetings of executive risk committees etc. •   The Risk function is well staffed in terms of people and has independent access to data needed to support its working. The Risk Department, while discharging its role, first lays down risk policies which are then approved by the Board of  Directors, and then monitors the risk profile of the Bank across various components of risk in line with these policies and  also informs and escalates matters of concern to the appropriate levels of management. Risk Appetite The overall risk appetite and philosophy of the Bank is approved by the Risk Management Committee of the Bank. The Risk Appetite Statement and the framework thereof provides guidance to the management on the desired level of risk  for various types of risks in the long term and helps steer critical portfolio decisions. The Risk Appetite is set at the Bank level and is cascaded into the business units for driving decisions at an operational level.  It is monitored by the Risk Department which reports on the adherence thereto to the senior management and also to the  Risk Management Committee. Risk Culture A robust operational risk and compliance culture is the cornerstone for risk management in any institution. In the Bank,  Risk Department along with Compliance Department has put in place an action plan to strengthen the risk and compliance  culture. This includes various initiatives such as - 

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 264 •   Training and awareness programs •   Strengthening staff accountability framework •   Clarity on roles and responsibilities of the front line staff •   Tone from the top through communication from the MD & CEO Risk Architecture The risk architecture is composed, for every type of risk, of elements of - •   Governance with executive risk committee oversight •   Risk policies to provide guidance •   Tools for measuring risk level •   Monitoring of risk profile •   Reporting for actioning A summary of these facets of the key risks is provided here: Risk type Definition Approach to risk management Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a  customer, borrower, issuer of securities that  the Bank holds, or any other counterparty  fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises from all transactions that  give rise to actual, contingent, or potential  claims against any counterparty, customer,  borrower or obligor. The goal of credit risk management is to maintain asset quality and  concentrations at individual exposures as well as at the portfolio level. Internal rating forms the core of the risk management process for  wholesale lending businesses with internal ratings determining the  acceptability of risk, maximum exposure ceiling, sanctioning authority,  pricing decisions and review frequency. For the retail portfolio including  small businesses and small agriculture borrowers, the Bank uses different  product-specific scorecards. Credit models used for risk estimation  are assessed for their discriminatory power, calibration accuracy and  stability, independently by a validation team. Both credit and market risk expertise are combined to manage risks  arising out of traded credit products such as bonds and market related  off-balance sheet transactions. Market risk Market risk is the risk of losses in ‘on and  off-balance sheet’ positions arising from  the movements in market price as well as  the volatilities of those changes, which may  impact the Bank’s earnings and capital. The  risk may pertain to interest rate related  instruments (interest rate risk), equities  (equity price risk) and foreign exchange rate  risk (currency risk). Market risk for the Bank  emanates from its trading and investment  activities, which are undertaken both for the  customers and on a proprietary basis. The Bank adopts a comprehensive approach to market risk management  for its banking book as well as its trading book for both its domestic  and overseas operations. The market risk management framework of the  Bank covers inputs regarding the extent of market risk exposures, the  performance of portfolios vis-à-vis the market risk limits and comparable  benchmarks which provide guidance to the business in optimizing  the risk-adjusted rate of return of the Bank’s trading and investment  portfolio. Market risk management is guided by clearly laid down policies,  guidelines, processes and systems for the identification, measurement,  monitoring and reporting of exposures against various risk limits set  in accordance with the risk appetite of the Bank. Risk Department  independently monitors the Bank’s investment and trading portfolio in  terms of risk limits stipulated in the Market Risk Management Policy  and board approved Market Risk Appetite and reports deviations, if  any, to the appropriate authorities as laid down in the policy and in the  Risk Appetite Statement. The Bank utilises both statistical as well as  non-statistical measures for the market risk management of its trading  and investment portfolios. The statistical measures include Value at  Risk (VaR), stress tests, back tests and scenario analysis while position  limits, marked-to-market (MTM), stop-loss limits, trigger limits, gaps and  sensitivities (duration, PVBP, option greeks) are used as non-statistical  measures of market risk management. 

Management’s discussion and analysis 265 Risk type Definition Approach to risk management The Bank follows a historical simulation approach to calculate Value at  Risk (VaR) with a 99% confidence level for a one-day holding period in  a time horizon of 250 days. VaR models for different portfolios are back  tested on an ongoing basis and the results are used to maintain and  improve the efficacy of the model. VaR measurements are supplemented  with a series of stress tests and sensitivity analyses as per a well laid out  stress testing framework. Liquidity risk Liquidity is a bank’s capacity to fund increase  in assets and meet both expected and  unexpected cash and collateral obligations  at a reasonable cost and without incurring  unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk is the  inability of a bank to meet such obligations  as they become due, without adversely  affecting the Bank’s financial condition. The Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy of the Bank stipulates a  broad framework for liquidity risk management to ensure that the Bank  is in a position to meet its liquidity obligations as well as to withstand  a period of liquidity stress from bank-level factors, market-wide factors  or a combination of both. The ALM policy captures the liquidity risk  appetite of the Bank and related governance structures as defined in  the Risk Appetite Statement. The ALM policy is supplemented by other  liquidity policies relating to intraday liquidity, stress testing, contingency  funding plan and liquidity policies for each of the overseas branches. The liquidity profile of the Bank is monitored for both domestic as well  as overseas operations on a static as well as on a dynamic basis by using  the gap analysis technique supplemented by monitoring of key liquidity  ratios and conduct of liquidity stress tests periodically. Periodical  liquidity positions and liquidity stress results are reviewed by the Bank’s  ALCO and the Risk Management Committee of the Board. The Bank has integrated liquidity risk management guidelines issued  by RBI pursuant to the Basel III framework on liquidity standards in  its asset liability management framework. These include the intraday  liquidity management and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The Bank  maintains LCR/NSFR in accordance with the RBI guidelines and the  defined risk appetite of the Bank.  Operational  risk Operational risks may emanate from  inadequate and/or missing controls in  internal processes, people and systems or  from external events or a combination of all  the four. Operational risk manifests in the form of - •   Core process risk •   Change management risk •   Outsourcing risk •   Continuity risk •   Information & cyber security risk Core operational risk The Bank has in place an Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy  to manage the operational risk in an effective, efficient and proactive  manner. The policy aims at assessing and measuring the magnitude of  risks, monitoring and mitigating them through a well-defined framework  and governance structure. The Bank has set up a comprehensive Operational Risk Measurement  System for documenting, assessing, and periodic monitoring of various  risks and controls linked to various processes across all business lines. Change management risk All new products and processes, as well as changes in existing products  and processes are subjected to risk evaluation by the Operational Risk  team. The overall responsibility of new products is vested with the Risk  Department through the Bank’s Product Management Committee and  Change Management Committee. Outsourcing risk Outsourcing arrangements are examined and approved by the Bank’s  Outsourcing Committee after due recommendations from the  Operational Risk team. 

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 266 Risk type Definition Approach to risk management Business continuity risk The Business Continuity Planning Management Committee (BCPMC)  exercises oversight on the implementation of the approved Business  Continuity Plan (BCP) framework which has been put in place to ensure  continuity of service to its large customer base. The effectiveness of  the approved Business Continuity Plan (BCP) framework is tested for  all identified critical internal activities to ensure readiness to meet  various contingency scenarios. The learning from the BCP exercises are  used as inputs to further refine the framework. With effective Business  Continuity Plan in place, the Bank has effectively managed to run its  operations by adapting to various continuity/mitigation plans. Information security risk The Bank pursues a holistic Information and cyber security program with  a comprehensive Information Security policy, Cyber Security policy and  standards based on industry best practices with compliance to regulatory  guidelines. These policies are aligned with the regulatory directives on  Information and Cyber security and with global best practices like NIST,  ISO27001:2013, PCI DSS etc. The governance framework is in place at executive level with Information  System Security Committee constituting key business functions meeting  at least once in a quarter to assess the threat landscape and validate the  controls enforced in the Bank commensurate with the cyber risks. The Bank has invested in strong technical and administrative controls  to proactively prevent, detect and contain and respond any suspicious  activity. The Bank is compliant to ISO27001 standard and PCI DSS  standard. The Bank conducts various assessments to identify and  remediate risks before any application and/or IT infrastructure  component is deployed. These assessments include Application security,  vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, security architecture  review data security assessment etc. The Bank also has adopted  defense in depth methodology to protect its valuable assets from  intrusion by malicious actors. The Bank has 24 x 7 Security Operation  Center (SOC) to keep vigil on its digital assets and coordinates with  RBI, Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN), National  Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC), National  Payments Corporation Of India (NPCI) etc. for implementation of their  recommendation to strengthen its defense against cyber-attacks. The Information System Security Committee of the Bank provides  directions for mitigating operational risk in the information systems.  Over the year, the Bank has focused on strengthening the operational  and information security risk frameworks by implementing several  initiatives. 

Management’s discussion and analysis 267 Strategic initiatives undertaken in fiscal 2025 The Bank has invested in strengthening the risk infrastructure across multiple dimensions. During fiscal 2025, the Risk Department enhanced its coverage of risks by strengthening the governance around group  risk through a comprehensive group risk appetite and deeper coverage of key risks by the EGRMC. The Department also  continued to enhance its scope of model risk by enhancing the model governance and validation processes. In terms of control environment, the Department strengthened controls around operational risk, technology resilience and  digital banking, leading to a reduction in the level of critical and persistent operational risks. Finally, Risk Department led the operational risk and compliance culture initiatives and tracked the milestones therein to  closure, which would, over time, lead to a robust risk lens being embedded in business. Risk Department also continued to work on its four areas of distinctiveness - •   Enhancing the climate and ESG risk conversations in the Bank •   Training and certification for cyber security •   Models in the retail lending space for credit – led underwriting •   Models and toolkits for rural lending The Risk team remains focused on supporting the Bank in implementing its GPS strategy in a risk – sensitive manner. To  that end, the team has identified a few critical initiatives to support the various strategic thrusts such as enhancing toolkits  around digital banking, rural lending, cyber security, universal underwriting and enhanced credit monitoring. Further, to  strengthen the risk culture, Risk Department will focus on stronger risk appetite governance, proactive risk actioning around  key risk concerns and enhanced group risk oversight. Successful implementation of these initiatives will help the Bank to achieve its GPS objectives in a sustainable manner,  embedded in the bedrock of a robust assurance culture. Subsidiary Governance As a Financial Conglomerate (FC), Axis Group has established a robust framework & process of governance over its subsidiaries,  approved by the parent Bank’s Risk Management Committee and Board, and Subsidiary Governance Department (SGD),  which plays key role in ensuring: a.   alignment of important policies by the subsidiaries with group wide policies & best practices; and b.   regular engagement with the subsidiaries and the concerned departments in the Bank involved in the process of  governance over subsidiaries to review status of governance and further reporting to group level executive committees  and the committees of the  B oard of the Bank. Over the last year, the Bank has tightened the process of governance over subsidiaries and some of the important measures  taken include review of penalties levied by regulators on the subsidiaries to reduce, if not eliminate, them in a sustainable  manner, by guiding them to make changes in systems & processes. Further, framework for reporting of significant events has  been put in place, which lists down the incidents/events which the subsidiaries are required to report to the Bank along with  timeline, details to be shared and the recipient departments & process to be followed thereafter by respective departments  responsible for reporting to executive & Board committees. All the matters of subsidiary governance are overseen by the executive committees, namely Subsidiary Governance  Committee (SGC) & Enterprise   Risk Management Committee (EGRMC)   and Board of the Bank as well as committees of the  Board, namely ACB, RMC and CSCB. These forums are provided update on important matters relating governance in the  group companies by group assurance heads and SGD on a quarterly basis. 

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 268 Compliance Compliance function is one of the key elements in the Banks’ corporate governance structure. The Bank follows Board  approved policies to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements, which are updated regularly to factor in the  changing and increasing regulatory and supervisory requirements and expectations, as well as other good practices.  Identification, assessment, and management of compliance risks and ensuring timely and comprehensive compliance to  regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis is an integral part of basic responsibilities of every employee, stakeholder, and  function within the Bank. The Board and senior management emphasise zero tolerance for non-compliance to regulatory  requirements. The Bank’s Compliance department ensures that overall business of the Bank is conducted in strict adherence to the  guidelines/statutory provisions as stipulated by the regulators/authorities and guides the business units and other  stakeholders on regulatory requirements with a special emphasis on better understanding of the perspective/spirit of the  guidelines and regulations. It closely works with Risk and Internal Audit functions and monitors various activities of the  Bank with emphasis on proactive regulatory risk management. The Bank has been undertaking various projects/measures to strengthen the compliance monitoring, as part of continuous  improvement, through review of frameworks, processes, enhancement of technology, use of AI tools, etc. The other  important focus areas to ensure robust regulatory compliance continues to be the frameworks for Root Cause Analysis (RCA),  accountability & consequence management, self-identification of issues & remediation by first line of defence, compliance  testing frameworks and automation of processes wherever feasible to eliminate the operational errors. The Bank has also strengthened its oversight over its subsidiaries through implementation of group governance framework/ policy, review of compliance with the business licenses issued by regulators/authorities to subsidiaries and alignment of  policies of subsidiaries with Bank’s policies wherever required. All heads of compliance functions in the subsidiaries have a  dotted line reporting to the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who oversees the status of regulatory compliance across the  group through laid down process of timely and regular reporting by the subsidiaries and an ongoing monitoring process. Internal Audit The Internal Audit function of the Bank operates independently under the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board,  which reviews & evaluates the efficacy and performance of the internal audit function. The audit policy, strategy and plan  for carrying out audits across functions of the Bank and the Axis Group are approved by the Audit Committee of the Board.  Further, audit policy, strategy and plan are reviewed regularly to factor in inputs received from regulatory guidance, changes  in regulations, business landscape & emerging areas of business and risks, learnings from various operational failures, risk  incidents, frauds, etc., in a dynamic manner. The Internal Audit function provides an independent assurance to the Board of Directors and Senior Management on the  quality and efficacy of the internal controls, risk management systems, governance systems and processes in place on an  on-going basis. This is provided to primarily ensure that business and non-business functions are following both internal and  regulatory guidelines and processes. In line with the RBI’s guidelines on Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA), the Bank has adopted a risk based internal audit policy.  The Risk Based Internal Audit policy has been designed factoring regulatory guidelines and international best practices.  The policy has a well-defined architecture for conducting Risk Based Internal Audit which articulates the audit strategy  in terms of a concerted focus on strategic and emerging business risks. These inputs form a key step in the identification  of the audit universe for the audit planning exercise. The audit frequencies are in congruence with the risk profile of each  unit which is audited. Further, concurrent audit, off-site audit, and thematic & snap audit reviews have been integrated into  the internal audit process to make the function more robust. The Audit function recommends for making improvements in  operational processes, design elements and policies, as part of audit report recommendations. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotic process automation are deployed to harness enhanced  efficiency and effectiveness in performance of audits. Automated checks and tests have been developed across various  functions covering retail, wholesale, treasury, operations, and also to augment thematic audits, information security audit,  revenue audit and concurrent audit, to independently evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls on  an ongoing basis and to proactively recommend enhancements to the process owners. The Internal Audit function has  mix of resources with expertise in technology and functional skill for effectively conducting various types of audits. The  

Management’s discussion and analysis 269 Internal Audit function continuously strives to enhance its effectiveness & efficiency through internal reviews and external  evaluations and augmenting skill sets of the audit resources for making Internal Audit Function agile and responsive towards  the emerging and strategic risks. Internal Audit framework for subsidiaries has been further strengthened under the Group governance framework by having  group audit policy, which is supplemented by structured engagement, audit oversight, monitoring of key KRIs and conducting  thematic audits. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) & Sustainability CSR The Bank’s ‘OPEN’ philosophy continues to shape its strategy and actions towards creating long term impact in the  community. Through its CSR interventions, which are guided by the CSR Policy and overseen by the Board and its CSR  Committee, the Bank has been contributing towards the socio-economic welfare of underprivileged and under-represented  communities across the country primarily under the broad themes of sustainable livelihoods, education, financial literacy  and inclusion, conservation and protection of the environment, health & nutrition, sports, as well as humanitarian and  relief based interventions. The Bank’s CSR efforts consciously strive to touch the most marginalized communities such as  those in the aspirational districts, remote regions and north-east regions. The Bank continues to ensure that its CSR Policy,  governance and oversight, and project implementation are in accordance with the Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013  and all rules made thereunder. The Bank’s CSR interventions continue to be delivered directly, through credible implementation partners, and the CSR arm  of the Bank viz. Axis Bank Foundation. Axis Bank Foundation was established in 2006 as a Trust to give strategic direction to the Bank’s CSR aspirations. Since  2012, the foundation’s activities are focused on the theme of Sustainable Livelihoods, delivered across the two pillars of  Rural Livelihoods and Skill Development. Since 2018, the Foundation has implemented its ambitious ‘Mission 2 Million’  commitment of supporting 2 million households in India. In fiscal 2025, ABF achieved this milestone impacting 2.05 million  participants across 300 districts in 32 states and union territories as on 31 March, 2025. In this fiscal alone, it reached 0.39  million participants. This year, the Bank expanded its efforts in Education theme – scaling Axis DilSe® interventions to new remote geographies,  strengthening education system through key partnerships, and supporting advance research and innovation. The Bank expanded its Axis DilSe® interventions to Arunachal Pradesh, launching a school transformation program in Shi  Yomi district and establishing a Teacher Training & Skill Academy at Mechuka. This initiative in partnership with Sunbird  Trust, is expected to benefit more than 2,500 children and 900 teachers over the program period, strengthening the  education ecosystem in the region. Additionally, the Bank scaled up its Block Transformation Program in partnership with  Tata Steel Foundation to six more blocks – three in Odisha and three in Jharkhand – building on the success of Odapada  block transformation program. This expansion ensures equitable and quality education for more communities. As part of strengthening the education system, the Bank partnered with Sri Aurobindo Society to build the teacher capacity  of over 300 Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Schools and over 80 state government schools across 6 states, in competency- based learnings, assessments, and pedagogies, in alignment with NEP 2020. Additionally, the Bank collaborated with Mantra  Social Services to improve educational outcomes by catalyzing collective action in five districts across Chhattisgarh, Odisha  and Jharkhand, driving systemic improvements in the education sector. To support research and innovation, the Bank scaled up its partnership with Plaksha University to construct and  operationalize Future Tech building which will house experiential learning spaces, innovation facilities, and collaborative  hubs. Additionally, the  B ank will institute a Faculty Chair at the university and support Ph.D. and Post doctoral fellowships  to strengthen academic excellence and research impact. As part of the Bank’s efforts in the Healthcare sector, it announced strategic partnerships with three leading cancer care  and research institutions—National Cancer Grid (NCG) under Tata Memorial Centre, The Indian Cancer Society (ICS), and St  Jude India Childcare Centers. The partnership will enhance digital oncology infrastructure, improve access to cancer care,  and support research and early diagnosis initiatives. 

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 270 This year, the Bank also introduced sports as a new thematic focus area. The Bank partnered with Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ)  to support 224 athletes and para-athletes across 10 Olympic and 8 paralympic disciplines. Additionally, in collaboration with  Inspire Institute of Sport (IIS), the Bank launched a Judo Development Program in Manipur to nurture grassroots talent in the  Judo discipline. Under this initiative, 104 young judokas received foundational training in Manipur, while 53 female judokas  will be awarded full scholarships to study and train at the state-of-the-art IIS campus in Vijayanagar, Karnataka. Under the Environment theme, the Bank made considerable progress towards meeting its commitment planting 2 million  trees across India by 2027 and continued to support plantation programs over and above its commitment. As of 31 March,  2025, ~3.27 million saplings had been planted across 7 geographies by the Bank’s implementing partners thereby achieving  its target. The interventions also supporting vulnerable communities living in the peripheries of protected forests and  reducing human-animal conflict. During the year, the Bank extended humanitarian support and relief in flood affected areas in Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra  and Manipur working with its partners or local organizations. Additional details on the Bank’s CSR governance, interventions  and impact for the reporting year can be accessed in the Annual Report on CSR Activities which forms part of this Annual  Report. Additional information is also available on the Bank’s corporate website at  https://www.axisbank.com/csr   and on the  Foundation’s website at  http://www.axisbankfoundation.org/ ESG Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) is integral to the Bank’s long-term organizational strategy and actions. The Bank  continues to align its overall decision-making and subsequent operations to its Purpose Statement - ‘Banking that leads to a  more inclusive and equitable economy, thriving community and a healthier planet’. To drive action on focused themes under the larger ESG agenda, specific groups have been set up at the management level.  These include the ESG Working Group to drive sustainable financing initiatives and the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)  Council to drive the diversity focus. In fiscal 2022, Axis Bank had become the first Indian bank to establish a standalone  Board level ESG Committee, enabling the Bank to align its diverse priorities and activities under a unified and cohesive  ESG agenda. Under the ESG Committee’s oversight, the Bank had also announced a series of ESG-aligned commitments  with its business and non-business activities, which are being driven by the pertinent verticals across the organization. The  Bank’s commitments are aligned to pertinent Sustainable Development Goals and to India’s climate commitments under  the Paris Agreement. In fiscal 2025, the ESG Committee of the Board met 4 times, wherein it reviewed the Bank’s progress  towards achieving its ESG-aligned commitments and also provided its guidance on new initiatives and activities. The Bank’s  overall ESG-aligned activities, highlights and developments during the fiscal, including its progress on its commitments, are  published in this Integrated Annual Report which is aligned to the <IIRC> framework and the GRI reporting framework. Towards its commitment of achieving incremental wholesale lending of  ` 30,000 crores in sectors with positive sustainable  impact by 2026, as included in the Bank’s Sustainable Financing Framework, the Bank achieved  ` 30,409 crores of incremental  lending as of 31 March, 2024 thereby meeting its target much in advance. Therefore, in this fiscal, the Bank re-evaluated the  wholesale lending target and set it to  ` 60,000 crores to sectors with positive social and environmental outcomes by 2030.  The Bank has achieved  ` 48,412 crores of incremental lending as of 31 March, 2025. In fiscal 2022, the Bank had also taken  an internal commitment to scaling down its exposure to coal mining and trading, and thermal power sectors, which is being  tracked on a quarterly basis and reported to the ESG Committee of the Board. As of 31 March, 2025, the Bank’s exposure to  these two sectors was well within the annual limits set as part of the glide path. The Bank’s total Wholesale lending portfolio  in the ‘green’ sectors stood at  ` 22,160 crores as of 31 March, 2025. Towards its commitment to making 5% of its Retail Two-Wheeler loan portfolio as electric by March 2024, the Bank achieved  an EV share of 3.62% till fiscal 2024 (cumulatively since 1 October, 2021), partly due to policy changes such as changes to  FAME II program and consumer anxiety around charging infrastructure and lack of used market. Notably, in this period, the  Bank entered into exclusive dealer finance programs, launched a differential policy to support the EV segment, and scaled its  retail tie ups, in addition to offering a sector-leading up to 0.5% interest discount on EV loans, thus achieving an EV share of  5.53% for this fiscal. During the year, the Bank also re-evaluated its EV lending portfolio and set up new targets to increase  the share of electric vehicle revenue in two-wheeler loan portfolio and four-wheeler passenger loan portfolio to 6% and 4%  respectively by 2027. As of 31 March, 2025, the Bank has achieved an incremental lending of 7.14% in Two-Wheeler electric  vehicle and 2.92% in Four-Wheeler passenger segment electric vehicle. The Bank is also actively scaling its ESG aligned retail  products including solar rooftop loans for SMEs and green home loans. 

Management’s discussion and analysis 271 Under the ESG Committee’s oversight, the Bank has been actively working towards strengthening its climate risk management  capabilities at the enterprise level. In 2022, the Bank had reached its first milestone of embedding ESG- and climate-related  risks and opportunities into its annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In 2023, the Bank had also  significantly strengthened its ESG Policy for Lending that integrates environmental and social risk assessment into its credit  appraisal for Wholesale Banking. The updated Policy now mandatorily requires scrutiny of proposals in sectors identified  as hazardous, such as coal mining, thermal power and hazardous chemicals. Notably, key proposals discussed at the Board’s  Committee of Directors now include an assessment under the ESG Policy for Lending. In 2023, the Bank had launched a pilot ESG Rating Model for select clients in the Wholesale Banking business vertical. The  Model, developed in-house, includes more than 80 parameters across the three pillars of E, S and G and went live in March  2024 for select sectors. Notably, the Bank has also published its first ESG Risk dashboard, that has also been presented to  the Board’s Risk Management Committee. As part of the said dashboard, the Bank has also developed a hazard heat map for  identified sectors, including its Retail Mortgages, Rural, and MSME lending verticals. Additionally, the dashboard also includes  an assessment of the transition risk in sectors identified as having “high” transition risk, including iron and steel, cement,  and fertilizers and agrochemicals. During the year, the Bank’s Risk and Wholesale Underwriting verticals participated in a    two-day Climate Risk training by Indian and international experts as part of a UK Government program. The Bank continues its focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Towards its commitment to achieve 30% representation  of women in its workforce by fiscal 2027, the Bank has been actively scaling up hiring diversity across all business and  support verticals while launching innovative initiatives that truly embody the Bank’s organizational ethos. In line with the  same, in fiscal 2021, the Bank introduced “Pause for Bias” as an integral component of the induction module for new joiners.  This module encourages employees to recognize and address their inherent biases. This further lays the foundation for the  Bank’s “Gateway to Inclusion” program with its focus on ensuring everyday inclusion. By reaching out to over 16,000 people  managers, the Bank ensures that every team is enriched by diverse perspectives and that diverse representation is integral  to every decision-making process. The Bank established the “Women in Sales” employee resource group with a focused  mission to build an ecosystem that promotes capacity building, mentoring, and holistic support.  T his group is driven by a  core committee of 30 senior leaders and a working committee of 100 employees from across various business units and with  representation of men and women from Axis group—all dedicated to elevating women’s success in sales. Breaking heuristic  patterns in hiring, the #HouseWorkIsWork campaign continues to champion homegrown skills as the cornerstone of its  hiring strategy. Drawing interest from over 4,000 candidates, this initiative affirms that a career break should not mean a  permanent pause rather a fresh start enriched with new, valuable life-taught skills. The Bank continues its effort in creating  an inclusive ecosystem for employees and customers from the LGBTQIA+ community through the #ComeAsYouAre Charter,  This Charter highlights progressive policies— health coverage of partners regardless of marital status or gender, to offering  inclusive leave benefits for birthing parents and their partners, along with a dress code that honours each individual’s self- affirmed gender identity. The Bank formalized the Pride365 employee resource group that has grown from strength to  strength from 7 employees during its inception year to over 1,000 employees with representation from diverse identities  in the queer spectrum. Beyond internal programs, the Bank is also furthering its external impact on DEI. The Bank actively  engages with communities and with people in the corporate ecosystem to promote best practices in diversity and inclusion,  thereby catalysing positive change across society at large. The Bank’s grass rooted effort Axis Women in Motion reached  over 25,000 people from across towns, hinterlands and talukas—this program is focussed on encouraging women to build  themselves as independent economic entities. Focusing on the student ecosystem, with a vision of cultivating the next  generation of inclusive leaders, the Axis DE&I Curriculum on Building and Leading Inclusive Organizations was administered  in 20 academic institutes, awarding certificates to over 800 students. These comprehensive sessions equip emerging leaders  with the insights necessary to create and sustain inclusive environments, setting the stage for a transformative future in  workplaces everywhere. This fiscal year the Bank’s initiative “Axis ViBE”, (varsity of inclusive business enterprises) continued its focus on championing  robust DEI practices across the broader business community and nurturing a collaborative ecosystem that values equity and  inclusion. Through a series of dynamic events, this initiative reached 165 organisations. With these initiatives, the Bank remains steadfast in its belief that every voice matters and that authentic inclusion drives  innovation, excellence, and lasting success. During the year, the Bank significantly scaled up its participation in and contribution to thought leadership and advocacy  around the topics of ESG, climate change, financial inclusion, diversity, and sustainable finance, among others. The Bank’s  

Statutory reports Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 272 senior leaders are members of key committees on these topics at FICCI, CII, IBA, MCA, among others, as well as at the  market regulators including SEBI.

Standalone financial statements 325 Independent Auditor’s Report To The Members of Axis Bank Limited Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Opinion 1.   We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of Axis Bank Limited (‘the Bank’), which comprise  the Standalone Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2025, the Standalone Profit And Loss Account, and the Standalone Cash  Flow Statement for the year ended on that date, and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements, including a summary  of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (‘the Standalone Financial Statements’). 2.   In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone  Financial Statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as well as the Companies Act,  2013 (‘the Act’) and circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (‘the RBI’), in the manner so required for  banking companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Accounting Standards prescribed under section  133 of the Act, read with the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 (‘AS’) and other accounting principles  generally accepted in India, of the State of Affairs of the Bank as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and its Cash Flows for  the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion 3.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (‘SAs’) specified under section 143(10) of the  Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank, in accordance with the Code of  Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are  relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder,  and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key Audit Matters 4.   Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate  opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the Key Audit Matters: Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit 1 Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting As the Bank operates on Core Banking Solution across its branches  and asset centres, the reliability and security of Information  Technology (“IT”) systems plays a key role in the business  operations. Since large volume of transactions are processed daily,  the IT controls are required to ensure that applications process  data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate  manner. IT infrastructure is critical for smooth functioning and accurate  accounting and financial reporting process. Due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the IT environment,  we have ascertained key IT systems used in financial reporting  process and its related controls as a key audit matter. In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we  involved our specialists to understand the IT control environment,  IT infrastructure and IT systems. We conducted an assessment and identified key IT systems that  are critical for accounting and financial reporting process and  are relevant for our audit and tested their internal controls. In  particular: •      We obtained an understanding of the Bank’s IT control  environment and key changes during the audit period that  may be relevant to the audit; 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 326 Standalone Financial Statement Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit 1 Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting •     We tested the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of the Bank’s General IT controls over the  key IT systems that are critical to accounting and financial  reporting. This included evaluation of Bank’s controls for user  access management, program change management, database  management, network operations, incident management and  other IT operations performed by the Bank during the period  of audit; •      We tested key automated and manual business cycle controls  and logic for system generated reports relevant to the audit;  and •      We also tested compensating controls and performed  alternate procedures to assess whether there were any  unaddressed IT risks that would materially impact the  financial statements. 2 Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning on Advances (IRAC) as per the regulatory requirements. Total Loans and Advances (Net of Provision) as at 31 March 2025: INR 1,040,811 crore Provision for Non-Performing Advances as at 31 March 2025: INR 10,272.49 crore Refer Schedule 9, Schedule 17(5.3) and Schedule 18(1)- Note 1.4 The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular issued by  the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) on ‘Prudential Norms for Income  Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining  to Advances’ (the’ IRAC norms’) and amendments thereto (“RBI  guidelines”) which prescribes the norms for identification and  classification of Non-Performing Assets (‘NPAs’) and the minimum  provision required for such assets. The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the  identification and provision required against NPAs considering  various quantitative as well as qualitative factors. As the identification of and provisioning against NPAs requires  considerable level of management estimation, application of  various regulatory requirements and its significance to the overall  audit due to stakeholder and regulatory focus, we have identified  this as a key audit matter. •      Our audit approach included testing the design, operating  effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit  procedures in respect of income recognition, asset  classification and provisioning pertaining to advances. In  particular: •      We have evaluated and understood the Bank’s internal  control system in adhering to the RBI guidelines; •      We have analysed and understood key IT systems/  applications used and tested the design and implementation  and operational effectiveness of relevant controls in relation  to income recognition, asset classification, viz., standard, sub- standard, doubtful and loss with reference to RBI guidelines  and provisioning pertaining to advances; and •      We test checked advances to examine the validity and  accuracy of the recorded amounts, provision for NPAs, and  compliance with IRAC norms. •      Assessed appropriateness & the adequacy of disclosures as  per RBI guidelines relating to NPAs. Other Information 5.   The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the  information included in the Bank’s Annual Report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our  auditor’s report thereon. The Other Information included is expected to be made available to us after the date of this  auditor’s report. 6.   Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any  form of assurance conclusion thereon. 7.   In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to  be materially misstated. 

Standalone financial statements 327 8.   When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required  to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the  relevant laws and regulations. R esponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements 9.   The Bank’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act, with  respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the State of Affairs,  Profit and Cash Flows of the Bank in accordance with the Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the  Act read with the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, and other accounting principles generally accepted  in India and provisions of section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars and guidelines and issued by  the RBI from time to time (‘RBI Guidelines’). This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank  and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection of the appropriate accounting software for  ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those related to retention of audit logs; selection  and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for  ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the  Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error. 10.   In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for  assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern  and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Management and the Board of Directors either intends to  liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 11.   The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 12.   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. 13.   As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also:   13.1.    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to  fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.   13.2.    Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial  Statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls.   13.3.     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by the Management.   13.4.    Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on  the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty  exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone  Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may  cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern. 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 328   13.5.    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events  in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 14.   We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing  of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. 15.   We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.   From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the current year and are therefore the key audit  matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about  the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our  report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication. Other Matters 16.   Attention is drawn to the fact that the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 March 2024  were audited by predecessor auditors whose report dated 24 April 2024 expressed an unmodified opinion on those  Standalone Financial Statements. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 17.   The Standalone Balance Sheet and the Standalone Profit and Loss account have been drawn up in accordance with  the provisions of section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and section 133 of the Act and relevant rules  issued thereunder. 18.   As required by sub-section (3) of section 30 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, based on our audit we report that:   18.1.    We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief,  were necessary for the purpose of our audit and have found them to be satisfactory;   18.2.    The transactions of the Bank, which have come to our notice during the course of our audit, have been within the  powers of the Bank; and   18.3.    Since the key operations of the Bank are automated with the key applications integrated to the core banking  system, the audit is carried out centrally, as all the necessary records and data required for the purposes of our  audit are available therein. We have visited 92 branches (including credit units) to examine the records maintained  at such branches for the purpose of our audit. 19.   Further, as required by Section 143(3) of the Act based on our audit we report, to the extent applicable, that:   19.1.

Opinion 1.   We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements of Axis Bank  Limited (‘the Bank’) as at 31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the  Bank for the year ended on that date. 2.   In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to the  Standalone Financial Statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025,  based on the internal controls over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial  Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the Guidance Note’). Management’s responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 3.   The Bank’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal  controls over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of  its business, including adherence to the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection  of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable  financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s responsibility 4.   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone  Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the  Standards on Auditing (‘SA’), prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal  financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements. Those SAs and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with the ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements were established  and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 5.   Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The  procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. 6.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements 7.   A bank’s internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial  Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A bank’s internal  financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements include those policies and procedures that Annexure ‘A’ to the Independent Auditors’ report on the Standalone Financial  Statements of Axis Bank Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025 

Standalone financial statements 331   (1)    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the Bank;   (2)    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone  Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations of Management and Directors  of the Bank; and   (3)    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or  disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements 8.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements,  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to  error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with  reference to the Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in  conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Standalone financial statements 343 17.   Significant accounting policies to the Standalone Financial Statements     For the year ended 31 March, 2025 1.   Background   Axis Bank Limited (‘the Bank’) was incorporated in 1993 and provides a complete suite of banking and financial services  including retail banking, wholesale banking and treasury operations. The Bank is primarily governed by the Banking  Regulation Act, 1949. As on 31 March 2025, the Bank has overseas branches at Singapore, DIFC - Dubai and an Offshore  Banking Unit at the International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City),  Gand hinagar, India. 2.   Basis of preparation   The  S tandalone  F inancial  S tatements (‘financial statements’) have been prepared and presented under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in  India, unless otherwise stated by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’), to comply with the statutory requirements prescribed  under the Third Schedule of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the circulars, notifications, guidelines and directives  issued by the RBI from time to time and the Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act,  2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021  to the extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. Accounting policies applied  have been consistent with the previous year except ot herwise stated. 3.   Use of estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles requires  the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including  contingent liabilities) at the date of the financial statements, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual  results could differ from those estimates. The Management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the  preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Any revisions, as and when carried out, to the  accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the current and  future periods. 4.   Changes in accounting policies   Effective 1 April, 2024, the Bank has carried out the following changes in its accou nting policies: 4.1   Classification and Valuation  of Investments   Effective 1 April, 2024 the Bank has adopted the revised framework as detailed in RBI Master Direction on Classification,  Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio issued on 12 September, 2023 (‘RBI Investment Direction, 2023’).  Accordingly, as prescribed under the transition provisions of the aforesaid framework the Bank has (1) transferred the  balance in Investment Reserve Account as at 31 March, 2024 of ₹242.29 crores to the general reserve (2) transferred  an amount of ₹1,217.86 crores (net of tax) to the general reserve, resulting into increase in the net worth of the Bank,  on account of reversal of balance in provision for depreciation on investments as at 31 March, 2024 and adjustment for  the difference between the carrying value of its investment portfolio as per the revised framework and the previous  carrying value as at  31 March, 2024.   Further, in compliance with the said RBI Investment Direction 2023, the valuation gains and losses at the period ended  31 March, 2025, across all performing investments held under Available for Sale (AFS) category are aggregated and the  net appreciation amounting to ₹110.39 crores (net of tax) has been directly recognised in AFS Reserve. The securities  held in Fair Value through Profit and Loss (‘FVTPL’) category are fair valued at the period ended 31 March, 2025 and  the net gain of ₹700.51 crores for the year ended 31 March, 2025, arising on such valuation has been recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account. Figures for the previous year are not comparable  to that extent. 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 344 5.   Significant accounting policies 5.1   Investments   Significant accounting policies for investments appl icable for FY25   Classification   In accordance with the RBI Investment Direction, 2023, investments (except investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures  and associates) are classified at the time of  acquisition as:   •   Held to Ma turity (‘HTM’);   •   Available for S ale (‘AFS’) and   •   Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) with Held for Trading (HFT) as a separate investment  subcategor y within FVTPL.   Classification of Investments in th e Balance sheet   For disclosure in the Balance Sheet, investments in India are classified under six categories - Government Securities,  Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investment in Subsidiaries/Joint Ventures/Associates and  Others. Investments made outside India are classified under three categories - Government Securities, Subsidiaries  and/or Joint Ventures abr oad and Others.   All investments are accounted for on settlement date, except investments in equity shares which are accounted  for  on trade date.   i.   Held to M aturity (‘HTM’)     The Bank classifies investments as HTM, if both of the following cond itions are met:     •   The investment is acquired with the intention and objective of holding it to maturity, i.e., the financial assets  are held with an objective to collect the contractual  cash flows; and    •   The contractual terms of the investment give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest on principal outstanding (‘SPPI criterion’) on s pecified dates.   ii.   Available f or Sale (‘AFS’)     The Bank classifies investments as AFS, if both the following cond itions are met:     •   The investment is acquired with an objective which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and  selling  securities; and     •   The contractual terms of the investment give rise to cash flows that meet SPPI criterion on s pecified dates.     The Bank, upon initial recognition, may make an irrevocable election to classify an equity instrument as an AFS  that is not held with the object ive of trading.   iii.   Fair Value through Profit a nd Loss (FVTPL)     The investments that are not classified as HTM or AFS are classified as FVTPL. The Bank classifies investments in  FVTPL category as either FVTPL-Held for Trading (‘HFT’) or FVTPL Non-HFT. Any investment held by the Bank  for one or more of the following purposes is, when it is first recognised on its books, designated  as a FVTPL HFT:    •   sho rt-term resale;     •   profiting from short-term p rice movements;     •   locking in arbitr age profits; or     •   hedging risks that arise from instruments meeting a ll of the above     Investments in listed equities, trading-related repo-style transactions, instruments resulting from market-making  activities, equity investments in a fund are included in FVTPL HFT category. Investments in unlisted equities are  included in FVTPL No n-HFT category. 

Standalone financial statements 345     All other investments forming part of FVTPL category are classified as  FVTPL Non-HFT.     Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and  Joint Ventures     All investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures held by Bank are classified under this category  separately from the aforesaid investm ent categories.    Init ial recognition     The Bank measures all investments at fair value on initial recognition. Unless facts and circumstances suggest  that the fair value is materially different from the acquisition cost, it is presumed that the acquisition cost is  the fair value.    i.   A cquisition cost       Costs incurred at the time of acquisition, pertaining to investments, such as brokerage, commission etc. are  charged to the Profit and Loss Account. Broken period interest is charged to the Profit and Loss Account.  Cost of investments is computed based on the weighted avera ge cost method.    ii.   Day 1 gain/loss       Day 1 Gain/loss is the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and acquisition cost. Any Day 1  gain/loss arising on quoted investments is recognized in the Profit and Loss Account. Any Day 1 loss arising  from Level 3 investments is recognised immediately. Any Day 1 gains arising from Level 3 investments is  deferred. In the case of debt instruments, the Day 1 gain is amortized on a straight-line basis up to the  maturity date (or earliest call date for perpetual instruments), while for unquoted equity instruments, the gain  is set aside as a liability until the security is listed o r derecognised.    iii.   Subsequ ent measurement     a.   Investments classified under t he HTM category       Investments held in HTM category are carried at cost and are not Mark-to-Market (MTM) after initial  recognition. Any discount or premium on the investments under HTM category is amortised over the  remaining life of the instrument. The amortised amount is reflected under item II ‘Income on Investments’ of  Schedule 13: ‘Interest Earned’ with a contra in Schedule 8:  ‘Investments’.

The amortised amount is reflected in the financial  statements under item II ‘Income on Investments’ of Schedule 13: ‘In terest Earned’.   Valuation   The Bank determines the fair values of its investments according to the follo wing hierarchy:   Level 1: Valuation based on quoted market price: These investments are valued with quoted prices (unadjusted) for  identical instruments in active markets that the Bank can access at the me asurement date.   Level 2: Valuation based on using observable inputs: These investments are valued with inputs other than quoted prices  included within Level 1, that are observable, either directly  or indirectly.   Level 3: Valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: These investments are valued using valuation  techniques where one or more significant inputs ar e unobservable.   The fair value of various types of instruments is determined as per the valuation norms laid down in RBI Investment  Direction 20 23, as follows:   •   The fair value of quoted investments (other than discounted instruments) included in the AFS and FVTPL  categories is considered as available from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges or prices, yield and spread  matrix declared by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (‘FIMMDA’)/Financial  Benchmark India Private Limited (‘FBIL’) , periodically.   •   Treasury Bills, Exchange Funded Bills, Commercial Paper and Certificate of Deposits being discounted instruments,  are valued at carrying cost which includes discount accreted over the peri od to maturity.   •   Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest repurchase price/Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) declared by t he mutual fund.   •   Units of Venture Capital Funds (‘VCF’) and Unquoted Alternative Investment Fund (AIFs) are valued at Net Asset  Value (NAV) declared by the funds. Where an AIF fails to carry out and disclose the valuation of its investments by  an independent valuer as per the frequency mandated by SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund) Regulations, 2012,  the value of its units is treated as Re. 1. In case AIF is not registered under SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund)  Regulations, 2012 and the latest disclosed valuation of its investments by an independent valuer precedes the date  of valuation by more than 18 months, the value of its units is tr eated as Re. 1.   •   Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures category are assessed for impairment to determine  permanent diminution, if any, in accordance with the RBI guidelines and suitable provi sions are made.   •   The fair value of investments where current quotations are not available, is determined in accordance with the  norms prescribed by the RBI/FIMMDA /FBIL as under:    a)   The fair value of unquoted government securities which are in the nature of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (‘SLR’)  securities forming part of AFS, FVTPL-HFT and FVTPL Non-HFT categories are computed as per the rates  published  by FIMMDA/FBIL.     b)   In case of special bonds issued by the Government of India that do not qualify for SLR purposes, unquoted  bonds, debentures and preference shares where interest/dividend is received regularly (i.e. not overdue  

Standalone financial statements 347 beyond 90 days), the market price is derived based on the Yield to maturity (‘YTM’) for such securities as  published by FIMMDA/FBIL and suitably marked up for credit risk applicable to the credit rating of the  instrument. The matrix for credit risk mark-up for each category and credit ratings along with residual maturity  issued by FIMMDA/FBIL is adopted fo r this purpose.     c)   In case of bonds & debentures where interest is not received regularly (i.e. overdue beyond 90 days), the  valuation is in accordance with prudential norms for provisioning as prescri bed by the RBI.     d)   Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) are valued as per extant RBI/FIM MDA guidelines.     e)   Equity shares, for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not quoted on the  stock exchanges, are valued at break-up value (without considering revaluation reserves, if any) which is  ascertained from the company’s latest Balance Sheet (not older than 18 months). In case the latest Balance  Sheet is not available, the shares are valued at Re.  1 per company.     f)   Valuation of investments in private equity funds and limited liability partnership funds is based on valuation  of their underl ying exposures.     g)   Investments in listed instruments of Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’)/Infrastructure Investment Trust  (‘INVIT’) are valued at the closing price on the recognised stock exchange. In case the instruments are not  traded on any stock exchange, valuation is carried out based on the latest NAV (not older than 1 year)  submitte d by the trust.     h)   Investments in Government guaranteed Security Receipts (‘SRs’) are valued periodically by reckoning the  Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset Reconstruction Company (‘ARC’) based on the recovery ratings  received for such instruments. Any Government guaranteed SRs outstanding after the final settlement of the  Government guarantee or the expiry of the guarantee period, whichever is earlier, are valued at  one rupee (₹1).       Investments in other SRs are valued as per the NAV declared by the issuing ARC or net book value of loans  transferred or estimated recoverable value based on Bank’s internal assessment on case to case basis,  whichever is lower. Investments in such Security Receipts where original maturity period has expired are  valued at  one rupee (₹1).       In case of investments in SRs which are backed by more than 10 percent of the stressed assets sold by the  Bank, the valuation of such SRs is additionally subject to a floor of face value of the SRs reduced by the  provisioning rate as per the extant asset classification and provisioning norms as applicable to the underlying  loans, assuming that the loan notionally continued in the boo ks of the Bank.   Investment asset classification a nd provisioning   Investments under HTM, AFS and FVTPL category are subjected to income recognition, asset classification and  provisioning norms of RBI. Non-performing Investments (NPIs) are identified and provision is made thereon in the  Profit and Loss account, as per the RBI guidelines. Once an investment become NPI, the Bank segregates it from rest of  the portfolio and does not consider it for netting valuation gains and losses. A NPI investment is segregated from other  investments within the same category [i.e., HTM, AFS, or FVTPL] under which it was classified at initial recognition.  Interest on NPIs is not recognized in the Profit and Loss Account until received. MTM appreciation in case of NPIs over  and above the book value is not recogniz ed and ignored.   Reclassification bet ween categories   Reclassification of investments between categories (viz. HTM, AFS and FVTPL) if any is carried out only after, prior  approval of Board of Directors and RBI and the same is accounted for in accordance with the  RBI guidelines.   Short sales   In accordance with the RBI guidelines, the Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central Government dated  securities. Such short positions are categorised under FVTPL category and netted off from investments in the Balance  Sheet. These positions are marked-to-market along with the other securities under FVTPL portfolio and the resultant  MTM gains/losses are accounted for as per the relevant RBI guidelines for valuation  of investments.

In the case  of a sale transaction, the Bank sells the fulfilment of priority sector obligation and in the case of a purchase transaction  the Bank buys the fulfilment of priority sector obligation through the RBI trading platform. There is no transfer of loan  assets in PSL C transactions. 5.7   Translation of Foreign  Currency items   In respect of domestic operations, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for at the rates  prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the closing  rates of exchange as notified by the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (‘FEDAI’). All profits/losses resulting  from year end revaluations are recognised in the Profit an d Loss Account.   Financial statements of foreign branches classified as non-integral foreign operations as per the RBI guidelines, are  transla ted as follows:   •   Assets and liabilities (both monetary and non-monetary as well as contingent liabilities) are translated at closing  exchange rates notified by FEDAI at the Bala nce Sheet date.   •   Income and expenses are translated at the rates prevailing on the date of th e transactions.   •   All resulting exchange differences are accumulated in a separate ‘Foreign Currency Translation Reserve’ (FCTR) till  the disposal of the net investments. Any realised gains or losses on such disposal are recognised in the Profit and  Loss Account except for those that relate to repatriation of accumulated profits which are reclassified from FCTR  to ‘Balance in Profit and Loss Account’ under Schedule 2 – Reserves and Surplus in the  Balance Sheet.   Contingent liabilities on account of forward exchange and derivative contracts, guarantees, acceptances, endorsements  and other obligations denominated in foreign currencies are disclosed at closing rates of exchange not ified by FEDAI. 5.8   Foreign exchange and deriv ative contracts   Derivative transactions comprise of forward contracts, swaps, FRAs, futures and options which are disclosed as  contingent liabilities. The forwards, swaps and options are categorised as trading or hedg e transactions.   Trad ing derivatives   Trading derivative contracts are revalued based on actual traded and/or derived from curves published by external  market sources or FBIL with the resulting unrealised gain or loss being recognised in the Profit and Loss Account  and correspondingly in other assets (representing positive MTM) and in other liabilities (representing negative MTM )  on  a gross basis.   Outstanding forward exchange contracts including tom/spot contracts (excluding swaps undertaken to hedge foreign  currency assets/liabilities and funding swaps) as at Balance Sheet date are revalued at closing spot and forward rates as  applicable as notified by FEDAI/FBIL and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. Valuation is considered  on present value basis by discounting the forward value till cash date using Alternative Reference Rate (‘ARR’) curve and  converting the foreign currency amount using the respective spot rates as notified by FEDAI/FBIL. The resulting gains  or losses on revaluation are included in the Profit an d Loss Account.   Currency futures contracts are mark-to-market, using the daily settlement price on a trading day, which is the closing  price of the respective futures contracts on that day. While the daily settlement price is computed based on the last  half an hour weighted average price of such contracts, the final settlement price is taken as the RBI reference rate on  the last trading day of the futures contracts or as may be specified by the relevant authority from time to time. All  open positions are marked-to-market based on the settlement price and the resultant MTM profit/loss is daily settled  wit h the exchange.

Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of a fixed asset on straight-line method from the date of addition.  The Management believes that depreciation rates currently used, fairly reflect its estimate of the useful lives and  residual values of fixed assets based on the historical experience of the Bank, though these rates in certain cases are  different from those prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Whenever there is a revision of the  estimated useful life of an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the revised remaining useful life  of  the said asset. Asset Estimated useful life As per Companies Act, 2013 Leased Land As per the term of the agreement - Owned premises 60 years 60 years Furniture and Fittings including interior 9 years to 10 years 10 years Office/Electrical equipment and installations 5 years to 10 years 5 years to 10 years Application software 5 years - Vehicles 4 years 8 years Computer hardware including printers 3 years 3 years CCTV and video conferencing equipment 3 years 5 years   Assets costing less than  ` 5,000 individually are fully depreciated in the ye ar of purchase.

An impairment loss is recognised wherever the carrying amount of an  asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s net selling price and value  in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value at the weighted  average cost of capital. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its  remaini ng useful life. 5.12   Non -banking assets   Non-banking assets (‘NBAs’) acquired in satisfaction of claims include land.

Define d benefit plans   The Bank has defined benefit plans in the form of provident fund, gratuity and resettlement allowance. Provident and  Gratuity are in the nature of funded defined benefit plans and resettlement allowance is in the nature of unfunded  define d benefit plan.   •   Provident Fund     Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined benefit plan wherein the contributions are charged  to the Profit and Loss Account of the year when such contributions are due and when services are rendered  by the employees. Further, an actuarial valuation is conducted by an independent actuary using the Projected  Unit Credit Method as at 31 March each year to determine the deficiency, if any, in the interest payable on the  contributions as compared to the interest liability as per the statutory rate declared by the Central Government  and the shortfall, if any, due to fluctuations in price or impairment, in the aggregate asset values of the Trust as  compared to the market value. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately recognised in the Profit and Loss Account  and ar e not deferred.     The overseas branches of the Bank and its eligible employees contribute a certain percentage of their salary  towards respective government schemes as per local regulat ory guidelines.   •   Gratuity     The Bank contributes towards gratuity fund (defined benefit retirement plan) administered by various insurers for  eligible employees. Under this scheme, the settlement obligation remains with the Bank, although the insurers  administer the scheme and determine the contribution premium required to be paid by the Bank. The plan  provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement or termination of employment based on the  respective employee’s salary and the years of employment with the Bank. The liability with regard to the gratuity  fund is recognised based on actuarial valuation conducted by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit  Credit Method as at each reporting date based on certain assumptions regarding rate of interest, salary growth,  mortality and staff attrition. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately recognized in the Profit and Loss Account and  ar e not deferred.     The Code on Social Security 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment  received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. Pending  notification of the Code and issuance of the final rules/interpretation, the Bank has adopted a prudent policy for  recognition of provision in respect of the gratuity liability under the Code over and above the provisions made  in the normal course based on the extant rules. Such provision is determined as at each reporting date, based on  actuarial valuation conducted by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit  Credit Method.     In respect of employees at overseas branches (other than expatriates), the liability with regard to gratuity is  provided on the basis of a prescribed method as per local laws, where ver applicable.   •   Resettl ement Allowance     The Bank provides for resettlement allowance liability in the form of six months’ pay at the time of separation, for  certain eligible employees who moved to the Bank as part of the Citibank India Consumer Business acquisition.

Standalone financial statements 357 Projected Unit Credit Method as at 31 March each year based on certain assumptions regarding discount rate and  salary e scalation rate.   Defined Con tribution plans   •   Superannuation     Employees of the Bank (other than those who moved to the Bank as part of the Citibank India Consumer Business  acquisition) are entitled to receive retirement benefits under the Bank’s superannuation scheme either under a  cash-out option through salary or under a defined contribution plan. Through this defined contribution plan, the  Bank contributes annually a sum equal to 10% of the employee’s eligible annual basic salary to the Life Insurance  Corporation of India (LIC), which undertakes to pay the lump sum and annuity benefit payments pursuant to the  scheme. Such contributions are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account in the period in whi ch they accrue.     Eligible employees who moved to the Bank as part of the Citibank India Consumer Business acquisition are entitled  to receive a lumpsum corpus amount under a separate superannuation scheme with vesting criteria of 10 years as  a defined contribution plan. Through this plan, the Bank makes a defined contribution annually of a sum equal to  15% of such employee’s eligible annual basic salary to a Superannuation Trust, which undertakes to pay the lump  sum payments pursuant to the scheme after the vesting period. Such contributions are recognised in the Profit and  Loss Account in the period in whi ch they accrue.   •   National Pension  Scheme (‘NPS’)     In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the NPS, the Bank contributes a certain percentage of the  total basic salary of such employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined contribution plan, which is managed and  administered by pension fund management companies. Such contributions are recognised in the Profit and Loss  Account in the period in whi ch they accrue. 5.1 5   Reward points   The Bank runs a loyalty program which seeks to recognize and reward customers based on their relationship with  the Bank. Under the program, eligible customers are granted loyalty points redeemable in future, subject to certain  conditions. In addition, the Bank continues to grant reward points in respect of certain credit cards (not covered under  the loyalty program). The Bank estimates the provision for such loyalty/reward points using an actuarial method at the  Balance Sheet date through an independent actuary, basis assumptions such as redemption rate, lapse rate, discount  rate, value of reward points etc. Provision for the said reward points is then made based on the actuarial valuation  report as furnished by the said indep endent actuary. 5.16   Taxation   Income tax expense is the aggregate amount of current tax and deferred tax charge. Current year taxes are determined  in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and considering the material principles set out in  the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards to the extent applicable. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact  of current year timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the year and reversal of timing  differences of  earlier years.   Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance  Sheet date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off assets  against liabilities representing current tax and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to the taxes on  income levied by same governing  taxation laws.   Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised. The impact of changes in the deferred  tax assets and liabilities is recognised in the Profit an d Loss Account.   Deferred tax assets are recognised and reassessed at each reporting date, based upon the Management’s judgement  as to whether realisation is considered as reasonably certain. Deferred tax assets are recognised on carry forward of  unabsorbed depreciation and tax losses only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that such  deferred tax asset can be realised against  future profits. 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 358 5.17   Share  issue expenses   Share issue expenses are adjusted from the Share Premium Account in terms of Section 52 of the Compa nies Act, 2013. 5.18   Corporate Social  Responsibility   Expenditure towards Corporate Social Responsibility is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account in accordance with  the provisions of the Compa nies Act, 2013. 5.19   Ear nings per share   The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share, as notified under  Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies  (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstandin g for the year.   Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity  shares were exercised or converted during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average  number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end except where the results  are  anti-dilutive. 5.20   Employee stock opt ion/unit scheme   The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) provides for grant of stock options on equity shares of the Bank to  employees and Directors, of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under the Scheme, options are granted at an exercise price,  which is equal to the fair market price of the underlying equity shares at the date of the grant. The fair market price is  the latest available closing price, prior to the date of grant, on the stock exchange on which the shares of the Bank are  listed. If the shares are listed on more than one stock exchange, then the stock exchange where there is highest trading  volume on the said date  is considered.   Further, the Employees Stock Unit Scheme (‘the ESU Scheme’) provides for grant of stock units convertible into  equivalent number of fully paid-up equity share(s) of the Bank to eligible employees. The stock units are granted at an  exercise price as determined by the Bank and specified at the time of grant which shall not be less than the face value  of the equity shar es of the Bank.   As per RBI guidelines, for options/units granted after 31 March, 2021, the Bank follows the fair value method and  recognizes the fair value of such options/units computed using the Black-Scholes model without reducing estimated  forfeitures, as compensation expense over the vesting period. On exercise of the stock options/units, the corresponding  balance under Employee Stock Options/Units Outstanding account is transferred to the Share Premium account. In  respect of the options/units which expire unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of Employee Stock Options/ Units Outstanding account is transferred to the General Reserve. In respect of Employee Stock Options/Units which are  granted to the employees of the subsidiaries, the Bank recovers the cost from the subsidiaries over the  vesting period. 5.21   Provisions, contingent liabilities and co ntingent assets   In accordance with AS-29 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, provision is recognised when the  Bank has a present obligation as a result of past event where it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required  to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are not discounted to its present  value and are determined based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date. These  are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current  best estimates.   A disclosure of contingent liability is made  when there is:   •   a possible obligation arising from a past event, the existence of which will be confirmed by occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not within the control  of the Bank; or   •   a present obligation arising from a past event which is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow of resources  will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation  cannot be made.   When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is  remote, no provision or disc losure is made. 

Standalone financial statements 359   Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually  and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in  the period in which the  change occurs. 5.22   Accounti ng for dividend   As per AS-4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance Sheet date’ as notified by the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, the Bank does not account for proposed dividend  as a liability through appropriation from the Profit and Loss Account. The same is recognised in the year of actual  payout post approval of the shareholders. However, the Bank considers proposed dividend in determining capital funds  in computing the capital adequacy ratio as on the  reporting date. 5.23   Cash and c ash equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, rupee digital currency, balances with RBI, balances with other banks  and money at call an d short notice. 5.24   Se gment Reporting   The disclosure relating to segment information is made in accordance with AS-17: ‘Segment Reporting’ and relevant  guidelines iss ued by the RBI.

Classification of assets and liabilities under the different maturity buckets is based on the same estimates and  assumptions as used by the Bank for compiling the return submitted to the RBI, which has been relied upon  by the auditors.   2.   Includes foreign currency balances.   3.   For the purpose of disclosing the maturity pattern, advances that have been subject to risk participation vide Inter- Bank Participation Certificates (‘IBPCs’) and Funded Risk Participation (‘FRPs’) have been classified in the maturity  bucket corresponding to the contractual maturities of IBPC/FRP instruments.   4.   Maturity profile of foreign currency assets and liabilities excludes off balance sheet items.   5.   Listed equity investments (except strategic investments) have been considered at 50% haircut as per RBI directions. b)   Disclosure on Liquidity Coverage Ratio   Qualitative disclosure   The Bank has adopted the Basel III framework on liquidity standards as prescribed by RBI and has put in place  requisite systems and processes to enable periodical computation and reporting of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio  (LCR). The mandated regulatory threshold is embedded into the Risk Appetite Statement of the Bank thus subjecting  LCR maintenance to Board oversight and periodical review. The Bank computes the LCR and reports the same to  

Standalone financial statements 363 the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) every month for review as well as to the Risk Management  Committee of the Board.   The Bank computes LCR on a daily basis and in accordance with RBI guidelines the quarterly disclosures of LCR contain  data on the simple average calculated on daily observations over the quarter.   The Bank follows the criteria laid down by RBI for calculation of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), gross outflows  and inflows within the next 30-day period. HQLA predominantly comprises Government securities viz. Treasury Bills,  Central and State Government securities. A relatively smaller part of HQLA is accounted for by the corporate bonds  with mandated haircuts applied thereto.   The Bank monitors the concentration of funding sources from significant counterparties, significant instruments/ products as part of the asset liability management framework. The Bank adheres to the regulatory and internal limits  on Inter-bank liability and call money borrowings which form part of the ALM policy. The Bank’s funding sources are  fairly dispersed across sources and maturities.   Expected derivative cash outflows and inflows are calculated for outstanding contracts in accordance with laid down  valuation methodologies. Cash flows, if any, from collaterals posted against derivatives are not considered.   Apart from the LCR position in all currencies put together, the Bank monitors the LCR in US Dollar currency which  qualifies as a significant currency as per RBI guidelines.   The liquidity management of the Bank is undertaken by the Asset Liability Management group in the Treasury department  in accordance with the Board approved policies and ALCO approved funding plans. The Risk department measures  and monitors the liquidity profile of the Bank with reference to the Board approved limits, for both domestic as well  as overseas operations, on a static as well as on a dynamic basis by using the gap analysis technique supplemented  by monitoring of key liquidity ratios and periodical liquidity stress testing. Periodical reports are placed before the  Bank’s ALCO for perusal and review. As per RBI guidelines, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum of 100% of  Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which was applicable for all the quarters for the financial years ending on 31 March, 2025 and  31 March, 2024.   All significant outflows and inflows determined in accordance with RBI guidelines are included in the prescribed LCR  computation template.

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 392     Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from an underlying asset, or from interest  and exchange rates or indices. The Bank undertakes Over the Counter (OTC) and Exchange Traded derivative  transactions for Balance Sheet management and also for proprietary trading/market making whereby the Bank  offers OTC derivative products to the customers to enable them to hedge their interest rate and currency risks  within the prevalent regulatory guidelines.      Proprietary trading includes Exchange Traded Currency Options, Interest Rate Futures, Currency Futures and  Rupee Interest Rate Swaps under different benchmarks (viz. MIBOR, Modified MIFOR, LIBOR, ARR and INBMK),  Currency Options, Currency Swaps and Non Deliverable derivatives. The Bank also undertakes transactions  in Cross Currency Swaps, Principal Only Swaps, Coupon Only Swaps, Currency Options, Interest Rate Swaps,  Exotic Derivatives and Long Term Forex Contracts (LTFX) for hedging its Balance Sheet and also offers them  to its customers. These transactions expose the Bank to various risks, primarily credit, market, legal, reputation  and operational risk. The Bank has adopted the following mechanism for managing risks arising out of the  derivative transactions.     There is a functional separation between the Treasury Front Office, Treasury Mid Office and Treasury Back Office  to undertake derivative transactions. The customer and interbank related derivative transactions are originated  by Derivative sales and Treasury Front Office team respectively which ensures compliance with the trade  origination requirements as per the Bank’s policy and the RBI guidelines. The Market Risk Group within the Bank’s  Risk Department independently identifies, measures and monitors the market risks associated with derivative  transactions and apprises the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Management Committee  of the Board (RMC) on the compliance with the risk limits. The Treasury Back Office undertakes activities such as  trade validation, confirmation, settlement, ISDA and related documentation, post deal documentation, accounting,  valuation and other MIS reporting.     The derivative transactions are governed by the Derivative policy, Suitability and Appropriateness Policy  for derivative products, Market Risk Management policy, Hedging policy and the Asset Liability Management  (ALM) policy of the Bank as well as by the extant RBI guidelines. The Bank has implemented policy on customer  suitability & appropriateness to ensure that derivatives transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable  to the customer. The Bank has put in place a detailed process flow on documentation for customer derivative  transactions for effective management of operational/reputation/compliance risk.     Various risk limits are set up and actual exposures are monitored vis-à-vis the limits allocated. These limits are set  up taking into account market volatility, risk appetite, business strategy and management experience. Risk limits  are in place for risk parameters viz. PV01, VaR, Stop Loss, Delta, Gamma and Vega. Actual positions are monitored  against these limits on a daily basis and breaches, if any, are dealt with in accordance with board approved Risk  Appetite Statement. Risk assessment of the portfolio is undertaken periodically. The Bank ensures that the Gross  PV01 (Price value of a basis point) position arising out of all non-option rupee derivative contracts are within  0.25% of net worth of the Bank as on Balance Sheet date.     Hedging transactions are undertaken by the Bank to protect the variability in the fair value or the cash flow of the  underlying Balance Sheet item. These transactions are tested for hedge effectiveness and in case any transaction  fails the test, the same is re-designated as a trading deal and appropriate accounting treatment is followed.   (b)     Accounting policy for recording hedge and non-hedge transactions, recognition of income, premiums and  discounts, valuation of outstanding contracts     Derivative transactions comprise of forward contracts, swaps, FRAs, futures and options which are disclosed as  contingent liabilities. These are categorised as trading or hedge transactions.     Trading derivative contracts are revalued based on actual traded and/or derived from curves published by external  market sources or FBIL with the resulting unrealised gain or loss being recognised in the Profit and Loss Account  and correspondingly in other assets (representing positive MTM) and in other liabilities (representing negative  MTM) on a gross basis. The premium on option contracts is accounted for as per FEDAI guidelines.     The Hedging Policy of the Bank governs the use of derivatives for hedging purpose. Subject to the prevailing RBI  guidelines, the Bank deals in derivatives for hedging fixed rate and floating rate coupon or foreign currency assets/ liabilities. Transactions for hedging and market making purposes are recorded separately.  

Standalone financial statements 393     Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading (including funding swaps), that are entered into to  establish the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are  outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. The premium or discount  arising at the inception of such forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line basis as expense or  income over the life of the contract.     For hedge transactions through other derivatives, the Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at  the inception of transaction itself. The effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and  periodically thereafter. In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and  hedged items are recognized in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow hedges, the change in fair  value of hedging instrument for the effective portion is recognised in Schedule 2- ‘Reserves and Surplus’ under  ‘Cash Flow Hedge Reserve’ and the ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised  in the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the Cash Flow Hedge Reserve, in an effective hedging  relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is  recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.     Derivative transactions are covered under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master  agreements with respective counterparties. The exposure on account of derivative transactions is computed as  per the RBI guidelines and is marked against the Loan Equivalent Risk (LER) limits approved for the respective  counterparties.   (c)   Provisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation     In accordance with RBI guidelines, any receivables (crystallised receivables and positive MTM) under derivatives  contracts, which remain overdue for more than 90 days, are reversed through the Profit and Loss Account and are  held in a separate Suspense account.       Collateral requirements for derivative transactions are laid down as part of credit sanction terms on a case by case  basis. Such collateral requirements are determined, based on usual credit appraisal process. The Bank retains the  right to terminate transactions as a risk mitigation measure in certain cases.     The credit risk in respect of customer derivative transactions is sought to be mitigated through a laid down policy  on sanction of Loan Equivalent Risk (LER) limits, monitoring mechanism for LER limits and trigger events for  escalation/margin calls/termination.

To achieve this, the following principles are adopted:  

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 400     Affordability: Pay to reflect productivity improvements to retain cost-income competitiveness      -   Maintain competitiveness on fixed pay in talent market      -   Pay for performance to drive meritocracy through variable pay      -   Employee Stock Units (ESUs) and Employee Stock Options (ESOPs) for long-term value creation      -   Benefits and perquisites to remain aligned with market practices and provide flexibility     Apart from the above, the compensation structure for MD & CEO, WTDs, Material Risk Takers and employees  at the grade of Senior Vice President and above within the Assurance functions at the Bank is aligned to RBI’s  guidelines for sound compensation practices issued in November 2019 and addresses the general principles of:      -   Effective and independent governance and monitoring of compensation     -     Alignment of compensation with prudent risk-taking through well designed and consistent  compensation structures     -   Clear and timely disclosure to facilitate supervisory oversight by all stakeholders     Accordingly, the compensation policy for MD & CEO and WTDs seeks to:     a)     Ensure that the compensation, in terms of structure and total amount, is in line with the best practices, as well  as competitive vis-à-vis that of peer banks     b)     Establish the linkage of compensation with individual performance as well as achievement of the corporate  objectives of the Bank     c)     Include an appropriate variable pay component tied to the achievement of pre-established objectives in line  with Bank’s scorecard while ensuring that the compensation is aligned with prudent risk taking     d)     Encourage attainment of long term shareholder returns through inclusion of equity linked long-term incentives  as part of compensation     Compensation is structured in terms of fixed pay, cash variable pay and share linked instruments (for selective  employees), with a strong linkage of variable pay to performance. The remuneration policy of the Bank is approved  by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors of the Bank. Additional approval  from Shareholders and RBI is obtained specifically for compensation of MD & CEO and WTDs.      Whether the remuneration committee reviewed the firm’s remuneration policy during the past year, and if so, an  overview of any changes that were made:     The Bank’s remuneration policy was originally reviewed and approved by the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee and Board of Directors in FY2021 in order to align with RBI guidelines. The remuneration policy of the  Bank is reviewed annually and any changes arising therefrom are approved by the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee and Board of Directors.     Key highlights of the policy are mentioned below:     •   At least 50% of total compensation i.e. Fixed Pay plus Total Variable Pay shall be variable.     •   Value of share linked instruments will be included in definition of ‘Total Variable Pay’     •     ‘Total Variable Pay’ for the MD & CEO/ Whole-time Directors/ Material Risk Takers of the Bank would be  capped at 300% of Fixed Pay.       •     If the ‘Total Variable Pay’ is up to 200% of the Fixed Pay, a minimum of 50% of the Variable pay; and in case  Variable Pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the Variable Pay shall be paid via employee stock options.     •     Minimum 60% of the ‘Total Variable Pay’ shall be deferred over 3 years. If cash component is part of ‘Total  Variable Pay’, at least 50% of the cash component of variable pay should also be deferred over 3 years. In  cases where the cash component of Total Variable pay is under  ` . 25 lakh, variable pay shall not be deferred.      •   All the fixed items of compensation, including retiral benefits and perquisites, will be treated as part of Fixed Pay. 

Standalone financial statements 401     •   Qualitative and quantitative criteria defined for identification of Material Risk Takers (MRTs).     •   Specific guidelines on application of malus and clawback clauses.      A discussion of how the Bank ensures that risk, internal audit and compliance employees are remunerated  independently of the businesses they oversee:     The Bank ensures that risk, internal audit and compliance employees are remunerated independently of the  businesses they oversee and is guided by the individual employee performance. The remuneration is determined  on the basis of relevant risk measures included in the Balanced Scorecard / key deliverables of staff in these  functions. The parameters reviewed for performance-based rewards are independent of performance of the  business area they oversee and commensurate with their individual role in the Bank. Additionally, the ratio of fixed  and variable compensation is weighed towards fixed compensation in case of employees in risk, internal audit, and  compliance functions.  c)   Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes:      An overview of the key risks that the Bank takes into account when implementing remuneration measures:     The business activity of the Bank is undertaken within the limits of risk measures to achieve the financial plan. The  Financial Perspective in the Bank’s Balanced Score Card (BSC) contains metrics pertaining to growth, profitability  and asset quality. These metrics along with other metrics in customer, internal process and compliance and people  perspective are taken into account while arriving at the remuneration decisions. The metrics on internal process  and compliance ensure due weightage to non – financial risk that bank may be exposed to. The Remuneration  Policy also contains provisions whereby the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Bank may review  and approve the invoking of malus and/or clawback of compensation elements pertaining to the MD & CEO,  WTDs and other Material Risk Takers of the Bank, including consideration of facts on a case to case basis and  application of internal and external benchmarks.      An overview of the nature and type of key measures used to take account of these risks, including risk  difficult to measure:     The Bank has a robust system of measuring and reviewing these risks. The risk parameters are a part of the  BSC used for setting of performance objectives and for measuring performance which includes, besides financial  performance, adherence to internal processes, compliance and people perspectives. Weightage is placed on  not only financial or quantitative achievement of objectives but also on qualitative aspects detailing how the  objectives were achieved.      A discussion of the ways in which these measures affect remuneration:     The relevant risk measures are included in the scorecards of MD & CEO and WTDs. Inclusion of the above mentioned  measures ensures that performance parameters are aligned to risk measures at the time of performance evaluation.  The Nomination and Remuneration Committee takes into consideration all the above aspects while assessing  organisational and individual performance and making compensation related recommendations to the Board.        A discussion of how the nature and type of these measures have changed over the past year and reasons for the  changes, as well as the impact of changes on remuneration:     The Bank continued to track key metrics across financial, customer, internal process and compliance and people  perspective as part of FY 25 BSC. For FY 2024-25, metrics linked to Bank’s strategy, with focus on health metrics,  sustainability, specifically on capital position and building distinctiveness were incorporated. Further, critical  deliverables were included to drive progress as per the Bank’s Growth, Profitability Score strategy.   d)     Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement period  with levels of remuneration:     The Bank’s performance management and compensation philosophies are structured to support the achievement  of the Bank’s on-going business objectives by rewarding achievement of objectives linked directly to its strategic  business priorities. These strategic priorities are cascaded through annualised objectives to the employees.  

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 402     The Bank follows the Balanced Scorecard approach in designing its performance management system. Adequate  attention is given to the robust goal setting process to ensure alignment of individual objectives to support the  achievement of business strategy, financial and non-financial goals across and through the organisation. The non- financial goals for employees include customer service, process improvement, adherence to risk and compliance  norms, operations and process control, learning and knowledge development.      An overview of main performance metrics for Bank, top level business lines and individuals:     The Bank follows a Balanced Scorecard approach for measuring performance for the Bank, top business lines  and individuals.       A discussion of how amounts of individual remuneration are linked to the Bank-wide and individual performance:     The Bank’s remuneration practices are underpinned by principles of meritocracy and fairness. The remuneration  system strives to maintain the ability to attract, retain, reward and motivate the talent in order to enable the Bank  to attain its strategic objectives within the increasingly competitive context in which it operates. The Bank’s pay- for-performance approach strives to ensure both internal and external equity in line with emerging market trends.  However, the business model and affordability form the overarching boundary conditions.     The Bank follows a Balanced Scorecard approach for measuring performance at senior levels. The Balanced  Scorecard parameters for individuals are cascaded from the Bank’s Balanced Scorecard. The Nomination and  Remuneration Committee reviews the achievements against the set of parameters which determines the  performance of the individuals.     For all other employees, performance appraisals are conducted annually and initiated by the employee with self- appraisal. The immediate supervisor reviews the appraisal ratings in a joint consultation meeting with the employee  and assigns the performance rating. The final ratings are discussed by a Moderation Committee comprising of  senior officials of the Bank. Both relative and absolute individual performances are considered for the moderation  process. Individual fixed pay increases, variable pay, ESUs and ESOPs are linked to the final performance ratings.       A discussion of the measures the Bank will in general implement to adjust remuneration in the event that  performance metrics are weak:     In cases where the performance metrics are weak or not well defined to measure the performance effectively,  the Bank uses discretion to reward such employees. The remuneration is then influenced by the operational  performance parameters of the Bank along with individual performance achievement.       Whilst determining fixed and variable remuneration, relevant risk measures are included in scorecards of  senior employees.     As a prudent measure, for Material Risk Takers, a portion of variable pay if it exceeds a certain threshold is deferred  and is paid proportionately over a period of 3 years. The deferred variable pay amount of reference year would be  held back in case of any misrepresentation or gross inaccuracy resulting in a wrong risk assessment. e)     Description of the bank’s policy on deferral and vesting of variable remuneration and a discussion of the bank’s policy  and criteria for adjusting deferred remuneration before vesting and after vesting.:   i)   Bank’s policy on deferral and vesting of variable remuneration:     For MD&CEO, WTDs and other Material Risk Takers of the Bank, minimum 60% of the Total Variable Pay  (including Cash Variable Pay and Stock Options) is deferred over 3 years or such other period as prescribed by  RBI where applicable. In case the cash component is part of Total Variable Pay and exceeds  `  25 lakhs, at least  50% of the cash component of variable pay is also deferred over 3 years or such other period as prescribed by RBI  where applicable.     The Total Variable Pay for MD&CEO, WTDs and other Material Risk Takers of the Bank is subject to malus and  clawback clauses, as defined in the Remuneration Policy of the Bank. 

Standalone financial statements 403   ii)   Bank’s policy and criteria for adjusting deferred remuneration before vesting and after vesting through claw  back arrangements:      The Total Variable Pay for MD&CEO, WTDs and other Material Risk Takers of the Bank is subject to malus and  clawback clauses, which are defined in the Remuneration Policy of the Bank. Detailed scenarios under which  said clauses can be applied, such as event of an enquiry determining gross negligence or breach of integrity, or  significant deterioration in financial performance are defined in the Remuneration Policy of the Bank. f)     Description of the different forms of variable remuneration that the Bank utilizes and the rationale for using these  different forms:      An overview of the forms of variable remuneration offered:     •     Variable Pay: Variable Pay is linked to corporate performance, business performance and individual  performance and ensures differential pay based on the performance levels of employees     •     Employee Stock Options (ESOPs): ESOPs are given to selective set of employees at senior levels based on  their level of performance and role. ESOP scheme has an inbuilt deferred vesting design which helps in  directing long term performance orientation among employees.     •     Employee Stock Units (ESUs): ESUs are given to employees between the grades of AVP and SVP II based on  their level of performance. The ESU scheme has an inbuilt deferred vesting design which helps in directing  long term performance orientation among employees.      A discussion of the use of different forms of variable remuneration  including a description of the factors that  determine the mix and their relative importance:      Variable pay in the form of performance based bonus is paid out annually and is linked to performance achievement  against balanced performance measures and aligned with the principles of meritocracy. The proportion of variable  pay in total pay shall be higher at senior management levels. The payment of all forms of variable pay is governed by  the affordability of the Bank and based on profitability and cost income ratios. At senior management levels (and  for certain employees with potential to cause material impact on risk exposure), a portion of variable compensation  may be paid out in a deferred manner in order to drive prudent behaviour as well as long term & sustainable  performance orientation. Long term variable pay is administered in the form of ESOPs and ESUs with an objective  of enabling employee participation in the business as an active stakeholder and to usher in an ‘owner-manager’  culture. The quantum of grant of stock options is determined and approved by the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee, in terms of the said Regulations and in line with best practices, subject to the approval of RBI. The  current ESOP and ESU design has an inbuilt deferral intended to spread and manage risk.

Fair Value Methodology   In line with RBI clarification on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/Chief Executive Officers/ Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff issued on 30 August, 2021, the Bank follows the fair value method  for all share-linked instruments granted after 31 March, 2021 and consequently recognizes the fair value of options  computed using the Black-Scholes model, without reducing estimated forfeitures, as a compensation expense over the  vesting period. During the year, the Bank has recognised compensation cost of  ` 365.79 crores (previous year  ` 400.70  crores)  for options/units granted to employees of the Bank and recovered  ` 58.18 crores (previous year  ` 53.63 crores)  from group entities in respect of options/units granted to the employees and deputed staff at group entities. 

Standalone financial statements 411   The fair value of the options/units is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes options pricing model,  with the following assumptions: 31 March, 2025 31 March, 2024 ESOP ESU ESOP ESU Dividend yield 0.09% 0.09% 0.26% 0.26% Expected life 2.95-5.95 years 1-3 years 2.95-5.95 years 1-3 years Risk free interest rate 6.85% to 7.09% 6.95% to 7.06% 6.79% to 7.17% 6.94% to 7.12% Volatility 24.00% to 29.15% 19.89% to 24.01% 29.90% to 38.27% 25.28% to 31.99%   Volatility is the measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period.  The measure of volatility used in the Black-Scholes options pricing model is the annualised standard deviation of the  continuously compounded rates of return on the stock over a period of time. For calculating volatility, the daily volatility  of the stock prices on the National Stock Exchange, over a period prior to the date of grant, corresponding with the  expected life of the options has been considered.   The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 March, 2025 is  ` 358.68 (previous  year  ` 297.95).    The weighted average fair value of units granted during the year ended 31 March, 2025 is  ` 1,059.51  (previous year  ` 842.45). 2.3   Proposed Dividend   The Board of Directors, in their meeting held on 24 April, 2025 have proposed a final dividend of   ` 1 per equity share  amounting to  ` 309.74 crores.  The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.  In terms of revised Accounting Standard (AS) 4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance sheet date’  as notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, such  proposed dividend has not been recognised as a liability as on 31 March, 2025.   During the year, the Bank paid final dividend of  ` 1 per equity share amounting  ` 309.09 crores pertaining to the previous  year ended 31 March, 2024. 2.4   Segmental reporting   The business of the Bank is divided into four segments: Treasury, Retail Banking, Corporate/Wholesale Banking and  Other Banking Business.

These also include demands raised by tax authorities and other statutory authorities which  are disputed by the Bank. The Bank holds provision of  ` 896.77 crores as on 31 March, 2025 (previous year  ` 369.37  crores) towards claims assessed as probable.   b)   Liability for partly paid investments     This represents amounts remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.    c)   Liability on account of forward exchange contracts      The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, including non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts on its own  account and on OTC for customers. Forward exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency  at a future date at the contracted rate. A non-deliverable forward contract is a currency derivatives contract to  exchange cash flows between the contracted forward exchange rate and prevailing spot rates. The amount of  contingent liability represents the notional principal of respective forward exchange contracts. With respect to  the transactions entered into with its customers, the Bank generally enters into off-setting transactions in the  inter-bank market. This results in generation of a higher number of outstanding transactions, and hence a large  value of gross notional principal of the portfolio, while the net market risk is lower.   d)   Liability on account of derivative contracts      The Bank enters into derivative contracts in the form of currency options/swaps, exchange traded currency options,  non-deliverable derivatives and  interest rate/ currency futures on its own account and on OTC for customers.  Currency swaps are commitments between two counterparties to exchange streams of interest payments and/or  principal amounts in different currencies on specified dates over the duration of the swap at a pre-agreed exchange  rate. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. Interest rate  futures are standardised, exchange-traded contracts that represent a pledge to undertake a certain interest rate  transaction at a specified price, on a specified future date. Forward rate agreements (FRA) are financial contracts  between two counterparties, in which a buyer will pay or receive, on the settlement date, the difference between  a pre-determined fixed rate (FRA rate) and a reference interest rate, applied on a notional principal amount, for a  specified forward period. A foreign currency option is an agreement between two parties in which one grants to  the other the right to buy or sell a specified amount of currency at a specific price within a specified time period  or at a specified future time. An Exchange Traded Currency Option contract is a standardised foreign exchange  

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 430 derivative contract, which gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to exchange money denominated in  one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date on the date of expiry. A non- deliverable option contract is a currency derivatives contract that offers the right, but not the obligation to either  purchase or sell a currency against another currency and the contract is settled at the difference between the  contracted exchange rate and prevailing spot rate on the expiry date. Currency Futures contract is a standardised,  exchange-traded contract, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency at a certain date in the future, at a specified  price. The amount of contingent liability represents the notional principal of respective derivative contracts. With  respect to the transactions entered into with its customers, the Bank generally enters into off-setting transactions  in the inter-bank market. This results in generation of a higher number of outstanding transactions, and hence a  large value of gross notional principal of the portfolio, while the net market risk is lower.   e)   Guarantees given on behalf of constituents      As a part of its banking activities, the Bank issues guarantees on behalf of its customers to enhance their credit  standing. Guarantees represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of the  customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations. These are stated net of cash margin held with the  Bank as on the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.    f)   Acceptances, endorsements and other obligations     These include documentary credit issued by the Bank on behalf of its customers and bills drawn by the Bank’s  customers that are accepted or endorsed by the Bank. These are stated net of cash margin held with the Bank as  on the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.   g)   Other items for which the Bank is contingently liable     Other items represent outstanding amount of bills rediscounted by the Bank, estimated amount of contracts  remaining to be executed on capital account, notional principal on account of outstanding Tom/Spot foreign  exchange contracts, contracts for purchase of investments where settlement is due post balance sheet date, deed  of indemnity issued to liquidator of overseas subsidiary, contingent liability relating to undertakings issued towards  settlements under resolution plan in respect of non-performing assets, commitments towards underwriting and  investment in equity through bids under Initial Public Offering (IPO) of corporates, commitment for investment in  Associate entity and amount transferred to Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF).    The Bank has a process whereby periodically all long term contracts (including derivative contracts) are assessed for  material foreseeable losses. At the year end, the Bank has reviewed and recorded adequate provision as required under  any law/accounting standards for material foreseeable losses on such long term contracts (including derivative contracts)  in the books of account and disclosed the same under the relevant notes in the financial statements, where applicable. 3.

Consolidated financial statements 431 Independent Auditor’s Report To The Members of Axis Bank Limited Report on the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion 1.   We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of  Axis Bank Limited  (‘the Holding Company’  or ‘the Bank’), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), and its  associates, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the Consolidated Profit and Loss  Account, and the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended on that date, and notes to the Consolidated  Financial Statements, including a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (‘the  Consolidated Financial Statements’). 2.   In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the  consideration of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements and the other financial information  of such subsidiaries, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements give the information required by the Banking  Regulation Act, 1949, as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) and circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve  Bank of India (‘RBI’), in the manner so required for banking companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the  Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules,  2021 (‘AS’) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the Consolidated State of Affairs of the Group  at 31 March 2025, and its Consolidated Profit, and its Consolidated Cash Flow for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion 3.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (‘SAs’) specified under section 143(10) of the  Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code  of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are  relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act, and the rules thereunder,  and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, along with the consideration of audit reports of the other auditors  referred to in the ‘Other Matters’ paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the  Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Audit Matters 4.   Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate  opinion on these matters.   We have determined the matters described below to be the Key Audit Matters: Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit 1. Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting   As the Bank operates on Core Banking Solution across its  branches and asset centres, the reliability and security of  Information technology (“IT”) systems plays a key role in the  business operations. Since large volume of transactions are  processed daily, the IT controls are required to ensure that  applications process data as expected and that changes are  made in an appropriate manner. In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we  involved our specialists to understand the IT control environment, IT  infrastructure and IT systems. 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 432 Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit 1. Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting IT infrastructure is critical for smooth functioning and accurate  accounting and financial reporting process. Due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the IT  environment, we have ascertained key IT systems used in  financial reporting process and its related controls as a key audit  matter. We conducted an assessment and identified key IT systems that  are critical for accounting and financial reporting process and are  relevant for our audit and tested their internal controls. In particular: •     We obtained an understanding of the Bank’s IT control  environment and key changes during the audit period that may  be relevant to the audit; •     We tested the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of the Bank’s General IT controls over the  key IT systems that are critical to accounting and financial  reporting. This included evaluation of Bank’s controls for user  access management, program change management, database  management, network operations, incident management and  other IT operations performed by the Bank during the period  of audit; •     We tested key automated and manual business cycle controls  and logic for system generated reports relevant to the audit;  and •     We also tested compensating controls and performed alternate  procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT  risks that would materially impact the financial statements. 2. Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning on Advances (IRAC) as per the regulatory requirements. Total Loans and Advances (Net of Provision) as at 31 March 2025: INR 1,040,811 crore Provision for Non-Performing Advances as at 31 March 2025: INR 10,272.49 crore Refer Schedule 9, Schedule 17(5.3) and Schedule 18(1) Note 1.4 of Standalone Financial Statements   The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular issued  by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) on ‘Prudential Norms for  Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning  pertaining to Advances’ (the ‘IRAC norms’) and amendments  thereto (“RBI guidelines”) which prescribes the norms for  identification and classification of Non-performing Assets  (‘NPAs’) and the minimum provision required for such assets.   The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the  identification and provision required against NPAs considering  various quantitative as well as qualitative factors.   As the identification of and provisioning against NPAs requires  considerable level of management estimation, application of  various regulatory requirements and its significance to the  overall audit due to stakeholder and regulatory focus, we have  identified this as a key audit matter.   Our audit approach included testing the design, operating  effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit procedures  in respect of income recognition, asset classification and provisioning  pertaining to advances. In particular: •     We have evaluated and understood the Bank’s internal control  system in adhering to the RBI guidelines; •     We have analysed and understood key IT systems/ applications  used and tested the design and implementation and operational  effectiveness of relevant controls in relation to income  recognition, asset classification, viz., standard, sub-standard,  doubtful and loss with reference to RBI guidelines and  provisioning pertaining to advances; and •     We test checked advances to examine the validity and accuracy  of the recorded amounts, provision for NPAs, and compliance  with IRAC norms. •     Assessed appropriateness & the adequacy of disclosures as per  RBI guidelines relating to NPAs.

Based on consideration of their report, the following Key Audit Matter was included in their audit    report. Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit 1. Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting The Company’s key financial accounting and reporting  processes are highly dependent on the automated controls  over the Company’s information system, such that there exists  a risk that gaps in the Information Technology General Control  environment could result in a misstatement in the financial  accounting and reporting records. Accordingly, we have considered user access management,  segregation of duties and control over system change over  key financial accounting and reporting systems, as a key audit  matter. Our Audit Approach: With the assistance of our IT Specialists, we obtained an  understanding of the Company’s IT Applications, databases and  operating systems relevant to the financial reporting and the control  environment. Our audit approach was combination of test of internal controls and  substantive procedures on the areas of the IT infrastructure, which  majorly focused access security (including controls over privileged  access), program change controls, database management and  network operations. In particular, our activity included the following: General IT controls design, observation and operation: •     Understood the changes made in the IT environment during  the year and ascertained its effect on the financial statements  controls and accounts. •     Tested key controls operating over the information technology  in relation to financial accounting and reporting systems,  including system access and system change management,  program development and computer operations. User access controls operation: •     Obtained management’s evaluation of the access rights granted  to applications relevant to financial accounting and reporting  systems and tested resolution of a sample of expectations. •     Further, we assessed the operating effectiveness of controls  over granting, removal and appropriateness of access rights. Application controls: •     We tested the design and operating effectiveness of automated  controls critical to financial accounting and reporting. •     For any identified deficiencies, tested the design and operating  effectiveness of compensating controls and, where necessary,  extended the scope of our substantive audit procedures. •     Our tests also included testing of the compensating controls  or alternate procedures to assess whether there were any  unaddressed IT risks that would materially impact the Financial  Statements. •     Considered the reports for certain applications on test check  basis, as issued by the professional consultants with respect to  VAPT testing done on such applications. •     Considered the reports issued by the professional consultants  with respect to Information Systems (IS) Audit and IT  Infrastructure of the Company and of certain applications at  group level relevant for the Company.

The Other Information comprises the  information included in the Annual Report but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and our Auditors’  Report thereon. The Other Information is expected to be made available to us after the date of this Auditors’ Report. 6.   Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any  form of assurance conclusion thereon. 7.   In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears  to be materially misstated. 

Consolidated financial statements 435 8.   When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required  to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the  relevant laws and regulations. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements 9.   The Bank’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these  Consolidated Financial Statements in term of the requirements of the Act, that give a true and fair view of the  Consolidated State of Affairs, Consolidated Profit and Consolidated Cash Flows of the Group in accordance with  the Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2021, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and provisions of section 29 of the Banking  Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars and guidelines issued by the RBI from time to time (‘RBI Guidelines’). The respective  Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate are responsible for maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding  of the assets of the Group of its associates and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection  of the appropriate accounting software for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those  related to retention of audit logs; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and  estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,  relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view  and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error which have been used for the purpose of  preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Management and directors of the Bank, as aforesaid. 10.   In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Management and the Board of Directors of the  companies included in the Group and of its associate are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern  basis of accounting unless the Management and the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 11.   The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate are responsible for  overseeing the financial reporting process of the respective companies included in the Group and associate. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 12.   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of  users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 13.   As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also:   13.1.   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to  fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.   13.2.   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial  Statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls.   13.3.   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by the Management. 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 436   13.4.   Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on  the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures  in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Group and its associate to cease to continue as a going concern.   13.5.   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including  the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.   13.6.   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business  activities within the Group and its associate to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of  such entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For  the other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors,  such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out  by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 14.   We communicate with those charged with governance of the Bank regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we  identify during our audit. 15.   We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 16.   From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit  matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of  such communication.

We did not audit the Financial Statements of nine subsidiaries and two stepdown subsidiaries, whose financial statements  reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of  ` 53,118.53 crore as at 31 March 2025, total revenues (before  consolidation adjustments) of  ` 8,503.40 crore, total net profit after tax (before consolidation adjustments) of  ` 1,768.24  crore and net cash inflows (before consolidation adjustments) amounting to  ` 359.39 crore for the year ended on that  date, as considered in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated financial statements 441 Meaning of Internal Financial controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements 7.   A company’s internal financial controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls  with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that   (1)   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company;   (2)   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the  company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and   (3)   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or  disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements 8.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or  fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference  to the Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with  reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the  degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Other Matters 9.   Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal  financial controls system with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements in so far as it relates to Nine subsidiaries  and One Stepdown Subsidiary, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the  auditors of such subsidiaries incorporated in India.

Basis of preparation   a)   The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention  on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India  (‘GAAP’), unless otherwise stated by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’), to comply with the statutory requirements  prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the circulars, notifications, guidelines  and directives issued by the RBI from time to time and the Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the  Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2021 to the extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in  India.

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 454   d)   The audited financial statements of the above subsidiaries/step-down subsidiaries have been drawn up to the  same reporting date as that of the Bank, i.e. 31 March, 2025.   e)   The financial statements of the Bank’s foreign subsidiary, Axis U.K. Limited (‘the Company’) are prepared in  accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards which have been converted to Indian GAAP for  the purpose of consolidated financial statements of the Group.   Considering that the Company is currently under  liquidation, the financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a basis other than that of a going  concern. Basis the size and scale of operations of the Company, the impact of the above is not material on the  financial statements/position of the Group.   f)   The Group’s share of net profit after tax for the year ended 31 March, 2025 as included in the consolidated  financial statements in respect of the Associate entity is based on management’s best estimate in the absence  of financial information of such Associate. 3.   Use of estimates   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting  principles requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) at the date of the financial statements, revenues and expenses during  the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Management believes that the estimates  and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Any revisions, as and  when carried out, to the accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the current and future periods. 4.   Changes in accounting policies-   Effective 1 April, 2024, the Bank has carried out the following changes in its accounting policies:   Classification and Valuation of Investments   Effective 1 April, 2024 the Bank has adopted the revised framework as detailed in RBI Master Direction on Classification,  Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio issued on 12 September, 2023 (‘RBI Investment Direction 2023’).  Accordingly, as prescribed under the transition provisions of the aforesaid framework the Bank has (1) transferred the  balance in Investment Reserve Account as at 31 March, 2024 of  ` 242.29 crores to the general reserve (2) transferred  an amount of  ` 1,217.86 crores (net of tax) to the general reserve, resulting into increase in the net worth of the Bank,  on account of reversal of balance in provision for depreciation on investments as at 31 March, 2024 and adjustment for  the difference between the carrying value of its investment portfolio as per the revised framework and the previous  carrying value as at 31 March, 2024.   Further, in compliance with the said RBI Investment Direction 2023, the valuation gains and losses at the period ended  31 March, 2025, across all performing investments held under Available for Sale (AFS) category are aggregated and the  net appreciation amounting to  ` 110.39 crores (net of tax) has been directly recognised in AFS Reserve. The securities  held in Fair Value through Profit and Loss (‘FVTPL’) category are fair valued at the period ended 31 March, 2025 and  the net gain of  ` 700.51 crores for the year ended 31 March, 2025, arising on such valuation has been recognised in  the Profit and Loss Account. Figures for the previous year are not comparable to that extent. 5.   Significant accounting policies 5.1    Investments   Axis Bank Ltd.   Significant accounting policies for investments appl icable for FY25   Classification   In accordance with the RBI Investment Direction, 2023, investments (except investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures  and associates) are classified at the time of acquisition as: 

Consolidated financial statements 455   •   Held to Maturity (‘HTM’);   •   Available for Sale (‘AFS’) and   •   Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) with Held for Trading (HFT) as a separate investment  subcategory within FVTPL.   Classification of Investments in the Balance sheet   For disclosure in the Balance Sheet, investments in India are classified under six categories - Government Securities,  Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investment in Subsidiaries/Joint Ventures/Associates and  Others. Investments made outside India are classified under three categories - Government Securities, Subsidiaries  and/or Joint Ventures abroad and Others.   All investments are accounted for on settlement date, except investments in equity shares which are accounted  for on trade date.   i.   Held to Maturity (‘HTM’)     The Bank classifies investments as HTM, if both of the following conditions are met:     •   The investment is acquired with the intention and objective of holding it to maturity, i.e., the financial  assets are held with an objective to collect the contractual cash flows; and     •   The contractual terms of the investment give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest on principal outstanding (‘SPPI criterion’) on specified dates.   ii.   Available for Sale (‘AFS’)     The Bank classifies investments as AFS, if both the following conditions are met:     •     The investment is acquired with an objective which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows  and selling securities; and     •   The contractual terms of the investment give rise to cash flows that meet SPPI criterion on specified dates.     The Bank, upon initial recognition, may make an irrevocable election to classify an equity instrument as an AFS  that is not held with the objective of trading.   iii.   Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)     The investments that are not classified as HTM or AFS are classified as FVTPL. The Bank classifies investments in  FVTPL category as either FVTPL-Held for Trading (‘HFT’) or FVTPL Non-HFT. Any investment held by the Bank  for one or more of the following purposes is, when it is first recognised on its books, designated as a FVTPL HFT:    •   short-term  resale;     •   profiting from short-term price movements;     •   locking in arbitrage profits; or     •   hedging risks that arise from instruments meeting all of the above     Investments in listed equities, trading-related repo-style transactions, instruments resulting from market-making  activities, equity investments in a fund are included in FVTPL HFT category.

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 456   Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures   All investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures held by Bank are classified under this category separately  from the aforesaid investment categories.   Initial recognition   The Bank measures all investments at fair value on initial recognition. Unless facts and circumstances suggest that the  fair value is materially different from the acquisition cost, it is presumed that the acquisition cost is the fair value.   i.   Acquisition cost     Costs incurred at the time of acquisition, pertaining to investments, such as brokerage, commission etc. are  charged to the Profit and Loss Account. Broken period interest is charged to the Profit and Loss Account. Cost  of investments is computed based on the weighted average cost method.   ii.   Day 1 gain/loss     Day 1 Gain/loss is the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and acquisition cost.     Any Day 1 gain/loss arising on quoted investments is recognized in the Profit and Loss Account. Any Day 1 loss  arising from Level 3 investments is recognised immediately. Any Day 1 gains arising from Level 3 investments is  deferred. In the case of debt instruments, the Day 1 gain is amortized on a straight-line basis up to the maturity  date (or earliest call date for perpetual instruments), while for unquoted equity instruments, the gain is set aside  as a liability until the security is listed or derecognised.   iii.   Subsequent measurement     a.   Investments classified under the HTM category         Investments held in HTM category are carried at cost and are not Mark-to-Market (‘MTM’) after initial  recognition. Any discount or premium on the investments under HTM category is amortised over the  remaining life of the instrument. The amortised amount is reflected under item II ‘Income on Investments’  of Schedule 13: ‘Interest Earned’ with a contra in Schedule 8: ‘Investments’.         Realised gains on sale of investments in HTM category are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and  subsequently appropriated to the Capital Reserve Account (net of taxes and transfer to statutory reserves)  in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Realised losses are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.     b.   Investments classified under AFS category         Investments held in AFS category are fair valued. Any discount or premium on the acquisition of debt  securities under AFS is amortised over the remaining life of the instrument. The amortised amount is  reflected in the financial statements under item II ‘Income on Investments’ of Schedule 13: ‘Interest  Earned’ with a contra in Schedule 8: ‘Investments’.         The net valuation gains and losses across all performing investments under AFS is aggregated and the net  appreciation or depreciation (net of tax) is directly credited or debited to the AFS Reserve without routing  through the Profit & Loss Account.         The AFS-Reserve is reckoned as Common Equity Tier (CET) 1 capital but not available for distribution of  dividend and coupon on Additional Tier I instruments         On sale or maturity of a debt instrument in AFS category, the accumulated gain/ loss for that security in  the AFS Reserve is transferred from the AFS Reserve and recognized in the Profit and Loss Account.         In the case of equity instruments designated under AFS at the time of initial recognition, any gain or loss  on sale of such investments is transferred from AFS Reserve to Capital Reserve in accordance with the RBI  Investment Direction, 2023. 

Consolidated financial statements 457     c.

The amortised amount is reflected in the financial statements under item II ‘Income on  Investments’ of Schedule 13: ‘Interest Earned’ with a contra in Schedule 8: ‘Investments’.     d.   Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures         The Bank measures all the investments (i.e., including debt and equity) in subsidiaries, associates and joint  ventures at acquisition cost.         Any discount or premium on the acquisition of debt securities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures  is amortised over the remaining life of the instrument. The amortised amount is reflected in the financial  statements under item II ‘Income on Investments’ of Schedule 13: ‘Interest Earned’.   Valuation   The Bank determines the fair values of its investments according to the following hierarchy:   Level 1:  Valuation based on quoted market price: These investments are valued with quoted prices (unadjusted) for  identical instruments in active markets that the Bank can access at the measurement date.   Level 2:  Valuation based on using observable inputs: These investments are valued with inputs other than quoted  prices included within Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly.   Level 3:  Valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: These investments are valued using valuation  techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.   The fair value of various types of instruments is determined as per the valuation norms laid down in RBI Investment  Direction 2023, as follows:   •   The fair value of quoted investments (other than discounted instruments) included in the AFS and FVTPL  categories is considered as available from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges or prices, yield and spread  matrix declared by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (‘FIMMDA’)/Financial  Benchmark India Private Limited (‘FBIL’), periodically.   •   Treasury Bills, Exchange Funded Bills, Commercial Paper and Certificate of Deposits being discounted  instruments, are valued at carrying cost which includes discount accreted over the period to maturity.   •   Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest repurchase price/Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) declared by  the mutual fund.   •   Units of Venture Capital Funds (‘VCF’) and Unquoted Alternative Investment Fund (AIFs) are valued at Net Asset  Value (NAV) declared by the funds. Where an AIF fails to carry out and disclose the valuation of its investments  by an independent valuer as per the frequency mandated by SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund) Regulations,  2012 the value of its units is treated as Re. 1. In case AIF is not registered under SEBI (Alternative Investment  Fund) Regulations, 2012 and the latest disclosed valuation of its investments by an independent valuer precedes  the date of valuation by more than 18 months, the value of its units is treated as Re. 1.   •   Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures category are assessed for impairment to determine  permanent diminution, if any, in accordance with the RBI guidelines and suitable provisions are made.   •   The fair value of investments where current quotations are not available, is determined in accordance with the  norms prescribed by the RBI/FIMMDA/FBIL as under: 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 458     a)   The fair value of unquoted government securities which are in the nature of Statutory Liquidity Ratio  (‘SLR’) securities forming part of AFS, FVTPL-HFT and FVTPL Non-HFT categories are computed as per  the rates published by FIMMDA/FBIL.     b)   In case of special bonds issued by the Government of India that do not qualify for SLR purposes, unquoted  bonds, debentures and preference shares where interest/dividend is received regularly (i.e. not overdue  beyond 90 days), the market price is derived based on the Yield to maturity (‘YTM’) for such securities as  published by FIMMDA/FBIL and suitably marked up for credit risk applicable to the credit rating of the  instrument. The matrix for credit risk mark-up for each category and credit ratings along with residual  maturity issued by FIMMDA/FBIL is adopted for this purpose.     c)   In case of bonds & debentures where interest is not received regularly (i.e. overdue beyond 90 days), the  valuation is in accordance with prudential norms for provisioning as prescribed by the RBI.     d)   Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) are valued as per extant RBI/FIMMDA guidelines.     e)   Equity shares, for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not quoted on the  stock exchanges, are valued at break-up value (without considering revaluation reserves, if any) which is  ascertained from the company’s latest Balance Sheet (not older than 18 months). In case the latest Balance  Sheet is not available, the shares are valued at Re. 1 per company.     f)   Valuation of investments in private equity funds and limited liability partnership funds is based on valuation  of their underlying exposures.     g)   Investments in listed instruments of Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’)/Infrastructure Investment Trust  (‘INVIT’) are valued at the closing price on the recognised stock exchange. In case the instruments are not  traded on any stock exchange, valuation is carried out based on the latest NAV (not older than 1 year)  submitted by the trust.     h)   Investments in Government guaranteed Security Receipts (‘SRs’) are valued periodically by reckoning the  Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset Reconstruction Company (‘ARC’) based on the recovery  ratings received for such instruments. Any Government guaranteed SRs outstanding after the final  settlement of the Government guarantee or the expiry of the guarantee period, whichever is earlier, are  valued at one rupee ( ` 1).       Investments in other SRs are valued as per the NAV declared by the issuing ARC or net book value of loans  transferred or estimated recoverable value based on Bank’s internal assessment on case to case basis,  whichever is lower. Investments in such Security Receipts where original maturity period has expired are  valued at one rupee ( ` 1). In case of investments in SRs which are backed by more than 10 percent of the  stressed assets sold by the Bank, the valuation of such SRs is additionally subject to a floor of face value of  the SRs reduced by the provisioning rate as per the extant asset classification and provisioning norms as  applicable to the underlying loans, assuming that the loan notionally continued in the books of the Bank.   Investment asset classification and provisioning   Investments under HTM, AFS and FVTPL category are subjected to income recognition, asset classification and  provisioning norms of RBI. Non-performing Investments (NPIs) are identified and provision is made thereon in the  Profit and Loss account, as per the RBI guidelines.

A NPI investment is segregated from other  investments within the same category [i.e., HTM, AFS, or FVTPL] under which it was classified at initial recognition.  Interest on NPIs is not recognized in the Profit and Loss Account until received. MTM appreciation in case of NPIs over  and above the book value is not recognized and ignored.   Reclassification between categories   Reclassification of investments between categories (viz. HTM, AFS and FVTPL) if any is carried out only after, prior  approval of Board of Directors and RBI and the same is accounted for in accordance with the RBI guidelines.

Outstanding forward exchange contracts including tom/spot contracts (excluding swaps undertaken to hedge foreign  currency assets/liabilities and funding swaps) as at Balance Sheet date are revalued at closing spot and forward rates  as applicable as notified by FEDAI/FBIL and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities.

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 466 considered on present value basis by discounting the forward value till cash date using Alternative Reference Rate  (‘ARR’) curve and converting the foreign currency amount using the respective spot rates as notified by FEDAI/FBIL.  The resulting gains or losses on revaluation are included in the Profit and Loss Account.   Currency futures contracts are mark-to-market using the daily settlement price on a trading day, which is the closing  price of the respective futures contracts on that day. While the daily settlement price is computed based on the last  half an hour weighted average price of such contracts, the final settlement price is taken as the RBI reference rate on  the last trading day of the futures contracts or as may be specified by the relevant authority from time to time. All  open positions are marked-to-market based on the settlement price and the resultant MTM profit/loss is daily settled  with the exchange.   Valuation of Exchange Traded Currency Options (‘ETCO’) is carried out using internal pricing models and valuation  of Interest Rate Futures (‘IRF’) is carried out on the basis of the daily settlement price of each contract provided  by the exchange.

Hedging derivatives including funding swaps   Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading (including funding swaps that are entered into to establish  the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction), and are outstanding at  the Balance Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate.   The premium or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line  basis as expense or income over the life of the contract.   For hedge transactions through other derivatives, the Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception  of transaction itself. The effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter.  In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognized  in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of hedging instrument for  the effective portion is recognised in Schedule 2- ‘Reserves and Surplus’ under ‘Cash Flow Hedge Reserve’ and the  ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The  accumulated balance in the Cash Flow Hedge Reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit  and Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.   Provisioning   Pursuant to the RBI guidelines any receivables under derivative contracts comprising of crystallised receivables as  well as positive MTM in respect of future receivables which remain overdue for more than 90 days are reversed  through the Profit and Loss account and are held in a separate suspense account under Schedule 5 – ‘Other Liabilities  and Provisions’.   Axis Finance Limited   The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk of firm commitments and highly  probable forecast transactions. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are  entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting  gain or loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and  effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Profit and Loss Account depends  on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item.   Cash Flow Hedges   A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk  associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or a firm commitment in  respect of foreign currency and (ii) could affect the statement of profit and loss. Under a cash flow hedge, the hedging  

Consolidated financial statements 467 instrument is measured at fair value, but any gain or loss that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized  in equity, e.g., cash flow hedge reserve. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is  recognized immediately in the Profit and Loss Account.   Fair Value Hedges   A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised  firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a  particular risk and could affect the statement of profit and loss. When applying fair value hedge accounting, the  hedging instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss.  The hedged item is remeasured to fair value in respect of the hedged risk even if normally it is measured at cost, e.g.,  a fixed rate borrowing. Any resulting adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item related to the hedged risk  is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account even if normally such a change may not be recognised, e.g., for inventory  being hedged for fair value changes. The fair value changes of the hedged item and the hedging instrument will offset  and result in no net impact in the Profit and Loss Account except for the impact of ineffectiveness. 5.9   Revenue recognition   Axis Bank Ltd.

These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.   A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:   •   a possible obligation arising from a past event, the existence of which will be confirmed by occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not within the control of the Group; or   •   a present obligation arising from a past event which is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow  of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation  cannot be made.   When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is  remote, no provision or disclosure is made contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However,  contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the  asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs. 5.23   Accounting for dividend   Group   As per AS-4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance Sheet date’ as notified by the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, the Group does not account for proposed dividend  as a liability through appropriation from the Profit and Loss Account. The same is recognised in the year of actual  payout post approval of the shareholders. However, the Bank considers proposed dividend in determining capital  funds in computing the capital adequacy ratio as on the reporting date. 5.24   Cash and cash equivalents   Group   Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, rupee digital currency, balances with RBI, balances with other banks  and money at call and short notice. 5.25   Segment Reporting   Group   The disclosure relating to segment information is made in accordance with AS-17: ‘Segment Reporting’ and relevant  guidelines issued by the RBI.

Fair Value Methodology   In line with RBI clarification on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/Chief Executive Officers/ Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff issued on 30 August, 2021, the Bank follows the fair value method  for all share-linked instruments granted after 31 March, 2021 and consequently recognizes the fair value of options  computed using the Black-Scholes model, without reducing estimated forfeitures, as a compensation expense over the  vesting period. During the year, the Group recognised compensation cost of  ` 430.53 crores (Previous year  ` 519.57  crores) for options/units granted to employees of the Group. 

Consolidated financial statements 479   The fair value of the options/units is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes options pricing model,  with the following assumptions:  31 March, 2025  31 March, 2024 ESOP ESU ESOP ESU Dividend yield 0.09% 0.09% 0.26% 0.26% Expected life 2.95-5.95 years 1-3 years 2.95-5.95 years 1-3 years Risk free interest rate 6.85% to 7.09% 6.95% to 7.06% 6.79% to 7.17% 6.94% to 7.12% Volatility 24.00% to 29.15% 19.89% to 24.01% 29.90% to 38.27% 25.28% to 31.99%   Volatility is the measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period.  The measure of volatility used in the Black-Scholes options pricing model is the annualised standard deviation of  the continuously compounded rates of return on the stock over a period of time. For calculating volatility, the daily  volatility of the stock prices on the National Stock Exchange, over a period prior to the date of grant, corresponding  with the expected life of the options has been considered.   The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 March, 2025 is  ` 358.68  (previous year  ` 297.95).   The weighted average fair value of units granted during the year ended 31 March, 2025 is  ` 1,059.51 (previous  year:  ` 842.45). 1.6   Proposed Dividend   The Board of Directors, in their meeting held on 24 April, 2025 have proposed a final dividend of  ` 1 per equity share  amounting to  ` 309.74 crores. The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.  In terms of revised Accounting Standard (AS) 4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance sheet date’  as notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, such  proposed dividend has not been recognised as a liability as on 31 March, 2025.   During the year, the Bank paid final dividend of  ` 1 per equity share amounting  ` 309.09 crores pertaining to the  previous year ended 31 March, 2024. 1.7   Segmental reporting   The business of the Group is divided into four segments: Treasury, Retail Banking, Corporate/Wholesale Banking and  Other Banking Business.

Revenues of the Treasury segment primarily consist of fees and gains or losses from trading operations and interest  income on the investment portfolio. The principal expenses of the segment consist of interest expense on funds  borrowed from external sources and other internal segments, premises expenses, personnel costs, other direct  overheads and allocated expenses.   Revenues of the Corporate/Wholesale Banking segment consist of interest and fees earned on loans given to  customers falling under this segment and fees arising from transaction services and merchant banking activities such  as syndication and debenture trusteeship.

These also include demands raised by tax authorities and other statutory authorities which  are disputed by the Group. The Group holds provision of  ` 904.76 crores as on 31 March, 2025 (previous year  ` 372.60 crores) towards claims assessed as probable. 

Financial statements Integrated Annual Report  2024-25 498   b)   Liability for partly paid investments     This represents amounts remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.   c)   Liability on account of forward exchange contracts     The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, including non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts on its  own account and on OTC for customers. Forward exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign  currency at a future date at the contracted rate. A non-deliverable forward contract is a currency derivatives  contract to exchange cash flows between the contracted forward exchange rate and prevailing spot rates.  The amount of contingent liability represents the notional principal of respective forward exchange contracts.  With respect to the transactions entered into with its customers, the Bank generally enters into off-setting  transactions in the inter-bank market. This results in generation of a higher number of outstanding transactions,  and hence a large value of gross notional principal of the portfolio, while the net market risk is lower.   d)   Liability on account of derivative contracts     The Group enters into derivative contracts in the form of currency options/swaps, exchange traded currency  options, non-deliverable derivatives and interest rate/ currency futures on its own account and on OTC for  customers. Currency swaps are commitments between two counterparties to exchange streams of interest  payments and/or principal amounts in different currencies on specified dates over the duration of the swap at a  pre-agreed exchange rate. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash  flows. Interest rate futures are standardised, exchange-traded contracts that represent a pledge to undertake a  certain interest rate transaction at a specified price, on a specified future date. Forward rate agreements (FRA)  are financial contracts between two counterparties, in which a buyer will pay or receive, on the settlement  date, the difference between a pre-determined fixed rate (FRA rate) and a reference interest rate, applied on a  notional principal amount, for a specified forward period. A foreign currency option is an agreement between  two parties in which one grants to the other the right to buy or sell a specified amount of currency at a specific  price within a specified time period or at a specified future time. An Exchange Traded Currency Option contract  is a standardised foreign exchange derivative contract, which gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation,  to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a  specified date on the date of expiry. A non-deliverable option contract is a currency derivatives contract that  offers the right, but not the obligation to either purchase or sell a currency against another currency and the  contract is settled at the difference between the contracted exchange rate and prevailing spot rate on the expiry  date. Currency Futures contract is a standardised, exchange-traded contract, to buy or sell a certain underlying  currency at a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The amount of contingent liability represents the  notional principal of respective derivative contracts. With respect to the transactions entered into with its  customers, the Bank generally enters into off-setting transactions in the inter-bank market. This results in  generation of a higher number of outstanding transactions, and hence a large value of gross notional principal of  the portfolio, while the net market risk is lower.   e)   Guarantees given on behalf of constituents     As a part of its banking activities, the Bank issues guarantees on behalf of its customers to enhance their credit  standing. Guarantees represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of the  customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations. These are stated net of cash margin held with  the Bank as on the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.   f)   Acceptances, endorsements and other obligations     These include documentary credit issued by the Bank on behalf of its customers and bills drawn by the Bank’s  customers that are accepted or endorsed by the Bank. These are stated net of cash margin held with the Bank  as on the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet. 

Consolidated financial statements 499   g)   Other items for which the Group is contingently liable     Other items represent outstanding amount of bills rediscounted by the Bank, estimated amount of contracts  remaining to be executed on capital account, notional principal on account of outstanding Tom/ Spot foreign  exchange contracts, contracts for purchase of investments where settlement is due post balance sheet date, deed  of indemnity issued to liquidator of overseas subsidiary, contingent liability relating to undertakings issued towards  settlements under resolution plan in respect of non-performing assets, commitments towards underwriting and  investment in equity through bids under Initial Public Offering (IPO) of corporates, commitment for investment  in Associate entity and the amount transferred to Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF).   The Group has a process whereby periodically all long term contracts (including derivative contracts) are assessed for  material foreseeable losses. At the year end, the Group has reviewed and recorded adequate provision as required  under any law/accounting standards for material foreseeable losses on such long term contracts (including derivative  contracts) in the books of account and disclosed the same under the relevant notes in the financial statements,  where applicable. 2.
