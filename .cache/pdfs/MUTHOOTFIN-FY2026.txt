Annual Report 2024-25 Golden Milestones 

Golden Milestones FY 2024-25 was a landmark year for Muthoot Finance, defined  by strong performance, meaningful progress, and purpose-led  transformation. It was a year of Golden Milestones, as we  strengthened our leadership in gold loans, advanced digital  innovation, expanded our social footprint, and reaffirmed our  commitment to inclusive and responsible growth. Amid a supportive macroeconomic backdrop and evolving gold loan  dynamics, we delivered our highest-ever consolidated results. Loan assets  under management (AUM) rose to ₹1.22 trillion, while profit after tax stood  at ₹53.52 billion. On a standalone basis, AUM crossed ₹1.08 trillion, with  nearly 1.8 million new gold loan customers onboarded. We launched new Gold Loan products, offering 24/7 access to credit, and  expanded our network to 4855 branches, deepening our rural and semi-urban  presence. Our digital journey gathered pace through enhancements to the  iMuthoot app, API integrations, and AI-powered systems, strengthening  customer experience and operational agility. Our subsidiaries contributed 13% to Group AUM and 4% to PAT, underscoring  the strength of our diversified financial services platform. Beyond financial performance, we deepened our social impact. A CSR  expenditure of ₹1.03 billion supported initiatives in education, healthcare,  and sustainability. Industry recognitions − Great Place to Work and  the FICCI Women Empowerment Award reinforced our commitment  to people and purpose. As we look forward to the next year, these milestones lay the  groundwork for continued sustainable growth, rooted in trust,  innovation, and long-term stakeholder value. 

Our guiding  inspiration  Our founder, Late Shri M. George Muthoot, envisioned  the prospects of gold loans in India long back in 1939.   His business insight and vision helped transform  India’s gold loan business. Guided by his values, we  have strengthened our reputation over the years and  established ourselves as a trusted pan-India brand. Our visionary Chairman, Late Shri M. G. George  Muthoot, was instrumental in making Muthoot Finance  a Pan-India Company and the largest gold loan NBFC in  India. Under his strategic leadership, the Muthoot Group  grew into a multidimensional business behemoth from  31 branches in 4 states in 1979 to 4,600+ branches across  the country by 2021.

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE A golden chapter  of milestones Dear Shareholders, It gives me immense pride to present  the Annual Report for FY 2024-25.  This year tested the resilience of global  economies and institutions yet stood  as a testament to the strength of India’s  growth story and the critical role of  Non-Banking Financial Companies like  Muthoot Finance in furthering it. At Muthoot Finance, our journey  has always been rooted in trust,  responsibility and unwavering purpose.  Over the decades, we have built a  model of inclusive finance — not  just delivering credit but enabling  livelihoods, aspirations and resilience.  This year, as economic and credit cycles  evolved, our long-held conviction in the  value of secured, accessible, and ethical  finance proved stronger than ever. FY 2024-25 marked a significant  milestone in your Company’s journey.  Amidst a challenging and uncertain  environment, Muthoot Finance  delivered a remarkable performance  across both financial and non-financial  parameters. This achievement reflects  not only our operational excellence but  also the strength of our purpose. Such resilience is rooted in the solid  foundation laid over eight decades  ago, a legacy built on trust, integrity  and responsibility. Today, that legacy  continues to guide us as we grow with  purpose and discipline. By balancing  progress with prudence, we are  building a future-ready institution,  one that remains a steadfast financial  partner in Bharat’s rise in the global  economic landscape.  India’s economic resilience:   A foundation for confidence Despite global volatility and tightening  financial conditions, India stood  out as the fastest-growing major  economy, with a GDP growth rate  of 6.5%. The macro narrative was  driven by robust domestic demand,  particularly in rural India, strong  services output, a record $825 billion  in exports, and continued momentum  in infrastructure investments. Private consumption rose by 7.3%,  contributing its highest share to GDP  in over two decades. This growth was  not just statistical; it reflected rising  aspirations, deeper formalisation, and  expanding economic participation  across socio-economic strata. For a  financial institution like ours, operating  at the intersection of tradition and  transformation, this evolving landscape  presented both immense opportunity  and responsibility. NBFCs: Catalysts of last-mile  credit Amidst this vibrant economic milieu,  NBFCs emerged as resilient and agile  drivers of credit expansion. With net  advances growing at a healthy 20%  y-o-y to ₹24.5 trillion and total loan  AUM touching ₹28.2 trillion, NBFCs  significantly outpaced the banking  sector’s credit growth of ~12%. More than just growth, this  performance reaffirmed NBFCs’ role  as indispensable enablers of last-mile  credit. Even as overall credit growth  moderated to ~13–15% due to high  base effects and regulatory tightening,  NBFCs maintained momentum,  especially in retail and secured lending. Yet, the year was not without its  complexities. Emerging stress in  unsecured segments like microfinance  and personal loans, with stressed  microfinance assets climbing to 5.9%  by March 2025, called for sharper  risk calibration and operational  discipline. Within this context, secured  lending and gold loans in particular  stood out for their stability and  strategic relevance. Gold loans: A resilient and  expanding asset class FY 2024-25 will be remembered as a  defining year for the Indian gold loan  industry, as gold loans emerged as the  fastest-growing credit category. This surge was underpinned by: •   A sharp increase in gold prices  (over 30% YoY), raising collateral  value and enabling wider visibility  as a borrowing option for the  common man. •   A natural shift from unsecured to  secured credit amid regulatory   tightening. •   Behavioural shifts that redefined  gold — from a cultural store of value  to a dynamic financial asset. For households in semi-urban and rural  India, gold loans offered timely liquidity,  financial dignity, and security. For  lenders, the high collateralisation and  short tenures translated into prudent  risk profiles.  At Muthoot Finance,  our journey has always  been rooted in trust,  responsibility and  unwavering purpose.  Over the decades, we  have built a model  of inclusive finance  — not just delivering  credit but enabling  livelihoods, aspirations  and resilience.“ George Jacob Muthoot Chairman & Whole-time Director Despite global  volatility and  tightening financial  conditions, India  stood out as the  fastest-growing  major economy,  with a GDP growth  rate of 6.5%.“ Chairman’s message  / Corporate overview 10 11 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Committed to inclusive and  sustainable growth Even as we expand and digitise, we  remain deeply committed to social  equity. Our community initiatives,  guided by the IRECS framework:  Inclusiveness, Relevance, Efficiency,  Collaboration, and Sustainability,   reached over countless beneficiaries this  year, spanning healthcare, education,  environmental sustainability, and  rural empowerment. From scholarships worth ₹13.40  million under the Muthoot M George  Excellence Awards to clean water  initiatives, diabetic care centres, and  housing projects under Muthoot  Aashiyana, our CSR efforts reflected  our role not just as a financier but as a  societal partner. We also responded to national  imperatives, distributing school kits,  promoting solar energy, and providing  disaster relief where needed, proving  that responsible business can be a  powerful force for development. People power: Building  capability and culture At the heart of our achievements are  the people who make them possible.  This year, we invested in building  a future-ready workforce through  digital hiring platforms, leadership  development, succession planning, and  the Pathshala internship programme.  As a pioneer in the segment, Muthoot  Finance welcomed this transformation.  It reaffirmed the essential, future-ready  nature of our gold loan franchise,  built on deep customer relationships,  ethical governance, and expansive  last-mile access. Unlocking structural growth  amidst funding tightness Even as the gold loan market surged,  the sector faced funding constraints.  Despite their strong credit performance,  bank lending to NBFCs grew only  limited, indicating cautious liquidity  flows. This dichotomy underscores the  need for diversified funding models and  greater institutional recognition of the  gold loan asset class. FY 2024-25 will be  remembered as a  defining year for  the Indian gold  loan industry. Gold  loans emerged as  the fastest-growing  credit category.” Interestingly, even banks deepened  their exposure to gold loans, with  outstanding bank gold loans more  than doubling during the year. This  shift illustrates gold-backed lending’s  systemic relevance and underscores the  need for regulatory clarity and capital  efficiency norms that align with its  risk-adjusted strength. Under Project Pragati, we reimagined  our HR frameworks, digitised core  functions, and fostered a culture of  merit and mobility. Our recognition  as a Great Place to Work (fourth year  running) and FICCI’s award for women’s  empowerment are affirmations of our  employee-first, inclusive ethos. At Muthoot Finance, we remained  confident in this opportunity, not just  as a product of the moment, but as a  structurally resilient, counter-cyclical  financial solution. Driving synergies through  diversified growth While gold loans form our core, our  broader financial services ecosystem  continues to mature, offering customers  integrated solutions and adding  strategic depth to our portfolio. •   Belstar Microfinance Limited  recalibrated its operations in  response to industry headwinds,  maintained credit discipline, and laid  the groundwork for secured lending  through gold-backed microcredit. •   Muthoot Homefin (India) Limited  expanded access to affordable  housing finance in Tier II and III  towns, supporting economically  weaker and low-income groups  with responsible housing credit. •   Muthoot Insurance Brokers  continued to scale its health and life  segments, ensuring protection-led  financial inclusion. •   Muthoot Money Ltd. transitioned  its operations from vehicle finance  to a pure play Gold Loan NBFC  strengthened its footprint across  21 states and 5 UTs. •   Asia Asset Finance PLC, our listed  Sri Lankan arm, furthered our  regional diversification, offering  gold, SME, and leasing products  across 100 branches. Together, our subsidiaries contributed  13% to our consolidated AUM and  4% to PAT — a clear testament to the  health, relevance, and sustainability of  our diversified business architecture. Looking ahead As we look ahead to FY 2025- 26, we are conscious of both the  opportunities and responsibilities that  lie before us. The gold loan market  continues to expand, offering both  counter-cyclical strength and social  relevance. Our diversified model is well  placed to manage risk and create value.  Our digital foundation enables scale  with speed. And our purpose to provide  safe, ethical, and accessible finance  remains our North Star. In a rapidly evolving environment, what  sets us apart is not just what we do,  but why we do it. At Muthoot Finance,  we remain guided by a vision of shared  prosperity, one that includes every  household we serve, every community  we uplift, and every stakeholder we  work with. On behalf of the Board of Directors,  I extend sincere gratitude to our  customers, employees, investors,  regulators, and partners for your  continued trust. Let us step forward  together — responsibly, inclusively,  and with conviction. Warm regards, George Jacob Muthoot Chairman & Whole-time Director Building smarter systems for  seamless service FY 2024-25 was also a landmark year  in our digital journey. Our investments  in cloud-native architecture, API-first  systems, and AI-driven decision-making  enabled us to scale more efficiently,  respond to customers faster, and  enhance service quality across channels. Our upgraded iMuthoot app,  doorstep-enabled Loan@Home  platform, and products offering  dynamic limits, 24/7 access, and  interest-on-utilisation exemplify this  shift. Together, they place financial  control directly in the hands of our  customers, offering convenience  without compromise. As we transition into a hybrid model  of phygital engagement, we continue  to blend our legacy of personal trust  with the speed and scalability of  digital innovation. Our upgraded  iMuthoot app,  doorstep-enabled  Loan@Home  platform, and  products offering  dynamic limits,  24/7 access, and  interest-on-utilisation  exemplify this shift.“ From scholarships  worth ₹13.4 million  and the Muthoot M  George Excellence  Awards to clean  water initiatives,  diabetic care centres,  and housing projects  under Muthoot  Aashiyana, our CSR  efforts reflected  our role not just as  a financier but as a  societal partner.“ Chairman’s message  / Corporate overview 12 13 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Throughout the  year, we remained  focused on responsible  growth and inclusive  service delivery. From  expanding in rural  and semi-urban India  to launching smarter  gold-backed solutions  and refining our digital  ecosystem, every  initiative was guided  by our commitment  to create long-term  stakeholder value.“ George Alexander Muthoot Managing Director MANAGING DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE Staying the course  Strengthening the future Dear Shareholders, As we close FY 2024-25, I take great  pride in presenting Muthoot Finance  Limited’s Annual Report, a year  marked by steady progress, strategic  evolution, and the enduring trust of  our stakeholders. Throughout the year, we remained  focused on responsible growth  and inclusive service delivery. From  expanding in rural and semi-urban  India to launching smarter gold-backed  solutions and refining our digital  ecosystem, every initiative was guided  by our commitment to create long-term  stakeholder value. India’s economy continues to offer a  strong foundation, with projected GDP  growth of 6.4% in FY 2025-26, driven  by infrastructure reforms, formalisation,  and inclusive programmes, boosting  consumption and credit demand  across regions. Within this context, NBFCs are playing  a critical role by bridging credit access  gaps for underserved communities.  With sector credit expected to grow  at a CAGR of 15–17% between  FY 2024-25 and FY 2026-27, NBFCs are  well-placed to support entrepreneurship  and financial inclusion. Recent RBI measures, including reduced  risk weights on bank lending to NBFCs,  are improving liquidity and funding  access for well-governed players. Easing  interest rates are further expected  to support margins and operational  efficiency while ensuring asset quality  remains strong. Delivering growth with  purpose, scale and discipline At Muthoot Finance, our performance  in FY 2024-25 affirms our steadfast  commitment to responsible finance,  inclusive access, and sustainable value  creation.

The units of blood collected through  this effort are now helping patients  battling life-threatening conditions  such as thalassemia, cancer, anaemia,  and accident-related trauma. Beyond  the immediate medical support, the  initiative represents our broader vision  of saving lives through proactive  engagement and public health  partnerships. It is a reminder that even  a single unit of blood can be a lifeline,  and through such efforts, we continue  to build a more compassionate and  resilient society. Inclusion and Accessibility Hearing support for children Through the Muthoot Soundscape  Project, we took a vital step towards  building a more inclusive society by  supporting children with hearing  impairments. By providing advanced  hearing aids to 141 children, the  initiative empowered them with clearer  access to speech, learning, and social  interaction, fundamentals that many  take for granted. For these young  individuals, the ability to hear opens  up a world of opportunity: classrooms  become more accessible, friendships  more fulfilling, and futures more  promising. This effort is not just about  assistive devices, it’s about dignity,  equal opportunity, and a belief that  every child deserves the chance to  thrive. Soundscape exemplifies our  commitment to inclusive development  and ensuring that no child is left behind  in the journey toward education and  self-reliance. Support for the elderly and the  differently abled As part of our commitment to building  an inclusive and compassionate society,  we donated a Maruti EECO van to the  Schumacher Society in Delhi, ensuring  safe, dependable transportation  for underprivileged school children  and elderly citizens. This simple yet  vital support helps bridge the gap  between communities and access  to education, healthcare, and daily  essentials. Additionally, by distributing  battery-operated tricycles and mobility  aids to differently abled individuals, we  enabled greater freedom of movement,  independence, and dignity in their  everyday lives. These interventions  are a testament to our belief that true  development includes empowering  every individual, regardless of age or  ability, to participate fully in society.

Sustainable waste  management In line with our commitment to  sustainability and community  well-being, Muthoot Finance installed  a PET bottle shredding machine at  Periyar Bus Stand, Madurai District,  on 28 March 2025. Implemented in  partnership with Madurai Municipal  Corporation, Yaalini Foundation,  and W2W Enterprises, this initiative  supports cleaner public spaces and  responsible plastic waste disposal. Serving over 10,000 daily commuters,  the high-speed shredding unit can  process up to 25 PET bottles per  minute, offering an effective solution  to managing plastic waste in a  high-traffic urban area. By integrating  technology into public infrastructure,  we aim to reduce plastic pollution and  promote environmental awareness  among citizens. Providing safe drinking water  through jeev jal centres As part of our healthcare-focused  CSR initiatives, Muthoot Finance  installed RO-based purified drinking  water facilities in four schools in  Sri Sathya Sai District, Andhra  Pradesh. These Jeev Jal Centres have  been set up at Dr B.R. Ambedkar  Gurukulam Boys’ School, Hindupur;  Dr B.R. Ambedkar Gurukulam Girls’  School, R. Ramapuram, Nallamada;  MJPAPBCWR School for Boys,  Gundumala; and Dr B.R. Ambedkar  Gurukulam Boys’ School, Maluguru. Together, these facilities now provide  safe, purified drinking water to over  2,500 underprivileged students. The  initiative aims to improve student  health, reduce the risk of waterborne  diseases, and encourage better hygiene  practices within school communities. The facilities were inaugurated by Shri  S.M.N. Swamy, Regional Director,  Reserve Bank of India (Retd.), along  with school officials and representatives  from Muthoot Finance. This intervention  reflects our broader commitment to  supporting public health, particularly  among children, through access to safe  and reliable water infrastructure.

The Company’s Risk Management Committee of  the Board of Directors constituted in accordance with the  Companies Act, applicable RBI regulations, and the SEBI  Listing Regulations has overall responsibility for overseeing  the implementation of the Risk Management Policy. The  committee meets every quarter to review the overall risk  position and the Risk Management practices.

This historical volatility is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of daily stock returns. •   The risk-free rate is equated to the yield on Govemment of India securities corresponding to the expected life of options  in each option series. •   The market value per share is equated with the market value as observed from the adjusted closing market price on grant  date of listed shares of the Company. 94 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant  to the preparation of the Reports and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Inherent limitations The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information  allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between companies.  Measurement of certain indicators, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty,  including, water credit and carbon sequestration. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not  reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 140 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

ANNEXURE 7 Management Discussion and Analysis Economic overview Global economic overview The global economy witnessed stable growth, expanding by 3.3% in 2024, despite geopolitical tensions and structural transitions.  Among advanced economies, the US led with 2.8% growth, buoyed by strong consumer spending and labour market resilience.  The Euro area grew modestly by 0.8%, reflecting efforts to stabilise energy markets and support domestic demand. Emerging  markets expanded by 4.2%, driven by robust growth in India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, while China posted 4.6% growth amid  structural adjustments. Global headline inflation eased to 4.2%, providing central banks some space to recalibrate monetary policy. Though new US tariff measures and countermeasures introduced in early 2025 heightened trade policy uncertainty, 2024  underscored the resilience of global economic fundamentals and the need for adaptive, forward-looking policy frameworks.

Global economic outlook The global economic outlook for 2025 suggests a period of  moderation, shaped by ongoing uncertainty related to trade  and tariffs, evolving financial conditions, and shifts in business  and consumer behaviour. Global GDP growth is expected to  moderate from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.9% in both 2025 and 2026,  with the most notable slowdowns in the US, China, and parts  of North America. Inflation is projected to decline gradually  across many economies, supported by easing supply chain  pressures and stable commodity prices. Investment trends show steady progress, though housing and  public infrastructure development continue to require focused  attention in several countries. While trade tensions and policy  shifts remain factors to watch, opportunities exist for greater  collaboration and dialogue to enhance trade flows and build  resilience. Strengthened fiscal frameworks, structural reforms,  and supportive monetary policies could further underpin  medium-term growth and help address long-term challenges  such as climate adaptation and demographic shifts. https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-economic- outlook-volume-2025-issue-1_83363382-en.html https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/economic- outlook-midyear-2025 Indian economic overview India’s economy has demonstrated impressive strength and  resilience over the past decade. In FY 2024-25, real GDP  expanded by 6.5%, reflecting steady momentum supported by  rising incomes and a strong domestic consumption base. The  services sector remained the largest contributor, accounting for  around 55% of Gross Value Added and providing employment  to nearly 30% of the workforce. Private consumption grew  by 7.3%, reaching its highest share of GDP since FY 2002-03,  underpinned by improving rural demand. On the external front, total exports grew to $825 billion,  driven by sectors such as engineering goods, electronics, and  pharmaceuticals. Services exports more than doubled over the  past decade, highlighting India’s growing integration into the  global economy. Policy reforms and infrastructure investments  continue to support this robust trajectory. Indian economic outlook India’s economic outlook remains largely steady, with GDP  growth projected at 6.4% for FY 2025-26, slightly below the  6.5% recorded in FY 2024-25, the slowest pace in four years.  Growth is expected to pick up modestly to 6.7% in FY 2026-27,  supported by continued government capital expenditure and  resilient domestic demand. While private sector investment  and job creation remain a challenge, strong fundamentals  and policy support, including recent interest rate cuts by the  Reserve Bank of India, are expected to bolster momentum. Risks remain from global uncertainties and stalled trade  negotiations, but India continues to be the world’s fastest- growing major economy, on track to become the third largest  by 2030 with a projected GDP of $7.3 trillion. Sustained  reforms, demographic strengths, and expanding global trade  ties are set to underpin India’s rise as a key driver of global  growth, even as policymakers navigate near-term challenges  and evolving global dynamics. https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails   aspx?NoteId=154660&ModuleId=3#:~:text=In  2024–25 alone,  nominal,estimated at 12% for FY26 . https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-economy-hold- top-spot-growth-underlying-weaknesses-remain-2025-06-27/ 106.57 331.03 India’s Nominal GDP Growth  (₹ Lakh Crore) 2014-15 2024-25 176 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Industry overview Financial services sector In FY 2024-25, India’s financial services sector faced multiple  headwinds, as economic growth slowed, inflation and interest  rates remained elevated, and liquidity in the system remained  tight for most parts of the year. These together weighed on  credit growth. Credit growth moderated but remained steady,  while deposit growth lagged, leading to higher loan-to-deposit  ratios. However, both banks and NBFCs witnessed robust  balance sheets, with improving asset quality and Return on  Assets The RBI stepped in proactively to ease liquidity constraints  by firing on all cylinders. With inflation eventually coming closer  to the central bank’s comfort zone, the RBI cut its policy rate  by 25 bps in February 2025, with an accommodative stance. It  was the first easing since the pandemic. Meanwhile, the central  bank announced regulatory measures to cool off unsecured  lending, as the segment started showing increased stress. Key growth drivers of India’s financial services  sector in FY 2024-25 Banking without barriers:  No-frills Jan   Dhan accounts,  Aadhaar-based identification, and mobile devices have  collectively brought millions into the formal financial fold,  enabling seamless and direct delivery of subsidies. Formalisation of the economy:  With JAM and digital  payments, informal savings and transactions are moving into  regulated channels, improving transparency and expanding  access to credit, insurance, and pensions. Fin-tech driven credit expansion:  FinTech NBFCs have  played a critical role in extending formal credit, disbursing  record volumes of personal loans in FY   2024-25, particularly to  underserved segments. Institutional and regulatory support:  Policies such as priority- sector lending, Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) regulation,  and inclusion mandates support outreach to self-help groups,  microfinance, and rural borrowers, strengthening trust and access. https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/viksit-banking-roadmap- indian-banking-sector-2047.pdf NBFC sector In FY 2024-25, India’s NBFC sector showed resilience amid  moderating credit growth. Overall credit grew by 13-15%,  compared to 17% in previous years, with total NBFC credit  crossing ₹52 trillion by December 2024 and set to exceed ₹60  trillion by FY 2025-26. Retail loans, the key growth driver,  expanded by 16-18%, but faced rising stress in unsecured  segments, such as microfinance and personal loans. Despite regulatory tightening and elevated delinquencies in  unsecured portfolios, NBFCs maintained strong capital positions  and healthy earnings, cushioning sectoral risks. Funding  conditions improved with increased external commercial  borrowings and robust debt issuances. While moderate loan  growth and rising credit costs may pressure margins, sector  liquidity and capital profiles remain stable. Competitive pressures and regulatory changes, including co- lending norms and gold loan guidelines, are expected to shape  the sector further, but the long-term outlook remains steady. https://www.icra.in/CommonService/OpenMediaS3?Key=4a11aca3- 1a1d-4e46-916e-2697687f90ed#:~:text=Growth in  this segment is,60 trillion in FY2026 . Key regulatory measures •   RBI reversed the earlier 25 percentage point increase in risk  weights on bank exposures to NBFCs, easing funding costs  for the sector. •   The RBI advised NBFCs to curb perpetual credit lines, citing  risks of loan evergreening and potential systemic instability. •   The RBI issued a framework for recognising Self-Regulatory  Organisations (SROs) in the Account Aggregator ecosystem,  detailing governance, eligibility, and oversight norms. •   Directions on co-lending outlined blended rate rules,  borrower-level NPA tagging, fee disclosures, and Default  Loss Guarantee (DLG) caps. •   Norms on non-fund-based credit facilities capped  guarantees at 5% of assets with conditions on unsecured  share and tenor. •   Guidelines on lending against gold collateral set a 75- 85% loan-to-value (LTV) cap, including interest accrued,  mandated standardised valuation, and introduced stricter  audit and conduct norms. Gold market The gold market reached new milestones in 2024, with global  demand hitting record highs across sectors. Jewellery remained  the largest segment, accounting for 44% of demand (2,012  tonnes), though volumes declined 11% due to rising prices,  which averaged $2,386/oz (up 23% from 2023). Despite lower  volumes, the total jewellery market value rose 9% to $144  billion, as consumers favoured higher-value pieces. Investment demand surged 25% to 1,180 tonnes, driven by  inflation, geopolitical risks, and renewed ETF interest, pushing  the notional value of investor gold holdings to $5 trillion.  Technology demand grew 7% to 321 tonnes, spurred by  growth in AI, 5G, and green energy sectors.

Central banks purchased over 1,000 tonnes for the third  straight year, cementing gold’s role as a stable reserve asset. Indian gold market Gold holds a central place in Indian households, serving as a  key pillar of wealth and savings. However, shifting consumer  behaviours and increasing global influences are driving changes  in how gold is valued and used. India’s gold market in 2025  has been defined by record-high prices, evolving consumer  behaviour, and notable shifts in investment patterns. Domestic  gold prices have surged over 30% year-to-date, reaching  ₹98,732 per 10g, with the broader Indian gold market estimated  at over $60 billion annually. Amid elevated prices, many buyers  are opting to exchange old jewellery rather than make fresh  purchases, while wedding-related demand continues to anchor  the sector. Corporate retail jewellers logged strong growth in early 2025,  with revenues rising 25–35% y-o-y, supported by higher- value transactions and continued store expansion. Gold ETFs  saw their first net outflow in 10 months in March, despite  cumulative assets under management climbing to ₹589 billion  ($6.8 billion). The RBI has moderated its gold purchases, but  gold’s share in its reserves has risen to 11.7%. March also saw  a sharp rebound in gold imports to $4.4 billion, reflecting  continued appetite despite high prices. Looking ahead, seasonal purchases, gold’s safe-haven appeal,  and sustained investment interest are expected to support  demand amid ongoing global uncertainty.

Key market trends in FY 2024-25 Jewellery demand slows, investment demand resilient:   While jewellery sales have softened after the wedding season,  physical investment demand for bars and coins remains high,  supported by positive price momentum. Consumers are also  increasingly monetising existing gold holdings, leveraging  relaxed norms on gold-backed loans. Gold-backed lending expands sharply:  Lending by  scheduled commercial banks against gold jewellery has surged  nearly 120% y-o-y to ₹2,230 billion ($26 billion), signalling  strong growth in gold-backed credit. Gold ETFs regain inflows:  After two months of outflows, gold  ETFs saw net inflows of ₹2.9 billion ($34 million) in May 2025,  with continued momentum in June. Assets under management  climbed to ₹624 billion ($7.3 billion), up 97% y-o-y, highlighting  gold’s strengthening position as a financial asset. RBI’s gold holding at its highest and gold’s strategic share  grows: The RBI gold holding stood at the highest level of  879tonnes, and gold’s share in total forex reserves has grown  to a record 12.3%. https://www.gold.org/goldhub/gold-focus/2025/06/indias- gold-market-update-mixed-demand Gold loans Gold has great significance for Indians. The preference for  gold jewellery in Indian culture has made it an integral part of  everyday life. From rituals and ceremonies to religious festivities,  adorning gold is considered a good omen. At the same time, it  also provides an opportunity for the common man to invest in  an asset class that is extremely reliable due to its appreciating  value. Gold loans have, therefore, become an easy way of  accessing credit for numerous borrowers, including individuals,  small businesses and micro-enterprises. Globally, India is the  world’s largest market for gold, and the gold loan market in  India flourishes, with around 2,950-3,350 tonnes of gold used  as collateral for instantly availing funds. Southern India has  remained a significant market for gold loans due to the age-old  preference for owning gold. During the year, NBFCs offering  gold loans resiliently retained their market share despite stiff  competition faced by banks. The Assets Under Management  of most gold loan providers increased significantly due to the  rising credit demand for small and mid-sized loans. Besides,  digital adoption has played an integral role in streamlining  loan processing. NBFCs demonstrated significant resilience  and proved the ability to compete against larger financial  institutions. The growth in housing and infrastructure loans  further increased the contribution of NBFCs to the financial  services industry. ICRA Ltd in its research report published in September 2024  stated that it expects the organised gold loan market consisting  of Universal Banks & NBFCs to exceed Rs 10 trillion in the  current fiscal and further reach Rs.. 15trillion by March 2027.  Public sector banks remain a dominant player in the space,  driven by agriculture loans that are backed by gold ornaments.  NBFCs have maintained their sizeable market share in retail,  notwithstanding the recent sharp scale-up by banks in this  space. Competition from banks has increased as more banks  are upscaling their branches to offer Gold Loans. ( https://www.icra.in/Research/ViewResearchReport/5919 ) Features of gold loan Fast processing and minimal documentation:  Since the  loan is secured against physical gold, lenders require limited  paperwork and eligibility checks, resulting in quick approvals  and disbursals. Instant access to liquidity:  Gold loans provide ‘anytime  liquidity,’ with funds often available within 10-30 minutes,  offering immediate financial support when needed. Low interest rates:  Gold loans generally have more attractive  interest rates than unsecured loans like personal loans, making  them a cost-effective option for borrowers. Flexible interest payment options:  Borrowers can choose  to pay only the interest during the loan tenure and repay the  principal amount at the end, providing greater financial flexibility. No income or credit score requirements:  Lenders generally  do not require proof of income or credit history since the gold  itself secures the loan, making gold loans accessible to a wider  range of borrowers.

Financial review Please see page 20 of the report for financial highlights. Risk management Muthoot Finance recognises the evolving risks inherent to its business and has established a comprehensive risk management  framework. The Risk Management Committee oversees this framework, ensuring effective identification, mitigation, and  monitoring of risks that could impact our growth and operations. Risk Description Mitigation strategies Operational risk Any direct or indirect losses incurred due  to personnel, failures while implementing  processes or external incidents. There exists a strategic system and stringent process to mitigate  operational risks. Along with centralised monitoring systems and  surveillance cameras to prevent operational hazards, the employees  are offered proper training to identify duplicate gold and fraudulent  attempts. There is an audit personnel along with the centralised  system to regularly monitor the overall risk management. Collateral risk Muthoot Finance can be impacted by a fall in  gold prices to an extent where its profitability  can be negatively affected. The policy of retaining 25% of the gold price while calculating the  loan amount is maintained. The sentimental value of gold jewellery  drives redemption even if the value of the collateral falls below the  repayment amount, thereby protecting the Company from any  untoward risks. Credit risk This arises when the counterparty fails to  abide by the terms and conditions of the  financial contract imposed by Muthoot  Finance. Strict loan approval and collateral evaluation processes are  implemented. In addition to this, it has a non-performance asset  monitoring process and an effective collection approach to  minimise the impact of the credit risk on the operations. Moreover,  the credit risk is also mitigated through the collateral’s liquidity. Market risk Unfavourable changes in the interest rate can  undermine operational efficiency. The increased interest rates are passed on to the borrowers to  minimise the negative impact of fluctuations in the interest rates.  Along with this, maintaining the fixed rate of interest for bulk  borrowings and loans as well as advances remained integral to  effectively managing the risks. Liquidity risk Challenges arise due to the failure to raise  cash at the best possible rate from the market,  undermining the operational strength and  ability to strategically manage the debt. There is regular interaction with the Asset and Liabilities  Management Committee and ALCO Committee to understand the  liquidity position based on future cash flows. Moreover, Muthoot  Finance faces minimal liquidity risk owing to its diverse funding  sources such as debentures, bank loans with longer maturity and  external commercial borrowings. Business cycle risk The risk faced due to the cyclical nature of the  industry affects the operations of Muthoot  Finance The pan-India presence of Muthoot Finance cushions it against  uncertainties in the external environment and protects against risks  associated with the cyclical nature of the industry.

Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of  Muthoot Finance Limited Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying standalone financial  statements of Muthoot Finance Limited (“the Company”),  which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the  Statement of Profit and Loss including Other Comprehensive  Income, the Statement of Changes In Equity and the  Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes  to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of  material accounting policies and other explanatory information  (hereinafter referred to as the “standalone financial  statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone  financial statements give the information required by the  Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required  and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian  Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the  Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, as amended, (‘Ind AS’) and other accounting  principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs  of the Company as at March 31, 2025, and its profits, total  comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows  for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements  in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified  under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under  those Standards are further described in the “Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Financial  Statements” section of our report. We are independent of the  Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together  with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of  the standalone financial statements under the provisions of  the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled  our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone  financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements of the current year. These  matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters. We have determined the matters described  below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in  our report. Key Audit Matters How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matters 1.   Allowances for expected credit losses (‘ECL’):     As at March 31, 2025, the carrying value of loan assets carried  at amortised cost, aggregated  H  10,86,809.72 million (net of  allowance for expected credit loss  H  15,730.78 million) constituting  89.63% of the Company’s total assets. Significant judgement is  used in classifying these loan assets and applying appropriate  measurement principles. ECL on such loan assets carried at  amortised cost is a critical estimate involving greater level of  Management judgement. As part of our risk assessment, we  determined that the ECL on such loan assets has a high degree  of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable  outcomes for the standalone financial statements. The elements  of estimating ECL which involved increased level of audit focus are  the following: •   Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the loan  assets carried at amortised cost; •   Basis used for estimating probabilities of default (‘PD’), loss  given default (‘LGD’) and exposure at default (‘EAD’) at product  level with past trends; We have examined the policies approved by the Board of Directors of  the Company that articulate the objectives of managing each portfolio  and their business models. We have also checked the methodology  adopted for computation of the ECL Model, including the policies  approved by the Board of Directors, procedures, and controls for  assessing and measuring credit risk on all lending exposures carried  at amortised cost, and its compliance with Ind AS 109. Additionally,  we have confirmed that adjustments to the output of the ECL Model  are consistent with the documented rationale and basis for such  adjustments and that the amount of adjustments have been approved  by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our audit procedures  related to the allowance for ECL included the following, among others: Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the following: •   Completeness and accuracy of the EAD and the classification thereof  into stages consistent with the definitions applied in accordance  with the policy approved by the Board of Directors including the  appropriateness of the qualitative factors to be applied; 190 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Key Audit Matters How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matters •   Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios and  probability weights applied to reflect future economic  conditions; and •   Adjustments to model driven ECL results to address emerging    trends.   (Refer note no. 8 and 42 to the standalone financial statements). •   Completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of information  used in the estimation of the PD and LGD for the different stages  depending on the nature of the portfolio; •   Accuracy of the computation of the ECL estimate including  reasonableness of the methodology used to determine macro- economic overlays and adjustments to the output of the ECL  model; and Test of details on a sample basis in respect of the following: •   Accuracy and completeness of the input data such as period of  default and other related information used in estimating the PD; •   The mathematical accuracy of the ECL computation by using the  same input data as used by the Company. •   Completeness and accuracy of the staging of the loans and  the underlying data based on which the ECL estimates have  been computed. •   Evaluating the adequacy of the adjustment after stressing the  inputs used in determining the output as per the ECL model to  ensure that the adjustment was in conformity with the overlay  amount approved by the Audit Committee of the Company. 2.   Information technology and general controls:     The Company relies heavily on its information technology (IT)  systems due to the high volume of transactions processed daily  across multiple, discrete platforms. Effective IT application controls  are essential to ensure that any changes to applications and the  underlying data are implemented appropriately and within a  controlled environment. These controls play a vital role in mitigating  the risk of errors or potential fraud arising from unauthorized or  inappropriate changes. Given the pervasive use of IT systems in  the Company’s financial reporting processes, the evaluation and  testing of general IT controls were considered a key audit matter. We obtained an understanding of the Company’s IT applications,  databases and operating systems relevant to financial reporting.  Our focus areas within the IT infrastructure included access security,  program change controls, database management, and network  operations. Specifically: •   We tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness  of the Company’s general IT controls over systems relevant to  financial reporting. This included an assessment of controls related  to segregation of duties and the provisioning or modification of  access rights based on appropriately authorized requests. •   We also evaluated key automated business process controls and the  logic of system-generated reports that were relevant to financial  reporting or were used in the operation of internal financial  controls over the standalone financial statements. In addition, we  performed alternate procedures to assess whether any unmitigated  IT risks existed that could materially impact the standalone  financial statements. 3.   Related Party Transactions:     We identified related party transactions as a key audit matter  due to their financial and regulatory significance, the complexity  involved in their identification and approval, and the inherent risk  of non-disclosure or misstatement in the financial statements. •   We obtained an understanding of the Company’s policies  for identifying and disclosing related party relationships  and transactions. •   We inspected minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and  the Audit Committee to assess whether related party transactions  were deliberated, reviewed, and approved in line with regulatory  and governance requirements. •   On a sample basis, we tested related party transactions by examining  underlying agreements, approvals, and supporting documentation  to evaluate whether the transactions were appropriately recorded,  disclosed, and conducted in the ordinary course of business and at  arm’s length. •   We assessed compliance with Sections   177 and 188 of the  Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI (LODR) Regulations—with respect  to authorisation, approvals, disclosures, and required reporting. •   We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of related party  disclosures in the financial statements in accordance with Ind AS 24. Standalone  / Financial Statements 191 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Information other than the Standalone Financial  Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon The Company’s Management and Board of Directors is  responsible for the other information. The other information  comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but  does not include the standalone financial statements and our  auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be  made available to us after that date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not  cover the other information and we do not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is  materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements  or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears  to be materially misstated. When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a  material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate  the matter to those charged with governance as required  under SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to Other  Information’. Responsibility of Management and Board  of Directors’ for the standalone financial  statements The Company’s Management and Board of Directors is  responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act  with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial  statements that give a true and fair view of the financial  position, financial performance including other comprehensive  income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in  accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted  in India, including the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the  Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes  maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance  with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of  the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and  other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate  accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that  are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,  that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the  preparation and presentation of the standalone financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management  and Board of Directors’ are responsible for assessing the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless management and  Board of Directors’ either intends to liquidate the Company or  to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Management and Board of Directors are also responsible  for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to  issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism  throughout the audit. We also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud  or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The  risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls  relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i)  of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion  on whether the Company has adequate internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial statements  in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by management. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of  the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty  192 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going  concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to  the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements  or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained  up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future  events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to  continue as a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  standalone financial statements, including the disclosures,  and whether the standalone financial statements represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone  financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes  it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably  knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements  may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and  qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work  and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate  the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone  financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and  where applicable, related safeguards From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law  or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or  when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a  matter should not be communicated in our report because  the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably  be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of  such communication. Other Matters The annual standalone financial statements of the Company  for the year ended March 31, 2024, were audited by erstwhile  joint auditors whose audit report dated May 30, 2024,  expressed an unmodified opinion on those annual standalone  financial statements. Our opinion is not modified in respect of  this matter. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory  Requirements 1.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal  Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing  and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to  the standalone financial statements based on the internal  control criteria established by the Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note issued by the ICAI. These responsibilities include the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring  the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including  adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under  the Companies Act, 2013. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial  statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in  accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the  Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the  Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of  internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance  Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and  plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether adequate internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements was established  and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all  material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  with reference to standalone financial statements and their  operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls  with reference to standalone financial statements included  obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements, assessing the risk  that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the  design and operating effectiveness of internal control based  on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the financial statements, whether  due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements. Meaning of Internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements is a process designed to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls  with reference to standalone financial statements includes those  policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorizations of management and  Directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial  statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to standalone financial statements, including  the possibility of collusion or improper management override  of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may  occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  202 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

Statement of Compliance     The financial statements of the Company have been  prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended  from time to time). These financial statements may  require further adjustments, if any, necessitated by the  guidelines/clarifications/directions issued in the future by  RBI, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, or other regulators,  which will be implemented as and when the same are  issued and made applicable. 2.2.   Basis of measurement     The financial statements have been prepared on a  historical cost basis, except for following assets and  liabilities which have been measured at fair value:   i)     fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI) instruments,   ii)   derivative financial instruments,   iii)   other financial assets held for trading,   iv)     financial assets and liabilities designated at fair  value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 2.3.     The financial statements of the Company are presented  as per Schedule III (Division III) of the Companies Act,  2013 applicable to NBFCs, as notified by the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs (MCA). Financial assets and financial  liabilities are generally reported on a gross basis except  when, there is an unconditional legally enforceable  right to offset the recognised amounts without being  contingent on a future event and the parties intend to  settle on a net basis. 2.4.

Revenue Recognition 3.1.1. Recognition of interest income     The Company recognises Interest income by applying  the effective interest rate (EIR) to the gross carrying  210 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements amount of a financial asset except for purchased or  originated credit-impaired financial assets and other  credit-impaired financial assets.     For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial  assets, the Company applies the credit-adjusted  effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the  financial asset from initial recognition.     For other credit-impaired financial assets, the Company  applies effective interest rate to the amortised cost of  the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods.     The effective interest rate on a financial asset is the rate  that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts  through the expected life of the financial asset to  the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. While  estimating future cash receipts, factors like expected  behaviour and life cycle of the financial asset, probable  fluctuation in collateral value etc. are considered which  has an impact on the EIR.     While calculating the effective interest rate, the  Company includes all fees and points paid or received  to and from the borrowers that are an integral part of  the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all  other premiums or discounts.     Interest income on all trading assets and financial  assets required to be measured at FVTPL is recognised  using the contractual interest rate as net gain on fair  value changes. 3.1.2     .    Recognition of revenue from sale of goods or  services     Revenue (other than for Financial Instruments within  the scope of Ind AS 109) is measured at an amount that  reflects the considerations, to which an entity expects  to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or  services to customer, excluding amounts collected on  behalf of third parties.     The Company recognises revenue from contracts with  customers based on a five-step model as set out in    Ind AS 115:     Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract  is defined as an agreement between two or more  parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations  and sets out the criteria for every contract that must  be met.     Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the  contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a  contract with a customer to transfer a good or service  to the customer.     Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction  price is the amount of consideration to which the  Company expects to be entitled in exchange for  transferring promised goods or services to a customer,  excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.     Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the  performance obligations in the contract: For a contract  that has more than one performance obligation, the  Company allocates the transaction price to each  performance obligation in an amount that depicts  the amount of consideration to which the Company  expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each  performance obligation.     Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company  satisfies a performance obligation     Revenue from contract with customer for rendering  services is recognised at a point in time when  performance obligation is satisfied. 3.1.3. Recognition of Dividend Income     Dividend income (including from FVOCI investments) is  recognised when the Company’s right to receive the  payment is established. This is established when it is  probable that the economic benefits associated with  the dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of  the dividend can be measured reliably. 3.1.4. Net gain/loss on fair value changes     The Company designates certain financial assets for  subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or  Standalone  / Financial Statements 211 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive  income (FVOCI). The Company recognises gains/loss  on fair value change of financial assets measured at  FVTPL and realised gains on derecognition of financial  asset measured at FVTPL and FVOCI on net basis. In  cases there is a net gain in the aggregate, the same is  recognised in ‘Net gains on fair value changes’ under  Revenue from operations and if there is a net loss the  same is disclosed under ‘Expenses’ in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. 3.2.   Financial instruments A.    Financial Assets 3.2.1. Initial recognition and measurement     All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value  when the Company become party to the contractual  provisions of the financial asset. In case of financial  assets which are not recorded at fair value through profit  or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable  to the acquisition or issue of the financial assets, are  adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. 3.2.2. Subsequent measurement     The Company classifies its financial assets into various  measurement categories. The classification depends  on the contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash  flows and the Company’s business model for managing  financial assets.   a)   Financial assets measured at amortised cost       A financial asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it  is held within a business model whose objective is  to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash  flows and the contractual terms of the Financial  Asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that  are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.   b)    Financial assets measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)       A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it is  held within a business model whose objective is  achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows  and selling financial assets and contractual terms of  financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash  flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding.   c)    Financial assets measured at fair value  through profit or loss (FVTPL)       A financial asset which is not classified in any of the  above categories are measured at FVTPL. 3.2.3.    Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint  Ventures     The Company has accounted for its investments in  Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures at cost less  impairment loss, if any. 3.2.4. Other Equity Investments     All other equity investments are measured at fair value,  with value changes recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss, except for those equity investments for which  the Company has elected to present the changes in fair  value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). B.   Financial liabilities 3.2.5. Initial recognition and measurement     All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value  when  the Company become party to the contractual  provisions of the financial liability. In case of financial  liability which are not recorded at fair value through  profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial  liabilities, are adjusted to the fair value on initial  recognition. The Company’s financial liabilities include  trade and other payables, non-convertible debentures  loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts. 212 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements 3.2.6. Subsequent Measurement       Financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss which includes derivative  financial instruments are subsequently carried at  amortised cost using the effective interest method.  Subsequent measurement of derivative financial  instruments are at fair value as detailed under Note 3.7  ‘Derivative Financial Instruments’ 3.3.       Derecognition of financial assets and  liabilities 3.3.1.  Financial Asset     The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset  expire or it transfers its contractual rights to receive  the cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction  in which substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership are transferred. On derecognition of a  financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:  (a) the carrying amount (measured at the date of  derecognition) and (b) the consideration received  (including any new asset obtained less any new  liability assumed) shall be recognised in profit or loss.  Any rights and obligations created or retained in the  transfer of such financial assets by the Company is  recognized as a separate asset or liability. 3.3.2. Financial Liability     A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation  under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.  Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another  from the same lender on substantially different terms,  or the terms of an existing liability are substantially  modified, such an exchange or modification is treated  as de-recognition of the original liability and the  recognition of a new liability. The difference between  the carrying value of the original financial liability and  the consideration paid is recognised in the Statement  of profit and loss. 3.4.   Offsetting     Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally  reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and  liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in  the balance sheet when the Company has a legal right to  offset the amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or  to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously  in all the following circumstances:   a)   The normal course of business   b)   The event of default   c)     The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the  Company and/or its counterparties 3.5.   Impairment of financial assets     In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses  ‘Expected Credit Loss’ model (ECL), for evaluating  impairment of financial assets other than those measured  at Fair value through profit or loss. 3.5.1.    Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model     Expected Credit Loss, at each reporting date, is  measured through a loss allowance for a financial asset: •   At an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit  losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument  has increased significantly since initial recognition. •   At an amount equal to 12-month expected credit  losses, if the credit risk on a financial instrument has  not increased significantly since initial recognition.     Lifetime expected credit losses means expected credit  losses that result from all possible default events over  the expected life of a financial asset.     12-month expected credit losses means the portion of  Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that result from  default events on financial assets that are possible  within the 12 months after the reporting date.     The Company performs an assessment, at the end of  each reporting period, of whether a financial assets  credit risk has increased significantly since initial  recognition. When making the assessment, the change  in the risk of a default occurring over the expected  life of the financial instrument is used instead of the  change in the amount of expected credit losses. Standalone  / Financial Statements 213 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements     Based on the above process, the Company categorises  its loans into three stages as described below: •   Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial  assets which have not experienced a significant  increase in credit risk since initial recognition.  A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1  financial assets. In assessing whether credit risk has  increased significantly, the Company compares the  risk of a default occurring on the financial asset  as at the reporting date with the risk of a default  occurring on the financial asset as at the date of  initial recognition. •   Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial  assets which have experienced a significant increase  in credit risk since initial recognition. The Company  recognises lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial assets.  In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of  the financial instrument improves such that there  is no longer a significant increase in credit risk  since initial recognition, then entities shall revert to  recognizing 12 months ECL provision. •   Financial assets are classified as Stage 3 when there  is objective evidence of impairment as a result of  one or more loss events that have occurred after  initial recognition with a negative impact on the  estimated future cash flows of a loan or a portfolio  of loans. The Company recognises lifetime ECL for  impaired financial assets. 3.5.2. Estimation of Expected Credit Loss     The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined  below and the key elements are as follows:     Probability of Default (PD) -  The Probability of  Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over  a given time horizon.     The Company uses historical information where  available to determine PD. Considering the different  products and schemes, the Company has bifurcated  its loan portfolio into various pools. For certain pools  where historical information is available, the PD is  calculated considering fresh slippage of past years.  For those pools where historical information is not  available, the PD/default rates as stated by external  reporting agencies is considered.       Exposure at Default (EAD) -  The Exposure at Default  is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date,  considering expected changes in the exposure after the  reporting date, including repayments of principal and  interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise,  expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and  accrued interest from missed payments.     Loss Given Default (LGD) -  The Loss Given Default  is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where  a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the  difference between the contractual cash flows due  and those that the lender would expect to receive,  including from the realisation of any collateral.   Forward-looking information     While estimating the expected credit losses, the  Company reviews macro-economic developments  occurring in the economy and market it operates. On  a periodic basis, the Company analyses if there is any  relationship between key economic trends like GDP,  unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by the  Reserve Bank of India, in fl ation etc. with the estimate  of PD, LGD determined by the Company based on its  internal data. While the internal estimates of PD, LGD  rates by the Company may not be always re fl ective  of such relationships, temporary overlays, if any, are  embedded in the methodology to re fl ect such macro- economic trends reasonably.     To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the  Company seeks to use collateral, where possible.  The collateral comes in various forms, such as cash,  securities, letters of credit/guarantees, vehicles,  etc. However, the fair value of collateral affects  the calculation of ECL. The collateral is majorly the  property for which the loan is given. The fair value of  the same is based on data provided by third party or  management judgements. 214 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements     Loans are written off (either partially or in full)  when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This  is generally the case when the Company determines  that the borrower does not have assets or sources  of income that could generate suf fi cient cash  fl ows  to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any  subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited  to the Statement of Pro fi t and Loss. 3.6.    Determination of fair value of Financial  Instruments     The Company measures financial instruments, such as,  investments at fair value at each balance sheet date.     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.  The fair value measurement is based on the presumption  that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the  liability takes place either:   i.   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or   ii.     In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability.     The principal or the most advantageous market must be  accessible by the Company.     The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using  the assumptions that market participants would use  when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market  participants act in their economic best interest.     A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes  into account a market participant’s ability to generate  economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and  best use or by selling it to another market participant  that would use the asset in its highest and best use.     The Company uses valuation techniques that are  appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient  data are available to measure fair value, maximising the  use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use  of unobservable inputs.     The financial instruments are classified based on a  hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below:     Level 1 financial instruments − Those where the inputs  used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from  active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the  Company has access to at the measurement date. The  Company considers markets as active only if there are  sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume  and liquidity of the identical assets or liabilities and when  there are binding and exercisable price quotes available  on the balance sheet date.     Level 2 financial instruments − Those where the inputs  that are used for valuation and are significant, are  derived from directly or indirectly observable market  data available over the entire period of the instrument’s  life. Such inputs include quoted prices for similar assets  or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical  instruments in inactive markets and observable inputs  other than quoted prices such as interest rates and  yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit spreads. In  addition, adjustments may be required for the condition  or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates  to items that are comparable to the valued instrument.  However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable  inputs which are significant to the entire measurement,  the Company will classify the instruments as Level 3.     Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one  or more unobservable input that is signi fi cant to the  measurement as whole. 3.7.   Derivative financial instruments     The Company enters into derivative financial instruments  such as foreign exchange forward contracts and cross  currency swaps to manage its exposure to foreign  exchange rate risk and interest rate swaps to manage its  interest rate risk.     Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the  date when a derivative contract is entered into and are  subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each  balance sheet date and carried as assets when their fair  value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value  Standalone  / Financial Statements 215 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements is negative. The resulting gain/loss is recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the  derivative is designated and is effective as a hedging  instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition  in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the  nature of the hedge relationship. The Company has  designated the derivative financial instruments as cash  flow hedges of recognised liabilities and unrecognised  firm commitments.   Hedge accounting     In order to manage particular risks, the Company  applies hedge accounting for transactions that meet  specific criteria.     At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company  formally designates and documents the hedge  relationship and the risk management objective and  strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Company enters  into derivative financial instruments that have critical  terms aligned with the hedged item and in accordance  with the Risk management policy of the Company, the  hedging relationship is extended to the entire term  of the hedged item. The hedges are expected to be  highly effective if the hedging instrument is offsetting  changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item  attributable to the hedged risk. The assessment of  hedge effectiveness is carried out at inception and on an  ongoing basis to determine that the hedging relationship  has been effective throughout the financial reporting  periods for which they were designated.   Cash Flow Hedges     A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to  variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular  risk associated with a recognised asset or liability (such  as all or some future interest payments on variable rate  debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and could  affect profit and loss. For designated and qualifying cash  flow hedges, the effective portion of the cumulative gain  or loss on the hedging instrument is initially recognised  directly in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) within  equity (cash flow hedge reserve). The ineffective portion  of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised  immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The  Company designates the spot element of foreign currency  forward contracts as hedging instruments. The changes  in the fair value of forward element of the forward  contract on reporting date is deferred and retained in  the cost of hedging reserve. When the hedged cash flow  affects the Statement of Profit and Loss, the effective  portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is  recorded in the corresponding income or expense line  of the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a hedging  instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or  when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge  accounting, any cumulative gain or loss that has been  recognised in OCI at that time remains in OCI and is  recognised when the hedged forecast transaction is  ultimately recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected  to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in  OCI is immediately transferred to the Statement of Profit  and Loss. 3.8.   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at banks  and on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of  three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant  risk of changes in value.     For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and  cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits,  as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts if  any, as they are considered as an integral part of the  Company’s cash management. 3.9.   Property, plant and equipment     Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less  accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment,  if any. Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment  comprises its purchase price, including import duties  and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting  trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable  cost of bringing the item to its working condition for  its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and  removing the item and restoring the site on which it  is located. 216 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements     Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets,  outstanding at each reporting date are shown under  other non-financial assets. The cost of property, plant  and equipment not ready for its intended use at each  reporting date are disclosed as capital work-in-progress.     Subsequent expenditure related to the asset are added  to its carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset  only if it increases the future benefits of the existing  asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of  performance and cost can be measured reliably. Other  repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and  when incurred. 3.9.1. Depreciation     Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment is  calculated using written down value method to write  down the cost of property, plant and equipment to their  residual values over their estimated useful lives which  is in line with the estimated useful life as specified in  Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.   The estimated useful lives are as follows: Particulars Useful life  Furniture and fixture 10 years  Office equipment 5 years  Server and networking  6 years  Computer  3 years Building 30 years Building RCC Frame Structure 60 years Vehicles 8 years Wind Mill 22 years     The residual values, useful lives and methods of  depreciation of property, plant and equipment are  reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate. Changes in the expected  useful life are accounted for by changing the  amortisation period or methodology, as appropriate,  and treated as changes in accounting estimates.  Property, plant, and equipment with an individual  acquisition cost not exceeding ₹5,000 shall be expensed  in the year of purchase.     Property, plant and equipment is derecognised on  disposal or when no future economic benefits are  expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on  derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying  amount of the asset) is recognised in other income/ expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year  the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an  item of property, plant and equipment is the date the  recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with  the requirements for determining when a performance  obligation is satisfied in Ind AS 115. 3.10. Intangible assets     An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost  can be measured reliably and it is probable that the  expected future economic benefits that are attributable  to it will flow to the Company.     Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on  initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset  comprises its purchase price including import duties  and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting  trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable  cost of bringing the item to its working condition for its  intended use. Following initial recognition, intangible  assets are carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.     Subsequent expenditure related to the asset is added  to its carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset  only if it increases the future benefits of the existing  asset, beyond its previously assessed standards of  performance and cost can be measured reliably.     Intangible assets comprising of software is amortised  on straight-line  basis over a period of 5 years, unless it  has a shorter useful life.     Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible  assets are measured as the difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the  asset are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  when the asset is derecognised.

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements 3.11.    Impairment of non-financial assets:  Property, Plant and Equipment and  Intangible Assets     The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether  there is any indication that any Property, Plant and  Equipment and Intangible Assets or group of assets  called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If  any such indication exists, or when annual impairment  testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates  the asset’s recoverable amount to determine the extent  of impairment, if any.     An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an  asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and  its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for  an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate  cash inflows that are largely independent of those from  other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying  amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable  amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written  down to its recoverable amount.     In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash  flows are discounted to their present value using a  pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs  of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into  account. If no such transactions can be identified, an  appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations  are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share  prices for publicly traded companies or other available  fair value indicators.     An assessment is made at each reporting date to  determine whether there is an indication that previously  recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have  decreased. If such indication exists, the Company  estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A  previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only  if there has been a change in the assumptions used to  determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last  impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited  so that the carrying amount of the asset does not  exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined, net of  depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised  for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset is  carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal  is treated as a revaluation increase. 3.12. Finance Cost     Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised  by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the  gross carrying amount of financial liabilities other than  financial liabilities classified as FVTPL.   The EIR in case of a financial liability is computed:   a)       As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future  cash payments through the expected life of the  financial liability to the gross carrying amount of  the amortised cost of a financial liability.   b)    By considering all the contractual terms of the  financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.   c)    Including all fees paid between parties to the  contract that are an integral part of the effective  interest rate, transaction costs, and all other  premiums or discounts.     Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the  future cash flows is recognised in interest expense with  the corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount  of the financial liability.     Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially  recognised as part of the carrying value of the financial  liability and amortised over the expected life using  the effective interest method. These include fees and  commissions payable to advisers and other expenses  such as external legal costs, rating fee etc, provided  these are incremental costs that are directly related to  the issue of a financial liability. 218 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

Employee Benefits Expenses 3.14.1. Short-Term Employee Benefits     The undiscounted amount of short-term employee  benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the  services rendered by employees are recognised as  an expense during the period when the employees  render the services 3.14.2. Post-Employment Benefits   A.   Defined contribution schemes       All eligible employees of the Company are entitled  to receive benefits under the provident fund,  a defined contribution plan in which both the  employee and the Company contribute monthly at  a stipulated percentage of the covered employee’s  salary. Contributions are made to Employees  Provident Fund Organization in respect of Provident  Fund, Pension Fund and Employees Deposit Linked  Insurance Scheme at the prescribed rates and are  charged to Statement of Profit and Loss at actuals.  The Company has no liability for future provident  fund benefits other than its annual contribution.   B.   Defined Benefit schemes    Gratuity       The Company provides for gratuity covering eligible  employees under which a lumpsum payment is  paid to vested employees at retirement, death,  incapacitation or termination of employment, of  an amount reckoned on the respective employee’s  salary and his tenor of employment with the  Company. The Company accounts for its liability  for future gratuity benefits based on actuarial  valuation determined at each Balance Sheet date by  an Independent Actuary using Projected Unit Credit  Method. The Company makes annual contribution  to a Gratuity Fund administered by Trustees and  separate schemes managed by Kotak Mahindra Life  Insurance Company Limited and/or ICICI Prudential  Life Insurance Company Limited.       The obligation is measured at the present value  of the estimated future cash flows. The discount  rates used for determining the present value of the  obligation under defined benefit plan are based on  the market yields on Government Securities as at  the Balance Sheet date.       An actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include  the determination of the discount rate, future  salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities involved in the valuation and its long- term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to  changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are  reviewed at each reporting date.       Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains  and losses (excluding amounts included in net  interest on the net de fi ned bene fi t liability), are  recognized immediately in the balance sheet with  a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings  through Other Comprehensive Income in the period  in which they occur. Re-measurements are not  reclassi fi ed to pro fi t and loss in subsequent periods. 3.14.3. Other Long-term employee benefits   Accumulated compensated absences     The Company provides for liability of accumulated  compensated absences for eligible employees on the  basis of an independent actuarial valuation carried out  at the end of the year, using the projected unit credit  method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period in  which they occur. 3.14.4. Employee Share-based payments     Stock options granted to the employees under the  stock option scheme established are accounted as  Standalone  / Financial Statements 219 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements per the accounting treatment prescribed by the SEBI  (Share-based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014  issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India.     The Company follows the fair value method of  accounting for the options and accordingly, the excess  of market value of the stock options as on the date of  grant over the fair value of the options is recognised as  deferred employee compensation cost and is charged  to the Statement of Profit and Loss on graded vesting  basis over the vesting period of the options.     The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected  as additional share dilution in the computation of  diluted earnings per share. 3.15. Provisions     Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result  of past events, and it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits will be  required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate  can be made of the amount of the obligation.     When the effect of the time value of money is material,  the enterprise determines the level of provision by  discounting the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate  reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The  expense relating to any provision is presented in the  Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. 3.16. Taxes     Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax  and deferred tax. 3.16.1 Current Tax     Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable  in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable  profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in  the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items  of income or expense that are taxable or deductible  in other years and items that are never taxable or  deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.     The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the  amount are those that are enacted, or substantively  enacted, by the end of reporting date in India where  the Company operates and generates taxable income.     Current income tax relating to items recognised outside  profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss i.e.,  either in other comprehensive income or in equity.  Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the  underlying transaction either in other comprehensive  income or directly in equity. Management periodically  evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect  to situations in which applicable tax regulations are  subject to interpretation and establishes provisions  where appropriate. 3.16.2 Deferred tax     Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at  the reporting date between the tax bases of assets  and liabilities used in the computation of taxable profit  and their carrying amounts in the financial statements  for financial reporting purposes.     Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable  temporary differences, except:   i.     Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial  recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a  transaction that is not a business combination and,  at the time of the transaction, affects neither the  accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss   ii.     In respect of taxable temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  where the timing of the reversal of the temporary  differences can be controlled and it is probable that  the temporary differences will not reverse in the  foreseeable future     Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible  temporary differences, the carry forward of unused  tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax  assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable  that taxable profit will be available against which  the deductible temporary differences, and the carry  220 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses  can be utilised, except:   i.    When the deferred tax asset relating to the  deductible temporary difference arises from  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a  transaction that is not a business combination and,  at the time of the transaction, affects neither the  accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss   ii.    In respect of deductible temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred  tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is  probable that the temporary differences will reverse  in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be  available against which the temporary differences  can be utilised     The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed  at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that  it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit  will be available to allow all or part of the deferred  tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax  assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are  recognised to the extent that it has become probable  that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax  asset to be recovered.     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when  the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based  on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or  substantively enacted at the reporting date.     Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit  or loss is recognised outside profit or loss ie., either in  other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax  items are recognised in correlation to the underlying  transaction either in other comprehensive income or  directly in equity.     Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are  offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off  current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the  deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and  the same taxation authority. 3.17. Contingent Liabilities and Assets     A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises  from past events whose existence will be con fi rmed  by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more  uncertain future events beyond the control of the  Company or a present obligation that is not recognized  because it is not probable that an out fl ow of resources  will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent  liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there  is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot  be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize  a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the  fi nancial statements.     A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from  past events and whose existence will be con fi rmed only  by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more  uncertain future events not wholly within the control of  the entity. The Company does not have any contingent  assets in the  fi nancial statements. 3.18. Earnings Per Share     The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per  share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per  share (EPS). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the  net pro fi t or loss for the year attributable to equity  shareholders (after deducting preference dividend and  attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the year.     For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net  pro fi t or loss for the year attributable to equity  shareholders and the weighted average number of  shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the  effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive  potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the  beginning of the period, unless they have been issued  at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per  share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and  that either reduces the earnings per share or increases  loss per share are included.

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements 3.19. Foreign currency transactions     Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the  functional currency of the Company at the exchange  rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate  if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the  date of the transaction.     Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are translated into the functional currency at  the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary  assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in  a foreign currency are translated into the functional  currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was  determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that  are measured based on historical cost in a foreign  currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date  of the transaction. Exchange differences are recognised  in the Statement of profit and loss. 3.20. Cash-flow statement     Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of  transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or  accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments.  The cash flows from regular revenue generating,  investing and financing activities of the Company  are segregated. 3.21. Leases     Effective April 01, 2019, the Company had applied Ind  AS 116 ‘Leases’ to all lease contracts existing on April 01,  2019 by adopting the modified retrospective approach.     The Company evaluates each contract or arrangement,  whether it qualifies as lease as defined under Ind  AS 116. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the  contract conveys the right to control the use of an  identified asset.   The Company as a lessee     The Company has elected not to recognise right-of use  assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that  have a lease term of less than or equal to 12 months and  leases with low value assets. The Company determines  the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease,  together with periods covered by an option to extend  the lease, where the Company is reasonably certain to  exercise that option.     The Company recognises the lease payments associated  with these leases as an expense in Statement of  Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the lease  term or another systematic basis if that basis is more  representative of the pattern of the lessee’s benefit. The  related cash flows are classified as operating activities.     Wherever the above exception permitted under Ind  AS 116 is not applicable, the Company at the time of  initial recognition: •   measures lease liability as present value of all  lease payments discounted using the Company’s  incremental cost of borrowing and directly  attributable costs. Subsequently, the lease liability  is increased by interest on lease liability, reduced  by lease payments made and remeasured to reflect  any reassessment or lease modifications specified  in Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’, or to reflect revised fixed  lease payments. •   measures ‘Right-of-use assets’ as present value of  all lease payments discounted using the Company’s  incremental cost of borrowing and any initial  direct costs. Subsequently, ‘Right-of-use assets’  is measured using cost model i.e. at cost less any  accumulated depreciation (depreciated on straight- line  basis over the lease period) and any accumulated  impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurement  of the lease liability specified in Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’.   The Company as a lessor     Leases under which the Company is a lessor are classified  as finance or operating leases. Lease contracts where  all the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to  the lessee, the lease contracts are classified as finance  leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases.  Lease payments from operating leases are recognised  as an income in the Statement of Profit and Loss on  a straight-line basis over the lease term or another  systematic basis if that basis is more representative  of the pattern in which benefit from the use of the  underlying asset is diminished. 222 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements 4.     Significant accounting judgements,  estimates and assumptions     The preparation of  fi nancial statements in conformity  with the Ind AS requires the management to make  judgements , estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets  and liabilities and the accompanying disclosure and the  disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the  reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to  accounting estimates are recognised in the period in  which the estimates are revised if the revision affects  only that period or in the period of the revision and  future periods if the revision affects both current and  future periods. Although these estimates are based on  the management’s best knowledge of current events  and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and  estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a  material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or  liabilities in future periods.     In particular, information about signi fi cant areas of  estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements  in  applying accounting policies that have the most  signi fi cant effect on the amounts recognized in the  fi nancial statements is included in the following notes: 4.1.   Business Model Assessment     Classification and measurement of financial assets  depends on the results of the Solely payments of  principal and interest and the business model test. The  Company determines the business model at a level that  reflects how groups of financial assets are managed  together to achieve a particular business objective. This  assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant  evidence including how the performance of the assets  is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks  that affect the performance of the assets and how these  are managed and how the managers of the assets are  compensated. The Company monitors financial assets  measured at amortised cost or fair value through other  comprehensive income that are derecognised prior  to their maturity to understand the reason for their  disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with  the objective of the business for which the asset was  held. Monitoring is part of the Company’s continuous  assessment of whether the business model for which  the remaining financial assets are held continues to be  appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has  been a change in business model and so a prospective  change to the classification of those assets. 4.2.   Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method     The Company’s EIR methodology, recognises interest  income using a rate of return that represents the best  estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected  behavioural life of loans given and recognises the effect  of potentially different interest rates at various stages and  other characteristics of the product life cycle (including  prepayments and penalty interest and charges).     This estimation, by nature, requires an element of  judgement regarding the expected behaviour and  life-cycle of the instruments, probable fluctuations in  collateral value as well as expected changes to India’s  base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral  parts of the instrument 4.3.   Impairment of loans portfolio     The measurement of impairment losses across all  categories of financial assets requires judgement, in  particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of  future cash flows and collateral values when determining  impairment losses and the assessment of a significant  increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by  a number of factors, changes in which can result in  different levels of allowances.     It has been the Company’s policy to regularly review  its models in the context of actual loss experience and  adjust when necessary. 4.4.    De fi ned employee bene fi t assets and  liabilities     The cost of the de fi ned bene fi t gratuity plan and the  present value of the gratuity obligation are determined  using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation  involves making various assumptions that may differ  from actual developments in the future. These include  Standalone  / Financial Statements 223 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of Financial Statements the determination of the discount rate, future salary  increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities  involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a  de fi ned bene fi t obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at  each reporting date. 4.5.   Fair value measurement     When the fair values of  fi nancial assets and  fi nancial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets,  their fair value is measured using various valuation  techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from  observable markets where possible, but where this is not  feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing  fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs  such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the  reported fair value of  fi nancial instruments. 4.6.   Determination of lease term     Ind AS 116 “Leases” requires lessee to determine the  lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease  adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the  lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The  Company makes assessment on the expected lease term  on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether  it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or  terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating  the lease term, the Company considers factors such  as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken  over the lease term, costs relating to the termination  of lease and the importance of the underlying to the  Company’s operations taking into account the location  of the underlying asset and the availability of the  suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods  is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the  current economic circumstances. 4.7.   Other estimates     These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of  tangible and intangible assets etc. 224 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

There are no changes from the previous period to the methods and assumptions underlying the sensitivity  analyses.  The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at March 31, 2025 is 5 years (2024: 5 years).The  estimates of future salary increases, considered in actuarial valuation, take account of in fl ation, seniority, promotion and other  relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. Description of Asset Liability Matching (ALM) Policy The Company primarily deploys its gratuity investment assets in insurer-offered debt market-linked plans. As investment returns  of the plan are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, the liability movement is broadly hedged by asset movement if the  duration is matched. Description of funding arrangements and funding policy that affect future contributions The liabilities of the fund are funded by assets. The Company aims to maintain a close to full-funding position at each Balance  Sheet date. Future expected contributions are disclosed based on this principle. The principal assumptions used in determining leave encashment obligations for the Company’s plans  are shown below: The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Government of India securities as at the balance sheet date for the  estimated term of the obligations. The estimate of future salary increases considered, takes into account the in fl ation, seniority,  promotion, increments, mortality, withdrawals  and other relevant factors.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of Financial Statements Valuation methodologies of financial instruments not measured at fair value Short-term financial assets and liabilities For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which  are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such instruments include cash and cash equivalents,  trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Loans and advances to customers The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit  risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since comparable data is not available, Credit risk is derived using  historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models. Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous  groups based on similar characteristics i.e., type of loan. The Company then calculates and extrapolates the fair value to the entire  portfolio using effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of  the loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability  of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss  allowance is of reasonable approximation of their fair value. Investments - at amortised cost For Government Securities,the market value of the respective Government stock as on the date of reporting has been considered  for fair value computations. Debt Securities The fair value of  debt securities and subordinated liabilities is estimated by a discounted cashflow model incorporating interest  rate estimates from market observable data such as secondary prices for its traded debt itself. Financial liabilities at amortised cost The fair values of financial liabilities held-to-maturity (financial liabilities other than trade payables, debt securities and subordinated  liablities) are estimated using effective interest rate  model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost  of borrowing on the reporting date is not expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective  interest rate model, the carrying value of such financial liabilities at amortised cost is considered a reasonable approximation of  their fair value.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of Financial Statements Note 42: Risk Management The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these  financial liabilities is to finance and support the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include loans,  investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that are derived directly from its operations. As a financial lending  institution, Company is exposed to various risks that are related to lending business and operating environment. The principal  objective in Company’s risk management processes is to measure and monitor the various risks that Company is subject to and to  follow policies and procedures to address such risks. The Company’s Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors constituted in accordance with the Reserve Bank of India  regulations has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Risk Management Policy. The committee meets at  least twice in a year to review the Risk Management practices. Risk Management department periodically places its report to the  committee for review. The committee’s suggestions for improving the Risk Management Practices are implemented by the Risk  Management department. Risk Management department shall be responsible for the following: a)    Identifying the various risks associated with the activities of the Company and assessing their impact on the business. b)    Measuring the risks and suggesting measures to effectively mitigate the risks. However, the primary responsibility for managing the various risks on a day to day basis will be with the heads of the respective  business units of the Company. The Company is generally exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk. I)    Credit Risk     Credit Risk arises from the risk of loss that may occur from the default of Company’s customers under loan agreements.  Customer defaults and inadequate collateral may lead to loan losses.   The Company addresses credit risk through following processes:   a)      Credit risk on Gold loan is considerably reduced as collateral is in the form of Gold ornaments which can be easily  liquidated and there is only a distant possibility of losses due to adequate margin of 25% or more retained while  disbursing the loan. Credit risk is further reduced through a quick but careful collateral appraisal and loan approval  process. Hence overall, the Credit risk is normally low.   b)      Sanctioning powers for Gold Loans is delegated to various authorities at branches/controlling offices. Sanctioning  powers are used only for granting loans for legally permitted purposes. The maximum Loan to Value does not exceed  the limit stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India under any circumstances.   c)      Gold ornaments brought for pledge is the primary responsibility of Branch Manager. Branch executives should enquire  with the customers about the ownership of the ornaments being pledged for loan and the loan should be granted only  after they are convinced about the genuineness of the customer and his capacity to own that much quantity of gold. In  addition to the above, customers are also required to sign a declaration of ownership of ornaments offered as security  for the loan. Extra care is taken if the gold jewellery brought for pledge by any customer at any one time or cumulatively  Standalone  / Financial Statements 281 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of Financial Statements is more than 20 gm. The declaration should also contain an explanation specifically as to how the ownership was vested  with the customer.   d)      Auctions are conducted as per the Auction Policy of the Company and the guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India.  In case of Gold Loans , generally auction of gold jewellery accepted as security is conducted if total dues on the loan is  not repaid by due date. After reasonable time is given to the customers for release after loan becomes overdue and on  exhausting all efforts for persuasive recovery, auction is resorted to as the last measure in unavoidable cases. Company  has the right to recover dues remaining evenafter set off of amount received on auctions from the customer. Any excess  amount received on auctions over and above the dues are refunded to the customer.   e)      In case of loans other than Gold Loan, loans are given whether with primary/collateral security, like secured loans  or without any primary/collateral security like unsecured loans, more than ordinary care is taken such that loans are  granted only to persons/firms/companies of repute with credit worthiness, future cash flows to repay the loan and  track record.   Impairment Assessment     The Company is mainly engaged in the business of providing gold loans. The tenure of the loans generally is for 12 months.  The Company also provides unsecured personal loans to salaried individuals and unsecured loans to traders and self  employed. The tenure of the loans ranges from 12 months to 60 months. The Company also provides loans to corporate  entities which are secured/unsecured for periods up to 3 years. The Company’s impairment assessment and measurement  approach is set out in this note.   Definition  of  default  and  cure               The Company considers a financial instrument as defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for Expected Credit  Loss (ECL) calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 91 days past due including the due date on its contractual  payments. As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of  instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event  should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations. It is the Company’s  policy to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 only when  none of the default  criteria have been present. Accordingly, revenue is recognized on financial instruments classified as Stage 3 when none of  the default criteria is present. The decision whether to classify an asset as Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends on the  updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in credit risk  compared to initial recognition.                  Company’s internal credit rating grades and staging criteria for loans are as follows: Rating  Loans Days  past due (DPD)  including    the due date Stages High grade Not yet due Stage 1 Standard grade 1-30 DPD Stage 1 Sub-standard grade 31-60 DPD Stage 2 Past due but not impaired 61- 90 DPD Stage 2 Individually impaired 91 DPD or More  Stage 3 Note 42: Risk Management (Contd.) 282 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of Financial Statements   Exposure at Default (EAD) The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure  after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise,  expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest.   Probability of Default (PD) The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. For Stage 1 financial assets,  the Company assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12 month ECL. For Stage  2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments. The  Company uses historical information wherever available to determine PD. PD is calculated using Incremental 91 DPD  approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. Where historical information is not available , the PD/ default rates as stated by external reporting agencies is considered. Where appropriate, the Company makes adjustments  to the PD estimate outside the Company’s regular modelling process to reflect management judgements . Changes to the  assumptions underlying these judgemental adjusments could materially affect ECL in next 12 months. Theses adjustments  include post-model adjustments and overlays.

The Company determines its recovery  (net present value) by analysing the recovery trends, borrower rating, collateral value and expected proceeds from sale of  asset/collateral. LGD Rates have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in defaulted accounts that  are closed/written off/repossessed and upgraded during the year. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group  of similar assets, the Company applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase  in credit risk since initial recognition. Company has adopted 65% as the LGD which is the rate drawn  reference from    Internal Rating Based (IRB) approach guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India for Banks to calculate LGD where sufficient  past information is not available. Where appropriate, the Company makes adjustments to the LGD estimate outside the  Company’s regular modelling process to reflect management judgements . Changes to the assumptions underlying these  judgemental adjusments could materially affect ECL in next 12 months. Theses adjustments include post-model adjustments  and overlays.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of Financial Statements Note 42: Risk Management (Contd.) III)    Market risk     Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest rates, credit,  liquidity, and other market changes. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings  and equity to loss and reduce our exposure to the volatility inherent in financial instruments. The Company is exposed to  four types of market risk as follows:   a)    Interest rate risk       Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in market interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk, primarily since it lends to customers  at fixed rates and for maturity periods shorter than the funding sources. Majority of our borrowings are at fixed  rates. However, borrowings at floating rates gives rise to interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many  factors beyond control, including the monetary policies of the Reserve Bank of India, domestic and international  economic and political conditions, inflation and other factors. In order to manage interest rate risk, the Company seek  to optimize borrowing profile between short-term and long-term loans. The Company adopts funding strategies to  ensure diversified resource-raising options to minimize cost and maximize stability of funds. Assets and liabilities are  categorized into various time buckets based on their maturities and Asset Liability Management Committee supervise  an interest rate sensitivity report periodically for assessment of interest rate risks. The Interest Rate Risk is mitigated by  availing funds at very competitive rates through diversified borrowings and for different tenors.       During the year, Company has undertaken derivative transactions for hedging interest rate risk on certain domestic  currency exposures linked to external benchmark through Interest Rate Swaps as below: Particulars As at    March 31, 2025 As at    March 31, 2024 Domestic Currency Exposure  17,791.67   13,000.00  The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion  of borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on  floating rate borrowings are as follows: Impact on Profit before taxes As at    March 31, 2025 As at    March 31, 2024 On Floating Rate Borrowings 1% increase in interest rates 4,226.51  3,490.33  1% decrease in interest rates  (4,226.51)  (3,490.33)   b)    Price risk Sudden fall in the gold price and fall in the value of the pledged gold ornaments can result in some of the customers  to default if the loan amount and interest exceeds the market value of gold. This risk is in part mitigated by a minimum  25% margin retained on the value of gold jewellery for the purpose of calculation of the loan amount. Further, we  appraise the gold jewellery collateral solely based on the weight of its gold content, excluding weight and value of the  stone studded in the jewellery. In addition, the sentimental value of the gold jewellery to the customers may induce  repayment and redemption of the collateral even if the value of gold ornaments falls below the value of the repayment  amount. An occasional decrease in gold prices will not increase price risk significantly on account of our adequate  collateral security margins. However, a sustained decrease in the market price of gold can additionally cause a decrease  in the size of our loan portfolio and our interest income.

Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decrease as the result of changes in level of equity indices and  individual stocks.  The trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVTPL and the non- trading equity price risk  exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVOCI. A 10% increase/(decrease) in the  equity price ( traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows: Particulars Increase/ (Decrease) in  percentage Sensitivity of  profit or loss Sensitivity  of Other  Comprehensive  Income As at March 31, 2025 10/(10) 14.31/(14.31) 220.27/(220.27) As at March 31, 2024 10/(10) 23.24/(23.24) 225.16/(225.16)   c)    Foreign currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  Foreign currency risk for the Company arises majorly on account of foreign currency borrowings. The Company’s  foreign currency exposures are managed in accordance with its Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy which has  been approved by its Board of Directors. The Company has hedged its foreign currency risk on its foreign currency  borrowings as on March 31, 2025 by entering into  forward contracts with the intention of covering the entire term of  foreign currency exposure. The counterparties for such hedge transactions are banks. The Company’s exposure on account of Foreign Currency Borrowings at the end of the reporting period expressed in  Indian Rupees are as follows: Particulars Foreign currency As at    March 31, 2025 As at    March 31, 2024 FCNB Demand Loan (principal amount on reporting date) USD -  3,902.57  External Commercial Borrowings - Senior Secured Notes (principal  amount and interest accrued but not due on reporting date) USD  121,815.81   -    Since the foreign currency exposure is completely hedged by equivalent derivative instrument, there will not be any  significant impact on sensitivity analysis due to the possible change in the exchange rates where all other variables are  held constant. On the date of maturity of the derivative instrument, considering the hedging for the entire term of the  foreign currency exposure, the sensitivity of profit and loss to changes in the exchange rates will be Nil.   d)    Prepayment risk Prepayment risk is the risk that the Company will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay  or request repayment earlier  than expected, such as fixed rate loans when interest rates fall. IV)    Operational and business risk Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail  to operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead  to financial loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks  through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation  of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes including the use  of internal audit. 292 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

Where  impairment allowance under Ind AS 109 is lower than the provisioning required under IRACP (including standard asset provisioning),  NBFCs shall appropriate the difference from their net profit or loss after tax to a separate ‘Impairment Reserve’. The balance in  the ‘Impairment Reserve’ shall not be reckoned for regulatory capital. Further, no withdrawals shall be permitted from this reserve  without prior permission from the Department of Supervision of the Reserve Bank. A comparison between provisions required  under IRACP and impairment allowances made under Ind AS 109 is given below: Template for Disclosure in Notes to Financial Statements Asset Classification as per RBI Norms Asset  classification as  per Ind AS 109  Gross Carrying  Amount as per  Ind AS  Loss  Allowances  (Provisions) as  required under  Ind AS 109 Net Carrying  Amount Provisions  required as per  IRACP norms Difference  between  Ind AS 109  provisions and  IRACP norms (1) (2)  (3)  (4) (5)=(3)-(4) (6) (7)=(4)-(6) Performing Assets Standard Stage 1  1,060,902.91   8,738.28   1,052,164.63   4,048.69   4,689.59  Stage 2  5,971.50   355.38   5,616.12   17.00   338.38  Subtotal  1,066,874.41   9,093.66   1,057,780.75   4,065.69   5,027.97  Non-Performing Assets (NPA) Substandard Stage 3  28,198.20   5,703.42   22,494.78   5,753.33   (49.91) Doubtful - up to 1 year Stage 3  7,403.59   775.24   6,628.35   2,093.36   (1,318.12) 1 to 3 years Stage 3  1,217.05   121.02   1,096.03   598.21   (477.19) More than 3 years Stage 3  184.86   37.44   147.42   112.92   (75.48) Subtotal for doubtful  8,805.50   933.70   7,871.80   2,804.49   (1,870.79) Note 52: Other disclosures required as per Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking  Financial Company – Scale Based Regulation) Directions, 2023 and Master Direction – Reserve Bank  of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021 (Contd.) 318 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of Financial Statements Note: 1.    Unweighted values are calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for Cash inflows and Cash outflows). 2.    Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective haircuts (for HQLA) and stress factors (on cash inflow/cash outflow) as per  RBI guidelines. 3.   ‘Average’ for all the quarters is computed as simple averages of daily observations for the quarter. 4.    The figures used for the quantitative disclosure are based on the estimates and assumptions of the management, which have been relied upon  by the auditors. B)    Qualitative disclosure     The Company has adopted Liquidity Risk Management (LRM) framework on liquidity standards as prescribed by the RBI  guidelines and has put in place requisite systems and processes to enable periodical computation and reporting of the Liquidity  Coverage Ratio (LCR). The mandated regulatory threshold is embedded into the Liquidity Risk Management framework of  the Company thus subjecting LCR maintenance to Board oversight and periodical review. The Company computes the LCR  and reports the same to the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) as well as to the ALM Committee of the Board.   The Company follows the criteria laid down by RBI for calculation of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), gross cash outflows  and inflows within the next 30-day period. HQLA predominantly comprises unencumbered Cash and Bank balances,  Government securities (viz., Treasury Bills, Central and State Government securities, Investments in TREPs (Triparty Repo  trades in Government Securities provided by The Clearing Corporation of India)).     All significant outflows and inflows determined in accordance with RBI guidelines are included in the prescribed LCR  computation template.     The Company monitors the concentration of funding sources from significant counterparties, significant instruments/ products as part of the LRM framework. The Company follows internal limits on short-term borrowings which form part of  the LRM framework. The Company’s funding sources are fairly dispersed across sources and maturities.     The Board shall have the overall responsibility for management of liquidity risk. The Board shall decide the strategy, policies  and procedures to manage liquidity risk in accordance with the liquidity risk tolerance/limits decided by it from time to time.   The ALM Committee of the Board of Directors shall be responsible for evaluating the liquidity risk.     The Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO) consisting of the NBFC’s top management shall be responsible for  ensuring adherence to the risk tolerance/limits set by the Board as well as implementing the liquidity risk management  strategy of the NBFC. The Managing Director heads the Committee. The role of the ALCO with respect to liquidity risk  include, inter alia, decision on desired maturity profile and mix of incremental assets and liabilities, sale of assets as a source  of funding, the structure, responsibilities and controls for managing liquidity risk, and overseeing the liquidity positions of  the Company.     The ALM Support Group headed by Chief Financial Officer and consisting of operating staff will be responsible for analysing,  monitoring and reporting the liquidity risk profile to the ALCO.

Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of  Muthoot Finance Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial  Statements of Muthoot Finance Limited (“the Holding  Company”) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and  its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which  comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025,  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss including Other  Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes  In Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for  the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated Financial  Statements, including a summary of material accounting  policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred  to as the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, and based on  the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate  financial statements of such subsidiaries, as were audited by  the other auditors, referred to in the Other Matters paragraph  below, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give  the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the  Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view  in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed  under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (‘Ind AS’) and  other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the  consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025,  and its consolidated profits, consolidated total comprehensive  income, consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated  cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial  statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs)  specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities  under those Standards are further described in the “Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements” section of our report. We are independent of  the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’) together  with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of  the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of  the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled  our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit  evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by  the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the  other matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated  financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the current year. These  matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming  our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters. We have determined the matters described  below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in  our report. 326 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

A)   Key Audit Matters with reference to the Holding Company Key Audit Matters How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matters 1.     Allowances for expected credit losses (‘ECL’):     The Company recognises expected credit losses (ECL) on  its loan assets in accordance with Ind AS 109, Financial  Instruments, using the expected credit loss model.  Significant judgement is used in classifying these loan assets  and applying appropriate measurement principles. ECL  on such loan assets carried at amortised cost is a critical  estimate involving greater level of Management judgement.  As part of our risk assessment, we determined that the  ECL on such loan assets has a high degree of estimation  uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes  for the consolidated financial statements. The elements of  estimating ECL which involved increased level of audit focus  are the following: •   Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the  loan assets carried at amortised cost; •   Basis used for estimating probabilities of default (‘PD’),  loss given default (‘LGD’) and exposure at default (‘EAD’)  at product level with past trends; •   Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios and  probability weights applied to reflect future economic  conditions; and •   Adjustments to model driven ECL results to address  emerging trends. (Refer note no. 8 and 44 to the consolidated financial statements). We have examined the policies approved by the Board of Directors of  the Company that articulate the objectives of managing each portfolio  and their business models. We have   also   checked   the   methodology   adopted   for computation of the ECL Model, including the policies  approved by the Board of Directors, procedures, and controls for  assessing and measuring credit risk on all lending exposures carried  at amortised cost, and its compliance with Ind AS 109. Additionally,  we have confirmed that adjustments to the output of the ECL Model  are consistent with the documented rationale and basis for such  adjustments and that the amount of adjustments have been approved  by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our audit procedures  related to the allowance for ECL included the following, among others: Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the following: •   Completeness and accuracy of the EAD and the classification thereof  into stages consistent with the definitions applied in accordance  with the policy approved by the Board of Directors including the  appropriateness of the qualitative factors to be applied; •   Completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of information used in  the estimation of the PD and LGD for the different stages depending  on the nature of the portfolio; •   Accuracy of the computation of the ECL estimate including  reasonableness of the methodology used to determine macro- economic overlays and adjustments to the output of the ECL  model; and  Test of details on a sample basis in respect of the following: •   Accuracy and completeness of the input data such as period of  default and other related information used in estimating the PD; •   The mathematical accuracy of the ECL computation by using the  same input data as used by the Company. •   Completeness and accuracy of the staging of the loans and  the underlying data based on which the ECL estimates have  been computed. •   Evaluating the adequacy of the adjustment after stressing the inputs  used in determining the output as per the ECL model to ensure  that the adjustment was in conformity with the overlay amount  approved by the Audit Committee of the Company. 2.   Information technology and general controls:     The Company relies heavily on its information technology (IT)  systems due to the high volume of transactions processed  daily across multiple, discrete platforms. Effective IT  application controls are essential to ensure that any changes  to applications and the underlying data are implemented  appropriately and within a controlled environment. These  controls play a vital role in mitigating the risk of errors or  potential fraud arising from unauthorized or inappropriate  changes. Given the pervasive use of IT systems in the  Company’s financial reporting processes, the evaluation and  testing of general IT controls were considered a key audit  matter. We obtained an understanding of the Company’s IT applications,  databases and operating systems relevant to financial reporting.  Our focus areas within the IT infrastructure included access security,  program change controls, database management, and network  operations. Specifically: •   We tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness  of the Company’s general IT controls over systems relevant to  financial reporting. This included an assessment of controls related  to segregation of duties and the provisioning or modification of  access rights based on appropriately authorized requests. •   We also evaluated key automated business process controls and the  logic of system-generated reports that were relevant to financial  reporting or were used in the operation of internal financial  controls over the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we  performed alternate procedures to assess whether any unmitigated  IT risks existed that could materially impact the consolidated  financial statements.

Key Audit Matters How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matters 3.   Related Party Transactions:     We  identified related party transactions as a key audit  matter due to their financial and regulatory significance, the  complexity involved in their identification and approval, and  the inherent risk of non-disclosure or misstatement in the  financial statements. •   We obtained an understanding of the Company’s policies  for identifying and disclosing related party relationships  and transactions. •   We inspected minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and  the Audit Committee to assess whether related party transactions  were deliberated, reviewed, and approved in line with regulatory  and governance requirements. •   On a sample basis, we tested related party transactions by examining  underlying agreements, approvals, and supporting documentation  to evaluate whether the transactions were appropriately recorded,  disclosed, and conducted in the ordinary course of business and at  arm’s length. •   We assessed compliance with Sections 177 and 188 of the  Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI (LODR) Regulations—with respect  to authorisation, approvals, disclosures, and required reporting. •   We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of related party  disclosures in the financial statements in accordance with Ind AS 24. B)   Key Audit Matters with reference to subsidiaries     There are no specific key audit matters reported to us by the auditors of the subsidiary companies not audited by us, except  as reported by the auditors of two subsidiary companies in their standalone audit report and reproduced by us, as below:   (i)    In respect of the subsidiary, Belstar Microfinance Limited.     The auditor of Belstar Microfinance Limited has included the following Key Audit Matter in the audit report: Key Audit Matters How the matter was addressed in the audit 1.     Assessment of impairment loss allowance  based on expected credit loss (ECL) on Loans     Under Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments, credit loss  assessment is based on expected credit loss (ECL) model.  The Company’s impairment allowance is derived from  estimates including the historical default and loss ratios.  Management exercises judgement in determining the  quantum of loss based on a range of factors.     The determination of impairment loss allowance is  inherently judgmental and relies on managements’ best  estimate due to the following:     Segmentation of loans given to the customer. Criteria  selected to identify significant increase in credit risk.     Increased level of data inputs for capturing the historical  data to calculate the Probability of Default (‘PDs’) and  Loss Given Default (“LGD”) and the completeness and  accuracy of that data.     Use of management judgement for considering the  forward looking macro-economic factors economic  environment and timing of cash flows.     The underlying forecasts and assumptions used in the  estimates of impairment loss allowance are subject to  uncertainties which are often outside the control of the  Company.     Given the size of loan portfolio relative to the balance  sheet and the impact of impairment loss allowance on  the financial statements, we have considered this as a  key audit matter. The audit procedures performed by us to assess the appropriateness  of the impairment allowance based on ECL on loans included the  following: We understood and evaluated the design and tested the operating  effectiveness of the key controls put in place by the management over  the assumptions used in the calculation of ECL and its various aspects  such as determination of Probability of Default, Loss Given Default,  Exposure at Default, Staging of Loans, etc.; ii.     the completeness and accuracy of source data used by the  Management in the ECL computation; and ECL computations for  their reasonableness. We verified the appropriateness of methodology and models used by  the Company and reasonableness of the assumptions used within the  computation process to estimate the impairment provision. We test-checked the completeness and accuracy of source data used. We recomputed the impairment provision for a sample of loans across  the loan portfolio to verify the arithmetical accuracy and compliance  with the requirements of Ind AS 109. We evaluated the reasonableness of the judgement involved in  management overlays that form part of the impairment provision, and  the related approvals. We evaluated the adequacy of presentation and disclosures in relation  to impairment loss allowance in the financial statements Marco  economic adjustment in Co- lending. 328 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

  (i)    In respect of the subsidiary, Belstar Microfinance Limited.   (ii)   The auditor of Muthoot Homefin (India) Limited has included the following Key Audit Matter in the audit report: Key Audit Matters How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matters 1.     Impairment of Financial Instruments as per Ind AS  109 Our audit approach/procedures included the following: •     Read and assessed the Company’s accounting policies for  impairment of financial assets and their compliance with Ind  AS 109 •     Performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the  key systems, and manual controls used in the Computation of  ECL. •     Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the key  controls over the application of the staging criteria. •     Testing key controls relating to selection and implementation    of material macro-economic variables and the controls over  the scenario selection and application of probability weights. •     Evaluated the reasonableness of the methodology and tools  to compute ECL rates. •     Performed test of details over calculations of ECL rate  computation, in relation to the completeness and accuracy of  data on sample basis. •     Obtained written representations from the management on  the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in  computation of ECL provision. •     Assessing management overlays to calibrate the risks that are  not yet fully captured by existing model. •     Assessed the disclosures included in the Ind-AS financial  statements with respect to such allowance / estimate are in  accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 109 and Ind AS  107 Financial Instruments Disclosures.     Ind AS 109 Financial instruments (Ind AS 109) requires the  Company to provide for impairment of its financial instruments  (designated as amortized cost or fair value through other  comprehensive income) using the expected credit loss (ECL)  approach.     ECL involves an estimation and a significant degree of  judgement by the management for development of ECL  model and its corresponding application in the ECL model.  These judgement and estimates include:   1.     Data inputs – The application of ECL model requires  several data inputs. This increases the risk of completeness  and accuracy of the data that has been used to create  assumptions in the model.   2.    Model estimations – Inherently, judgemental models  are used to estimate ECL which involves determining  Probabilities of Default (‘PD”), Loss Given Default (“LGD”)  and Exposures at Default (“EAD”). The PD and the LGD  are key drivers of estimation complexity in the ECL and as  a result are considered the most significant judgemental  aspect of the Company’s modelling approach.   3.     Economic scenarios – Ind AS 109 requires the Company to  measure ECLs on an unbiased forward looking reflecting  a range of future economic conditions. Significant  management judgement is applied in determining the  economic scenarios used and the probability weights  applied to them.     4.     The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk  assessment, we determined that the impairment of loans  and advances to customers, including off balance sheet  elements, has a high degree of estimation uncertainty,  with a potential range of reasonable outcome greater  than our materiality for the financial statements as a  whole. Management overlay based on risk assessment.   Disclosures:     The disclosures regarding the Company’s application of Ind  AS 109 are key to explaining the key judgements and material  inputs to the Ind AS 109 ECL results. Further, disclosures to  be provided as per the RBI circulars with regards to non- performing assets and provisions will also be an area of focus.

Key Audit Matters How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matters 2.   Evaluation of Company’s Information Technology Audit approach/procedures carried out by us including our IT  Specialist are as under: •     Evaluated the extent to which the controls are designed and  implemented to mitigate the risk of material misstatement  in financial reporting. •     Obtained an understanding of the IT control environment  and IT policies during the audit period. •     Obtained an understanding of the Company’s information  processing systems, IT General Controls and automated IT  controls for select applications and databases relevant to  our audit. •     Testing IT general controls related to User access  management, Change Management Controls, Information  Security Controls, Log management and Data backup. •     Assessment and identification of key IT applications  including those identified by the management for audit  trail (audit log) further verifying, testing, and reviewing the  design and operating effectiveness of the IT system based  on reports and other financial and non- financial information  generated from the system on a test check basis.   (IT) systems and Controls over Financial Reporting     The information system is a critical component of Company’s  operations, enabling efficient processing of transactions,  safeguarding of information, and supporting decision- making. The Company uses Emnest Application for managing  its loan transactions and also for overall financial reporting.     As such, it is important for us to evaluate the effectiveness  of information system controls to ensure the correctness,  integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data. We identified  ‘IT systems and controls including audit trail (audit log)’ as key  audit matter because of the pervasive nature of IT environment  and the scale and complexity of the IT architecture. Information other than the Consolidated  Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report  thereon The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the other information. The other information  comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but  does not include the consolidated financial statements and our  auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be  made available to us after that date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not  cover the other information and we do not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information,  compare with the financial statements of the subsidiaries  audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates to these  entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the  other auditors and consider whether the other information  is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial  statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a  material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate  the matter to those charged with governance as required  under SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to Other  Information’. Responsibility of Management and Board  of Directors’ for the consolidated financial  statements The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors is  responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act  with respect to the preparation of these consolidated financial  statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated  financial position, consolidated financial performance including  other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity  and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with  the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including  the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act read with  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,  as amended. The respective Management and the Board  of Directors of the companies included in the Group are  responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records  in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding  of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting  frauds and other irregularities; selection and application  of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and  estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated  financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,  which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the  consolidated financial statements by the Management and the  Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. 330 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the  respective Management and the Board of Directors of the  companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing  the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going  concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going  concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless the respective Management and the Board of Directors  either intends to liquidate their respective entities or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Management and the Board of Directors of  the companies included in the Group are also responsible for  overseeing the financial reporting process of the respective  companies in the Group. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they  could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated  financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism  throughout the audit. We also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud  or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The  risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls  relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section  143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing  our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness  of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by management. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of  the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty  exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are  required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements  or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up  to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as  a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the consolidated financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and events  in a manner that achieves fair presentation. •   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the  financial information of the entities or business activities  within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated  financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audit of the financial  statements of such entities included in the consolidated  financial statements of which we are the independent  auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated  financial statements, which have been audited by other  auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the  direction, supervision and performance of the audits  carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our  audit opinion. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the  consolidated financial statements that, individually or in  aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of  a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial  statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative  materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of  our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and  Consolidated  / Financial Statements 331 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

(ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the  consolidated financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance of  the Holding Company regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit  findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal  control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and  where applicable, related safeguards From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of  most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial  statements of the current period and are therefore the key  audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s  report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure  about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,  we determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our report because the adverse consequences of doing so  would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication.

These financial  statements are unaudited and have been furnished to us  by the Management and our opinion on the Consolidated  Financial Statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts  and disclosures included in respect of this subsidiary, and  our report under section 143(3) of the Act in so far as  it relates to the aforesaid subsidiary, is based solely on  such unaudited financial statements. In our opinion and  according to the information and explanations given to us  by the Management, these financial statements are not  material to the Group.

Annexure A to the Independent Auditors’ Report (Referred to in Paragraph 2(g) under the heading “Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements”  of our report of even date) Independent Auditor’s Report on the Internal financial  controls with reference to the consolidated financial  statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section  143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements of the Muthoot Finance Limited as of and for the  year ended March 31, 2025, we have audited the internal  financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial  statements of Muthoot Finance Limited (hereinafter referred  to as “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary companies  incorporated in India, as of that date. Managements and Board of Directors’  Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Management and Board of Directors of the  Holding Company and its subsidiary companies incorporated in  India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal  financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial  statements based on the internal control criteria established by  the respective Companies considering the essential components  of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the  ICAI. These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the  respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under  the Companies Act, 2013. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements of the Holding Company, and its subsidiaries,  which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note  issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed  under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the  extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements was established and maintained and if  such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  with reference to consolidated financial statements and their  operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls  with reference to consolidated financial statements included  obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the  risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on  the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks  of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether  due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and  the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the  subsidiaries, which are companies incorporated in India, in  terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference  to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company,  and its subsidiaries, which are companies incorporated in India. Meaning of Internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements is a process designed to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial statements  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately  and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the  assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of the company are being made only in accordance with  authorizations of management and Directors of the company;  and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition  336 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to consolidated financial statements, including  the possibility of collusion or improper management override  of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may  occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that  the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements may become inadequate because of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with  the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to  the explanations given to us and based on the consideration  of the reports of the other auditors referred to in the other  matters paragraph below, the Holding Company and its  subsidiaries, which are companies incorporated in India, have,  in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls  with reference to consolidated financial statements and such  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31,  2025, based on the internal financial controls with reference  to consolidated financial statements criteria established by the  respective companies considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Other Matter Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the  adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial statements  in so far as it relates to six subsidiary companies, which are  companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding  reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India. Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matter.

Statement of Compliance     These consolidated financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)  notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013  read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, (as amended from time to time).These financial  statements may require further adjustments, if any,  necessitated by the guidelines / clarifications / directions  issued in the future by RBI, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, or  other regulators, which will be implemented as and when  the same are issued and made applicable. 344 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements 2.2.   Principles of Consolidation   2.2.1. Business Combination:       The Group applies Ind AS 103, Business  Combinations, to business combinations. In  accordance with Ind AS 103, the Group accounts for  these business combinations using the acquisition  method when control is transferred to the Group.  The consideration transferred for the business  combination is generally measured at fair value as at  the date the control is acquired (acquisition date), as  are the net identifiable assets acquired. Any goodwill  that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any  gain on bargain purchase is recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated in  equity as capital reserve if there exist clear evidence  of the underlying reason for classifying the business  combination as resulting in bargain purchase;  otherwise the gain is recognised directly in equity  as capital reserve. Transaction cost are expensed  as incurred, except to the extent related to debt or  equity securities.       The consideration transferred does not include  amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing  relationships with the acquiree. Such amounts are  generally recognised in the statement of profit  and loss.       Any contingent consideration is measured at fair  value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation  to pay contingent consideration that meets the  definition of a financial instrument is classified as  equity, then it is not remeasured subsequently and  settlement is accounted for within equity. Other  contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value  at each reporting date and changes in the fair value  of the contingent consideration are recognised in  the statement of profit and loss.       If business combination is achieved in stages, any  previously held equity interest of the acquirer in the  acquiree is remeasured to its acquisition date fair  value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss or OCI,  as appropriate.   2.2.2. Subsidiaries       Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to,  or has right to, variable returns from its involvement  with the entity and has the ability to affect those  returns through its power over the entity. The  financial statements of subsidiaries are included  in the consolidated financial statements from the  date on which control commences until the date on  which control ceases.   2.2.3. Non-controlling interests (NCI)       NCI are measured at their proportionate share of  the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the date of  acquisition. Changes in the Group’s equity interest  in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control  are accounted for as equity transactions.   2.2.4. Loss of control       When the Group loses control over a subsidiary,  it derecognises the assets and liabilities of  the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other  component of equity. Any interest retained in the  former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the  date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   2.2.5. Transactions eliminated on consolidation       Intra group balances and transactions, and any  unrealised income and expenses arising from intra  group transactions are eliminated.   2.2.6. Foreign operations       The assets and liabilities of foreign operations,  including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising  on acquisition, are translated into at the exchange  rates at the reporting date. The income and  expenses of foreign operations are translated into at  the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.       The Group recognises foreign currency translation  differences in OCI and accumulated in equity (as  exchange difference on translating the financial  statements of foreign operations), except to the  345 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements extent that the exchange differences are allocated  to NCI.       When a foreign operation is disposed off in its  entirety or partially such that control or significant  influence is lost, the cumulative amount in the  translation reserve related to that foreign operation  is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss as  part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group  disposes off part of its interest in a subsidiary but  retains control, then the relevant proportion of the  cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI.   2.2.7.     The financial statement of the subsidiary companies  used in the consolidation are drawn up to the same  reporting date as that of the Company i.e., year  ended March 31, 2025.   2.2.8.    Consolidated financial statements are prepared  using uniform accounting policies except as stated  in Notes 3.9 and 3.10 of Consolidated Financial  Statements. The adjustments arising out of the  same are not considered material. 2.3.   Basis of measurement     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  on a historical cost basis, except for following assets and  liabilities which have been measured at fair value:   i)     fair value through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI) instruments,   ii)   derivative financial instruments,   iii)   other financial assets held for trading   iv)     financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value  through profit or loss (FVTPL) 2.4.     The financial statements of the Group are presented as  per Schedule III (Division III) of the Companies Act, 2013  applicable to NBFCs, as notified by the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs (MCA). Financial assets and financial liabilities are  generally reported on a gross basis except when, there  is an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset the  recognised amounts without being contingent on a future  event and the parties intend to settle on a net basis. 2.5.   Functional and presentation currency     The consolidated financial statements are presented in  Indian Rupees (INR) which is also its functional currency  and all values are rounded to the nearest million, except  when otherwise indicated. 2.6.    New Accounting Standards that are issued but  not effective     There are no standards that are issued but not yet effective  on March 31, 2025. 3.   Material accounting policies 3.1.   Revenue Recognition   3.1.1. Recognition of interest income       The Group recognises Interest income by applying  the effective interest rate (EIR) to the gross carrying  amount of a financial asset except for purchased or  originated credit-impaired financial assets and other  credit-impaired financial assets.       For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial  assets, the Group applies the credit-adjusted  effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the  financial asset from initial recognition.       For other credit-impaired financial assets, the Group  applies effective interest rate to the amortised cost of  the financial asset in subsequent reporting periods.       The effective interest rate on a financial asset is the  rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash  receipts through the expected life of the financial  asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial  asset. While estimating future cash receipts, factors  like expected behaviour and life cycle of the financial  asset, probable fluctuation in collateral value etc are  considered which has an impact on the EIR.       While calculating the effective interest rate, the  Group includes all fees and points paid or received  to and from the borrowers that are an integral part  of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and  all other premiums or discounts. 346 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements       Interest income on all trading assets and financial  assets required to be measured at FVTPL is recognised  using the contractual interest rate as net gain on fair  value changes.   3.1.2.    Recognition of revenue from sale of goods or  services       Revenue (other than for Financial Instruments within  the scope of Ind AS 109) is measured at an amount  that reflects the considerations, to which an entity  expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring  goods or services to customer, excluding amounts  collected on behalf of third parties.       The Group recognises revenue from contracts with  customers based on a five-step model as set out in  Ind AS 115:       Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A  contract is defined as an agreement between two  or more parties that creates enforceable rights and  obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract  that must be met.       Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the  contract: A performance obligation is a promise in  a contract with a customer to transfer a good or  service to the customer.         Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The  transaction price is the amount of consideration to  which the respective company expects to be entitled  in exchange for transferring promised goods or  services to a customer, excluding amounts collected  on behalf of third parties.       Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the  performance obligations in the contract: For a  contract that has more than one performance  obligation, the respective company allocates the  transaction price to each performance obligation in  an amount that depicts the amount of consideration  to which the company expects to be entitled in  exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.       Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the respective  company satisfies a performance obligation.       Revenue from contract with customer for rendering  services is recognised at a point in time when the  performance obligation is satisfied.   3.1.3. Recognition of Dividend Income       Dividend income (including from FVOCI investments)  is recognised by the Group when the respective  Company’s right to receive the payment is  established. This is established when it is probable  that the economic benefits associated with the  dividend will flow to the entity and the amount of  the dividend can be measured reliably.   3.1.4 Net gain/loss on fair value changes       The Company designates certain financial assets  for subsequent measurement at fair value through  profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Company  recognises gains/loss on fair value change of  financial assets measured at FVTPL and realised  gains on derecognition of financial asset measured  at FVTPL and FVOCI on net basis. In cases there is  a net gain in the aggregate, the same is recognised  in ‘Net gains on fair value changes’ under Revenue  from operations and if there is a net loss the same is  disclosed under ‘Expenses’ in the Statement of Profit  and Loss. 3.2.   Financial instruments   A.   Financial Assets     3.2.1. Initial recognition and measurement         All financial assets are recognised initially at fair  value when the Group become party to the  contractual provisions of the financial asset. In  case of financial assets which are not recorded  at fair value through profit or loss, transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the  acquisition or issue of the financial assets, are  adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition.     3.2.2. Subsequent measurement         The Companies in the Group classify its  financial assets into various measurement  347 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements categories. The classification depends on the  contractual terms of the financial assets’ cash  flows and the respective company’s business  model for managing financial assets.       a.    Financial assets measured at  amortised cost           A financial asset is measured at Amortised  Cost if it is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold the asset in  order to collect contractual cash flows  and the contractual terms of the Financial  Asset give rise on specified dates to  cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding.       b.    Financial assets measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income  (FVOCI)           A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if  it is held within a business model whose  objective is achieved by both collecting  contractual cash flows and selling financial  assets and contractual terms of financial  asset give rise on specified dates to  cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding.       c.     Financial assets measured at fair value  through profit or loss (FVTPL)           A financial asset which is not classified in  any of the above categories are measured  at FVTPL.     3.2.3. Other Equity Investments         All other equity investments are measured at  fair value, with value changes recognised in  Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those  equity investments for which the Group has  elected to present the changes in fair value  through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)   B.   Financial liabilities     3.2.4. Initial recognition and measurement         All financial liabilities are recognized initially  at fair value when the company become  party to the contractual provisions of the  financial liability. In case of financial liability  which are not recorded at fair value through  profit or loss, transaction cost that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of the  financial liability are adjusted to the fair value  on initial recognition. The Group’s financial  liabilities include trade and other payables,  Non-Convertible Debentures loans and  borrowings including bank overdrafts.     3.2.5. Subsequent Measurement         Financial liabilities other than financial liabilities  at fair value through profit or loss which  includes derivative financial instruments are  subsequently carried at amortized cost using  the effective interest method. Subsequent  measurement of derivative financial  instruments are at fair value as detailed under  Note 3.7 ‘Derivative Financial Instruments’. 3.3.   Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities   3.3.1. Financial Asset       The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset  expire or it transfers its contractual rights to receive  cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction  in which substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership are transferred. On derecognition of a  financial asset in its entirety, the difference between:  (a) the carrying amount (measured at the date of  derecognition) and (b) the consideration received  (including any new asset obtained less any new  liability assumed) shall be recognised in profit or  loss. Any rights and obligations created or retained  in the transfer of such financial assets by the Group  is recognized as a separate asset or liability. 348 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements       An entity has transferred the financial asset if, and  only if, either:     a)     it has transferred its contractual rights to receive  cash flows from the financial asset or     b)     It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has  assumed an obligation to pay the received cash  flows in full without material delay to a third  party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement       Pass-through arrangements are transactions  whereby the respective Company retains the  contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a  financial asset (the ‘original asset’), but assumes a  contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to  one or more entities (the ‘eventual recipients’), on  satisfying specific conditions.   3.3.2. Financial Liability       A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled  or expires. Where an existing financial liability  is replaced by another from the same lender  on substantially different terms, or the terms of  an existing liability are substantially modified,  such an exchange or modification is treated as  de-recognition of the original liability and the  recognition of a new liability. The difference  between the carrying value of the original financial  liability and the consideration paid is recognised in  the Statement of profit and loss. 3.4.   Offsetting     Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally  reported gross in the balance sheet. Financial assets and  liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the  balance sheet when the Group has a legal right to offset  the amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to  realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all  the following circumstances:   a.   The normal course of business   b.   The event of default   c.     The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group  and/or its counterparties 3.5.   Impairment of financial assets     In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group uses ‘Expected  Credit Loss’ model (ECL), for evaluating impairment of  financial assets other than those measured at Fair value  through profit or loss. The Group follows simplified  approach for recognition of impaired loss allowance on:   a)      Trade Receivables or contract revenue receivables; and   b)      All lease receivables resulting from transactions within  the scope of Ind AS 116.   3.5.1.    Overview of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model       Expected Credit Loss, at each reporting date,  is measured through a loss allowance for a  financial asset: •   At an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit  losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument  has increased significantly since initial recognition. •   At an amount equal to 12-month expected credit  losses, if the credit risk on a financial instrument has  not increased significantly since initial recognition.       Lifetime expected credit losses means expected  credit losses that result from all possible default  events over the expected life of a financial asset.       12-month expected credit losses means the  portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs  that result from default events on financial assets  that are possible within the 12 months after the  reporting date.       The Group performs an assessment, at the end  of each reporting period, of whether a financial  asset’s credit risk has increased significantly since  initial recognition. When making the assessment,  the change in the risk of a default occurring over  the expected life of the financial instrument is used  instead of the change in the amount of expected  credit losses. 349 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements       Based on the above process, the Group categorises  its loans into three stages as described below: •   Stage 1 is comprised of all non-impaired financial  assets which have not experienced a significant  increase in credit risk since initial recognition.  A 12-month ECL provision is made for stage 1  financial assets. In assessing whether credit risk  has increased significantly, The Companies in the  Group compares the risk of a default occurring on  the financial asset as at the reporting date with  the risk of a default occurring on the financial  asset as at the date of initial recognition. •   Stage 2 is comprised of all non-impaired financial  assets which have experienced a significant  increase in credit risk since initial recognition.  The Companies in the Group recognises lifetime  ECL for stage 2 financial assets. In subsequent  reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial  instrument improves such that there is no  longer a significant increase in credit risk since  initial recognition, then entities shall revert to  recognizing 12 months ECL provision. •   Financial assets are classified as Stage 3 when  there is objective evidence of impairment as  a result of one or more loss events that have  occurred after initial recognition with a negative  impact on the estimated future cash flows of a  loan or a portfolio of loans. The Group recognises  lifetime ECL for impaired financial assets.   3.5.2. Estimation of Expected Credit Loss       The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined  below and the key elements are as follows:      Probability of Default (PD) -  The Probability of  Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default  over a given time horizon.       The Group uses historical information where  available to determine PD. Considering the different  products and schemes, the Group has bifurcated its  loan portfolio into various pools. For certain pools  where historical information is available, the PD is  calculated considering fresh slippage of past years.  For those pools where historical information is not  available, the PD/ default rates as stated by external  reporting agencies is considered.      Exposure at Default (EAD) -  The Exposure at  Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future  default date, considering expected changes in  the exposure after the reporting date, including  repayments of principal and interest, whether  scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected draw  downs on committed facilities, and accrued interest  from missed payments.      Loss Given Default (LGD) –  The Loss Given Default  is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where  a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the  difference between the contractual cash flows due  and those that the lender would expect to receive,  including from the realisation of any collateral.     Forward looking information       While estimating the expected credit losses, the  Group reviews macro-economic developments  occurring in the economy and market it operates.  On a periodic basis, the Group analyses if there is  any relationship between key economic trends like  GDP, unemployment rates, benchmark rates set by  the Reserve Bank of India, in fl ation etc. with the  estimate of PD, LGD determined by the Group based  on its internal data. While the internal estimates of  PD, LGD rates by the Group may not be always  re fl ective of such relationships, temporary overlays,  if any, are embedded in the methodology to re fl ect  such macro-economic trends reasonably.       To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the  Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The  collateral comes in various forms, such as cash,  securities, letters of credit/guarantees, vehicles,  etc. However, the fair value of collateral affects the  calculation of ECLs. The collateral is majorly the  property for which the loan is given. The fair value  of the same is based on data provided by third party  or management judgements.       Loans are written off (either partially or in full)  when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This  is generally the case when the Group determines  350 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements that the borrower does not have assets or sources  of income that could generate suf fi cient cash  fl ows  to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs.  Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are  credited to the Statement of Pro fi t and Loss. 3.6.    Determination of fair value of Financial  Instruments     The Group measures financial instruments, such as,  investments at fair value at each balance sheet date.     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.  The fair value measurement is based on the presumption  that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability  takes place either:   i.   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or   ii.     In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability     The principal or the most advantageous market must be  accessible by the Group.     The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using  the assumptions that market participants would use  when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market  participants act in their economic best interest.     A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into  account a market participant’s ability to generate economic  benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by  selling it to another market participant that would use the  asset in its highest and best use.     The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate  in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are  available to measure fair value, maximising the use of  relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of  unobservable inputs.     The financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy  of valuation techniques, as summarised below:     Level 1 financial instruments −Those where the inputs used  in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active  markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has  access to at the measurement date. The Group considers  markets as active only if there are sufficient trading  activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the  identical assets or liabilities and when there are binding and  exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date.     Level 2 financial instruments−Those where the inputs  that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived  from directly or indirectly observable market data available  over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs  include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active  markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive  markets and observable inputs other than quoted prices  such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities,  and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be  required for the condition or location of the asset or the  extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to  the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are  based on unobservable inputs which are significant to the  entire measurement, the Group will classify the instruments  as Level 3.     Level 3 financial instruments − Those that include one  or more unobservable input that is signi fi cant to the  measurement as whole. 3.7.   Derivative financial instruments     The Group enters into derivative financial instruments such  as foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency  swaps to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk  and interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.     Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the  date when a derivative contract is entered into and are  subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance  sheet date and carried as assets when their fair value is  positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.  The resulting gain/loss is recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is  designated and is effective as a hedging instrument, in  which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement  of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedge  relationship. The Company has designated the derivative  351 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements financial instruments as cash flow hedges of recognised  liabilities and unrecognised firm commitments.   Hedge accounting     In order to manage particular risks, the Company applies  hedge accounting for transactions that meet specific criteria.     At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company  formally designates and documents the hedge relationship  and the risk management objective and strategy for  undertaking the hedge. The company enters into  derivative financial instruments that have critical terms  aligned with the hedged item and in accordance with the  Risk management policy of the company, the hedging  relationship is extended to the entire term of the hedged  item. The hedges are expected to be highly effective if the  hedging instrument is offsetting changes in fair value or  cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged  risk. The assessment of hedge effectiveness is carried out  at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine that  the hedging relationship has been effective throughout the  financial reporting periods for which they were designated.     Cash Flow Hedges     A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability  in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  associated with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or  some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a  highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit  and loss. For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges,  the effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on the  hedging instrument is initially recognised directly in OCI  within equity (cash flow hedge reserve). The ineffective  portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is  recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. The company designates the spot element of foreign  currency forward contracts as hedging instruments. The  changes in the fair value of forward element of the forward  contract on reporting date is deferred and retained in the  cost of hedging reserve. When the hedged cash flow  affects the Statement of Profit and Loss, the effective  portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is  recorded in the corresponding income or expense line  of the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a hedging  instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or when  a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,  any cumulative gain or loss that has been recognised in OCI  at that time remains in OCI and is recognised when the  hedged forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecast transaction  is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss  that was reported in OCI is immediately transferred to the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 3.8.   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at banks and  on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three  months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value.     For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and  cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits,  as defined above and investment in reverse re-purchase  against treasury bills and bonds, net of outstanding bank  overdrafts if any, as they are considered an integral part of  the Group’s cash management. 3.9.   Property, plant and equipment     Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are measured at  cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment, if any. Cost of an item of property, plant and  equipment comprises its purchase price, including import  duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting  trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of  bringing the item to its working condition for its intended  use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the  item and restoring the site on which it is located.     Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets,  outstanding at each reporting date are shown under  other non-financial assets. The cost of property, plant and  equipment not ready for its intended use at each reporting  date are disclosed as capital work-in-progress.     Subsequent expenditure related to the asset are added to  its carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only if  it increases the future benefits of the existing asset, beyond  its previously assessed standards of performance and cost  can be measured reliably. Other repairs and maintenance  costs are expensed off as and when incurred. 352 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements   3.9.1. Depreciation         Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment  is calculated by the Company and subsidiary  companies incorporated in India using written  down value method (WDV) to write down the  cost of property and equipment to their residual  values over their estimated useful lives which is in  line with the estimated useful life as specified in  Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or useful life  estimated by the respective management based on  technical evaluation.     The estimated useful lives are as follows: Particulars Useful life Leasehold Improvements 10 years Furniture and fixture 10 years  Plant 15 years Office equipment (MML, MHIL, BML,  MFL) 5 years  Office equipment (MIBPL) 10 years  Server and networking  6 years  Computers 3 years Building 30 years Building RCC Frame Structure (MFL) 60 years Vehicles (MML, MFL) 8  years Vehicles (MIBPL, BML) 10 years Wind Mill 22 years       In respect of foreign subsidiary AAF, the Property,  Plant and Equipment are depreciated on straight line  method over the estimated useful life of the assets.     The estimated useful lives are as follows: Particulars Useful life Building 8 years  Plant 8 years Furniture and fixture 6 years  Office equipment 6 years  Vehicles 6.5  years Computers 6 years       The residual values, useful lives and methods of  depreciation of property, plant and equipment are  reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate. Changes in the  expected useful life are accounted for by changing  the amortisation period or methodology, as  appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting  estimates. In Holding Company, Property, plant,  and equipment with an individual acquisition cost  not exceeding ₹5,000 shall be expensed in the year  of purchase.       Property plant and equipment is derecognised  on disposal or when no future economic benefits  are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising  on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds and  the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in  other income/ expense in the Statement of Profit  and Loss in the year the asset is derecognised. The  date of disposal of an item of property, plant and  equipment is the date the recipient obtains control  of that item in accordance with the requirements  for determining when a performance obligation is  satisfied in Ind AS 115. 3.10. Intangible assets     An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can  be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected  future economic benefits that are attributable to it will  flow to the Group.     Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on  initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset  comprises its purchase price including import duties and  non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade  discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of  bringing the item to its working condition for its intended  use. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are  carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any  accumulated impairment losses.     Subsequent expenditure related to the assets added to its  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only  if it increases the future benefits of the existing asset,  beyond its previously assessed standards of performance  and cost can be measured reliably.     Intangible assets comprising of software is amortised by  the Company and MML and MIBPL on straight line basis  353 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements over a period of 5 years, unless it has a shorter useful  life. In respect of BML and AAF computer software are  amortized over a period of 3 years and 8 years respectively.  In respect of MHIL, intangible assets are amortised on a  WDV basis over a period of 5 years, unless it has a shorter  useful life.     Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets  are measured as the difference between the net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the  asset is derecognised. 3.11. Investment Property     Properties, held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation  are classified as investment property and measured and  reported at cost, including transaction costs.     An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or  when the investment property is permanently withdrawn  from use and no future economic benefits are expected  from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition  of property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss in the same period.     The fair value of investment property is disclosed in  the notes accompanying the consolidated financial  statements. Fair value has been determined by  independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant  professional qualification and has recent experience in the  location and category of the investment property being  valued. The estimated useful life is 15 years. 3.12.    Impairment of non–financial assets: Property,  Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets and  Investment property     The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there  is any indication that any Property, Plant and Equipment,  Intangible Assets, investment property or group of assets  called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If  any such indication exists, or when annual impairment  testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the  asset’s recoverable amount to determine the extent of  impairment, if any.     An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s  or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs  of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is  determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does  not generate cash inflows that are largely independent  of those from other assets or groups of assets. When  the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its  recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and  is written down to its recoverable amount.     In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows  are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of  the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent  market transactions are taken into account. If no such  transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation  model is used. These calculations are corroborated by  valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly  traded companies or other available fair value indicators.     An assessment is made at each reporting date to  determine whether there is an indication that previously  recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have  decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates  the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously  recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has  been a change in the assumptions used to determine the  asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss  was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying  amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable  amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have  been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment  loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such  reversal is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which  case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 3.13. Finance Cost     Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised  by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross  carrying amount of financial liabilities other than financial  liabilities classified as FVTPL.   The EIR in case of a financial liability is computed:   a.       As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future  cash payments through the expected life of the  financial liability to the gross carrying amount of the  amortised cost of a financial liability. 354 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements   b.     By considering all the contractual terms of the financial  instrument in estimating the cash flows.   c.     Including all fees paid between parties to the contract  that are an integral part of the effective interest rate,  transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.     Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future  cash flows is recognised in interest expense with the  corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the  financial liability.     Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially  recognised as part of the carrying value of the financial  liability and amortised over the expected life using  the effective interest method. These include fees and  commissions payable to advisers and other expenses such  as external legal costs, rating fee etc, provided these are  incremental costs that are directly related to the issue of a  financial liability. 3.14. Other expenses     Expenses are recognised on accrual basis net of the goods  and services tax, except where credit for the input tax is  not statutorily permitted. 3.15. Employee Benefits Expenses   3.15.1. Short Term Employee Benefits       The undiscounted amount of short term employee  benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the  services rendered by employees are recognised as  an expense during the period when the employees  render the services   3.15.2. Post-Employment Benefits     A.   Defined contribution schemes         All eligible employees of the Group are  entitled to receive benefits under the  provident fund, a defined contribution  plan in which both the employee and the  Group contribute monthly at a stipulated  percentage of the covered employee’s  salary. Contributions are made to  Employees Provident Fund Organization in  respect of Provident Fund, Pension Fund  and Employees Deposit Linked Insurance  Scheme at the prescribed rates and are  charged to Statement of Profit and Loss  at actuals. The Group has no liability for  future provident fund benefits other than  its annual contribution.     B.   Defined Benefit schemes      Gratuity         The Company and its subsidiaries BML, MHIL  and MML provides for gratuity covering  eligible employees under which a lump  sum payment is paid to vested employees  at retirement, death, incapacitation or  termination of employment, of an amount  reckoned on the respective employee’s  salary and his tenor of employment with the  Group. The said companies in the Group  accounts for its liability for future gratuity  benefits based on actuarial valuation  determined at each Balance Sheet date by  an Independent Actuary using Projected  Unit Credit Method. The Companies makes  annual contribution to a Gratuity Fund  administered by Trustees and separate  schemes managed by Kotak Mahindra Life  Insurance Company Limited and/or ICICI  Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited.  In respect of subsidiary BML, contribution  to gratuity fund is made through Life  Insurance Corporation of India group  gratuity fund and Kotak Mahindra Life  Insurance Company Limited. In respect of  subsidiaries MML and MHIL contribution to  gratuity fund is made through Life Insurance  Corporation of India group gratuity fund  and in respect of subsidiary MIBPL separate  schemes are managed by Life Insurance  Corporation of India and ICICI Prudential  Life Insurance Company Limited. In respect  of its foreign subsidiary AAF, future gratuity  benefits are accounted for as liability based  on actuarial valuation by Project Unit Credit  Method in accordance with LKAS 19. The  gratuity liability is not externally funded. 355 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements         The obligation is measured at the present  value of the estimated future cash flows.         An actuarial valuation involves making  various assumptions that may differ from  actual developments in the future. These  include the determination of the discount  rate, future salary increases and mortality  rates. Due to the complexities involved in  the valuation and its long-term nature, these  liabilities are highly sensitive to changes  in these assumptions. All assumptions are  reviewed at each reporting date.         Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial  gains and losses (excluding amounts  included in net interest on the net de fi ned  bene fi t liability), are recognized immediately  in the balance sheet with a corresponding  debit or credit to retained earnings through  Other Comprehensive Income in the period  in which they occur. Re-measurements  are not reclassi fi ed to pro fi t and loss in  subsequent periods.   3.15.3. Other Long term employee benefits     Accumulated compensated absences       The Group provides for liability of accumulated  compensated absences for eligible employees on  the basis of an independent actuarial valuation  carried out at the end of the year, using the  projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and  losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss for the period in which they occur.   3.15.4. Employee share based payments       Stock options granted to the employees of  the Company under the stock option scheme  established are accounted as per the accounting  treatment prescribed by the SEBI (Share Based  Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 issued by  Securities and Exchange Board of India.       The Company follows the fair value method of  accounting for the options and accordingly, the  excess of market value of the stock options as on  the date of grant over the fair value of the options  is recognised as deferred employee compensation  cost and is charged to the Statement of Profit  and Loss on graded vesting basis over the vesting  period of the options.       The dilutive effect of outstanding options is  reflected as additional share dilution in the  computation of diluted earnings per share. 3.16. Provisions (other than employee benefits)     Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past  events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of the obligation.     When the effect of the time value of money is material, the  enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting  the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the  current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating  to any provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and  Loss net of any reimbursement. 3.17. Taxes     Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and  deferred tax.   3.17.1. Current Tax       Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable  in respect of taxable profit for a period. Taxable  profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in  the Statement of Profit and Loss because of items  of income or expense that are taxable or deductible  in other years and items that are never taxable or  deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws.       The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the  amount are those that are enacted, or substantively  enacted, by the end of reporting date where the  respective Company operates and generates  taxable income. 356 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements       Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit  or loss i.e., either in other comprehensive income  or in equity. Current tax items are recognised in  correlation to the underlying transaction either in  other comprehensive income or directly in equity.  Management periodically evaluates positions  taken in the tax returns with respect to situations  in which applicable tax regulations are subject  to interpretation and establishes provisions  where appropriate.   3.17.2. Deferred tax       Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences  at the reporting date between the tax bases of  assets and liabilities used in the computation of  taxable profit and their carrying amounts in the  consolidated financial statements for financial  reporting purposes.       Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable  temporary differences, except:     i.     Where the deferred tax liability arises from the  initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or  liability in a transaction that is not a business  combination and, at the time of the transaction,  affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable  profit or loss     ii.    In respect of taxable temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  where the timing of the reversal of the temporary  differences can be controlled and it is probable  that the temporary differences will not reverse in  the foreseeable future       Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible  temporary differences, the carry forward of unused  tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred  tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is  probable that taxable profit will be available against  which the deductible temporary differences, and  the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused  tax losses can be utilised, except:     i.    When the deferred tax asset relating to the  deductible temporary difference arises from  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in  a transaction that is not a business combination  and, at the time of the transaction, affects  neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit  or loss     ii.    In respect of deductible temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures,  deferred tax assets are recognised only to the  extent that it is probable that the temporary  differences will reverse in the foreseeable future  and taxable profit will be available against which  the temporary differences can be utilised       The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient  taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of  the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised  deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting  date and are recognised to the extent that it has  become probable that future taxable profits will  allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  year when the asset is realised or the liability is  settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date.       Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside  profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss i.e.,  either in other comprehensive income or in equity.  Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation  to the underlying transaction either in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity.       Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are  offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off  current tax assets against current tax liabilities and  the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity  and the same taxation authority. 357 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements 3.18. Contingent Liabilities and Assets     A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises  from past events whose existence will be con fi rmed  by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more  uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group  or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is  not probable that an out fl ow of resources will be required  to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in  extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot  be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably.  The Group does not recognize a contingent liability but  discloses its existence in the  fi nancial statements.     A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past  events and whose existence will be con fi rmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain  future events not wholly within the control of the entity.  The Group does not have any contingent assets in the  fi nancial statements. 3.19. Earnings Per Share     The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in  accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic  EPS is calculated by dividing the net pro fi t or loss for the  year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting  preference dividend and attributable taxes) by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the year.     For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net pro fi t  or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders  and the weighted average number of shares outstanding  during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive  potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares  are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period,  unless they have been issued at a later date. In computing  the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares  that are dilutive and that either reduces the earnings per  share or increases loss per share are included. 3.20. Foreign currency transactions     Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the  functional currency of the Group at the exchange rates  at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the  average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of  the transaction.     Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are translated into the functional currency at  the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary  assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in  a foreign currency are translated into the functional  currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was  determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are  measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency  are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the  transaction. Exchange differences are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 3.21. Cash-flow statement     Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of  transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or  accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. The  cash flows from regular revenue generating, investing  and financing activities of the Group are segregated. 3.22. Leases     Effective 01 April 2019, the Group had applied Ind AS 116  ‘Leases’/SLFRS 16 to all lease contracts existing on 01 April  2019 by adopting the modified retrospective approach.     The Group evaluates each contract or arrangement,  whether it qualifies as lease as defined under Ind AS 116/ SLFRS 16. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract  conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset.   The Group as a lessee     The Group has elected not to recognise right-of use assets  and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease  term of less than or equal to 12 months and leases with  low value assets. The Group determines the lease term  as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with  periods covered by an option to extend the lease, where  the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option.     The Group recognises the lease payments associated with  these leases as an expense in Statement of Profit and Loss  on a straight-line basis over the lease term or another  systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the  pattern of the lessee’s benefit. The related cash flows are  classified as operating activities. 358 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements     Wherever the above exception permitted under Ind AS  116 is not applicable/or as per SLFRS 16, the Group at the  time of initial recognition: •   measures lease liability as present value of all lease  payments discounted using the Group’s incremental  cost of borrowing and directly attributable costs.  Subsequently, the lease liability is increased by interest  on lease liability, reduced by lease payments made  and remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease  modifications specified in the standard, or to reflect  revised fixed lease payments. •   measures ‘Right-of-use assets’ as present value of  all lease payments discounted using the Group’s  incremental cost of borrowing and any initial direct  costs. Subsequently, ‘Right-of-use assets’ is measured  using cost model i.e. at cost less any accumulated  depreciation (depreciated on straight line basis over  the lease period) and any accumulated impairment  losses adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease  liability specified in the standard.   The Group as a lessor     Leases under which the Group is a lessor are classified  as finance or operating leases. Lease contracts where all  the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the  lessee, the lease contracts are classified as finance leases.  All other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease  payments from operating leases are recognised as an  income in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight- line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis  if that basis is more representative of the pattern in which  benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished. 4.     Significant accounting judgements, estimates  and assumptions     The preparation of  fi nancial statements in conformity with  the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities  and the accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of  contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised  if the revision affects only that period or in the period of  the revision and future periods if the revision affects both  current and future periods. Although these estimates are  based on the management’s best knowledge of current  events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions  and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a  material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or  liabilities in future periods.     In particular, information about signi fi cant areas of  estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying  accounting policies that have the most signi fi cant effect  on the amounts recognized in the consolidated  fi nancial  statements is included in the following notes: 4.1.   Business Model Assessment     Classification and measurement of financial assets depends  on the results of the solely payments of principal and  interest test, and the business model test. The respective  companies in the Group determines the business model  at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets  are managed together to achieve a particular business  objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting  all relevant evidence including how the performance of the  assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the  risks that affect the performance of the assets and how  these are managed and how the managers of the assets  are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets  measured at amortised cost or fair value through other  comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their  maturity to understand the reason for their disposal and  whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of  the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is  part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the  business model for which the remaining financial assets are  held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate  whether there has been a change in business model and so  a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 4.2.   Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method     The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income  using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a  constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of  loans given and recognises the effect of potentially different  interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of  the product life cycle (including prepayments and penalty  interest and charges). 359 Consolidated  / Financial Statements Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 

Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements     This estimation, by nature, requires an element of  judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life- cycle of the instruments, probable fluctuations in collateral  value as well as expected changes to India’s base rate  and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of  the instrument. 4.3.   Impairment of loans portfolio     The measurement of impairment losses across all categories  of financial assets requires judgement, in particular, the  estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows  and collateral values when determining impairment losses  and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk.  These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes  in which can result in different levels of allowances.     It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its  models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust  when necessary. 4.4.    De fi ned employee bene fi t assets and liabilities     The cost of the de fi ned bene fi t gratuity plan and the  present value of the gratuity obligation are determined  using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves  making various assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include the determination  of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality  rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and  its long-term nature, a de fi ned bene fi t obligation is highly  sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions  are reviewed at each reporting date. 4.5.   Fair value measurement     When the fair values of  fi nancial assets and  fi nancial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured  based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is  measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable markets where  possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment  is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk  and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors  could affect the reported fair value of  fi nancial instruments. 4.6.   Determination of lease term     Ind AS 116 “Leases” requires lessee to determine the lease  term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted  with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the  use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes  assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease  basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain  that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be  exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers  factors such as any significant leasehold improvements  undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the  termination of lease and the importance of the underlying  to the Group’s operations taking into account the location  of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable  alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed  to ensure that the lease term reflects the current  economic circumstances. 4.7.   Other estimates     These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible  and intangible assets etc. 360 Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25

As of the effective date of  transfer, the net carrying amount of these loans stood at ₹730.84 million, after accounting for an impairment allowance of  ₹1,861.19 million.

The residual excess provision of ₹19.15 million under the impairment allowance has been adjusted against the carrying  value of the Security Receipts (“SRs”).As per the agreed terms, BML subscribed to SRs issued by the ARC trust amounting to  ₹651.90 million, classified under Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). Since the transaction was completed on December  30, 2024, the recovery rating process by the ARC Trust will commence from the half-year ending June 30, 2025. As of March 31,  2025, the face value of the SRs stands at ₹977.39 million, while the net asset value (NAV) declared by the ARC Trust is ₹760.88  million.

Accordingly  an amount representing 20% of Profit for the period is transferred to the fund for the year. (b)    Securities Premium     This Reserve represents the premium on issue of equity shares and can be utilized in accordance with the provisions of the  Companies Act, 2013. (c)    Debenture Redemption Reserve     Pursuant to Rule 18(7)(b)(iii) of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, as amended vide the Companies  (Share Capital and Debentures) Amendment Rules, August 16, 2019, the Company, being an NBFC registered with the  Reserve Bank of India under Section 45 IA of the RBI Act, 1934, is not required to create a Debenture Redemption Reserve,  in respect of public issue of debentures and debentures issued by it on a private placement basis. (d)    General Reserve     Under the erstwhile Companies Act 1956, general reserve was created through an annual transfer of profit for the period  at a specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations. Consequent to introduction of Companies Act 2013,  the requirement to mandatorily transfer a specified percentage of the net profit to general reserve has been withdrawn.  However, the amount previously transferred to the general reserve can be utilised only in accordance with the specific  requirements of Companies Act, 2013. (e)    Share Options outstanding account     The fair value of equity settled share based payments transactions is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss with  corresponding credit to Share option outstanding account. (f)    Retained earnings     This Reserve represents the cumulative profits of the Company. This Reserve can be utilized in accordance with the provisions  of the Companies Act, 2013.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements (g)    Capital Redemption Reserve     The amount in Capital Redemption Reserve is equal to nominal arnount of the Non-Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares  redeemed. The Group may issue fully paid up bonus shares to its members out of the capital redemption reserve account. (h)    Capital Reserve     A capital reserve is used for contingencies or to offset capital losses. It is derived from the accumulated capital surplus  created out of capital profit. (i)    Other Comprehensive Income   Equity instruments through Other Comprehensive Income     The Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in other  comprehensive income. These changes are accumulated in the FVOCI equity investments reserve. The Company transfers  amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.   Effective portion of Cash Flow Hedges and Cost of Hedging Reserve     Effective portion of cash flow hedges represents the cumulative gains/(losses) arising on changes in fair value of the derivative  instruments designated as cash flow hedges through OCI. The amount recognized as effective portion of Cash flow hedge is  reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The company designates the spot element of foreign  currency forward contracts as hedging instruments. The changes in the fair value of forward element of the forward contract  on reporting date is deferred and retained in the cost of hedging reserve.   Remeasurement of defined benefit plans   It represents the gain/(loss) on remeasurement of Defined Benefit Obligation and of Plan assets.   Revaluation Surplus     When carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase  shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.  However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same  asset previously recognised in profit or loss.When carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is decreased  as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, the decrease shall be recognised in  other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.  The decrease recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in equity under the heading of  revaluation surplus. The revaluation surplus included in equity in respect of an item of property, plant and equipment may  be transferred directly to retained earnings when the asset is derecognised. Transfers from revaluation surplus to retained  earnings are not made through profit or loss.   Gain/ (loss) from translating financial statements of foreign operations     The Group is required to convert the financial statements of its foreign operations into its functional currency, which is the  Indian Rupee. This translation process involves using the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period for assets and  liabilities and the exchange rates at the transaction dates for income and expenses. The resulting exchange differences from  this translation are not recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Instead, they are recorded separately as a component  of other equity known as the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR). Note 25: Other equity (Contd.)

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements     However, there are two exceptions to this approach. Firstly, if the exchange differences pertain to a non-controlling interest  (NCI) in a subsidiary, the Group allocates the relevant portion of these differences to the NCI. Secondly, if the Group disposes  of a foreign operation, either wholly or partially, the cumulative amount of exchange differences in the FCTR is transferred  to the Statement of Profit and Loss. This transfer becomes a part of the gain or loss on disposal. 25.2 Dividend proposed to be distributed to equity shareholders for the period Dividend proposed to be distributed to equity shareholders for the period (not recognised as liability) Interim dividend for 2024-25 @ ₹26/- per equity share       10,438.06 Date of declaration of interim dividend for the period       April 21, 2025 Note 26: Interest income Particulars  Year ended March 31, 2025   Year ended March 31, 2024  On Financial  asset measured  at fair value  through OCI On Financial  asset measured  at amortised  cost Interest income  on financial  assets classified  at fair value  through profit  or loss On Financial  asset measured  at fair value  through OCI On Financial  asset measured  at amortised  cost Interest income  on financial  assets classified  at fair value  through profit  or loss Interest on Loans: Gold Loan   -     1,63,191.61    -      -     1,20,645.85    -    Corporate Loans   -     119.61    -      -     145.01    -    Personal Loan   -     2,719.93    -      -     1,416.24    -    Staff Loan   -     13.84    -      -     9.23    -    Housing Loans   -     2,676.51    -      -     1,761.18    -    Mortgage loans   -     376.81    -      -     82.99    -    Pledge loans   -     12.60    -      -     17.10    -    Business Loans   -     478.76    -      -     448.72    -    Vehicle Loan   -     354.69    -      -     278.87    -    Microfinance loan   -     19,673.82    -      -     16,333.02    -    Insta Personal Loan   -     1,771.38    -      -     722.87    -    Business Loans - SME    -     803.15    -      -     132.16    -    Loan Against Property   -     83.78    -      -     0.01    -    Other loans   -     26.60    -      -     15.90    -    Interest on hire purchase   -      -      -      -     0.90    -    Interest income from investments   -     3,323.08    -      -     2,236.28    -    Interest on deposits with banks   -     578.78    -      -     845.37    -    Interest on treasury bills   -     164.04    -      -     149.26    -    Interest Income on Unit Trust   -     73.79    -      -     78.84    -    Other interest income   -     186.06    -      -     137.21    -    Total   -    196,628.84    -      -     145,457.01    -    Note 25: Other equity (Contd.)

Description of funding arrangements and funding policy that affect future contributions The liabilities of the fund are funded by assets. The Group aims to maintain a close to full-funding position at each Balance Sheet  date. Future expected contributions are disclosed based on this principle. The principal assumptions used in determining leave encashment obligations for the Group’s plans are  shown below: The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Government of India securities as at the balance sheet date for the  estimated term of the obligations. The estimate of future salary increases considered, takes into account the in fl ation, seniority,  promotion, increments, mortality, withdrawals and other relevant factors.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements Investment at fair value through profit and loss   For investment at fair value through profit and loss, valuation is done using quoted prices from active markets at the measurement  date. The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily available active prices on a regular  basis are classified as Level 1. Units held in mutual funds are measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into  account redemption and/or other restrictions are generally Level 1.   The fair valuation technique for investments  in Security receipts (SRs)  by Belstar Microfinance Limited is classified under Level 3.  The methodology for arriving at the Net Asset Value (NAV) of SR is based on evaluating the recovery prospects of the assets in the  trust. The relevant inputs used in this regard are the historical recovery data and the associated expected timelines for recovery.  Since, as a matter of prudence the Belstar Microfinance Limited continues to consider the impact  of NAV  in determining the  fair value of SR’s as at March 31, 2025, the disclosure of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable  inputs is not considered relevant.” Derivative Financial Instruments (assets/liabilities) at fair value through other comprehensive income   The financial assets/liabilities on derivative contracts has been valued at fair value through other comprehensive income using  closing rate and is classified as Level 2. Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income   Equity instruments in non-listed entities are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured as per fair valuation report on  a case-by-case and classified as Level 2. The equity instruments which are actively traded on public stock exchanges with readily  available active prices on a regular basis are classified as Level 1.

Such instruments include: cash and cash equivalents,  trade receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents and trade payables without a specific maturity. Loans and advances to customers The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models that incorporate assumptions for credit  risks, probability of default and loss given default estimates. Since comparable data is not available, Credit risk is derived using,  historical experience, management view and other information used in its collective impairment models. Fair values of portfolios are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into homogenous groups  based on similar characteristics i.e., type of loan. The respective company then calculates and extrapolates the fair value to the  entire portfolio using effective interest rate model that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics  of the loans. The credit risk is applied as a top-side adjustment based on the collective impairment model incorporating probability  of defaults and loss given defaults. Hence, the carrying amount of such financial assets at amortised cost net of impairment loss  allowance is of reasonable approximation of their fair value. Note 43: Fair Value Measurement (Contd.)

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements Investments- at amortised cost For Government Securities,the market value of the respective Government stock as on the date of reporting has been considered  for fair value computations. Debt Securities The fair value of debt securities is estimated by a discounted cash flow model incorporating interest rate estimates from market  observable data such as secondary prices for its traded debt itself. Financial liabilities at amortised cost The fair values of financial liabilities held-to-maturity (financial liabilities other than trade payables and debt securities) are  estimated using effective interest rate model based on contractual cash flows using actual yields. Since the cost of borrowing on  the reporting date is not expected to be significantly different from the actual yield considered under effective interest rate model,  the carrying value of financial liabilities at amortised cost is considered a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Note 44: Risk Management Risk is an integral part of the Group’s business and sound risk management is critical to the success. Further, the Group is exposed  to risks that are particular to its lending and the environment within which it operates and primarily includes credit, liquidity and  market risks. The companies in the Group have a risk management policy which covers risk associated with the financial assets  like loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, etc. and financial liabilities like borrowings, debt securities,  subordinate liabilities, trade and other payables. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The Group has identified and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout  the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the  agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The  process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Group has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically  addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis. The Group is generally exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market  risk and operational risk. A.    Credit Risk     Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to  the Group. The Group’s major income generating activity is gold loan, housing loan, receivables through financing activity,  vehicle loan, personal loans and others. Therefore credit risk is a principal risk. Credit risk mainly arises from loans and  advances to customers and investments in debt securities that are an asset position. The Group considers all elements of  credit risk exposure such as counterparty default risk, risk of not taking collateral against loans, geographical risk and sector  risk for risk management purposes. The Group also follow a systematic methodology in the opening of new branches, which  takes into account factors such as demand for credit in the area; income and market potential; and socio-economic and law  and order risks in the proposed area.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements   I.    Policies and procedures for credit risk for different products     The Group addresses credit risk by following different processes for different products:     a)    Gold Loan       a)      Credit risk on Gold loan is considerably reduced as collateral is Gold ornaments which can be easily liquidated  and there is only a distant possibility of losses due to adequate margin of 25% or more retained while  disbursing the loan. Credit risk is further reduced through a quick but careful collateral appraisal and loan  approval process. Hence overall, the credit risk is normally low.       b)      Sanctioning powers for Gold Loans is delegated to various authorities at branches/controlling offices.  Sanctioning power is used only for granting loans for legally permitted purposes. The maximum Loan to  Value does not exceed the limit stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India under any circumstances.       c)      Gold ornaments brought for pledge is the primary responsibility of Branch Manager. Branch executives  should enquire with the customers about the ownership of the ornaments being pledged for loan and the  loan should be granted only after they are convinced about the genuineness of the customer and his capacity  to own that much quantity of gold. In addition to the above, customers are also required to sign a declaration  of ownership of ornaments offered as security for the loan. Extra care is taken if the gold jewellery brought  for pledge by any customer at any one time or cumulatively is more than 20 gm. The declaration should also  contain an explanation specifically as to how the ownership was vested with the customer.       d)      Auctions are conducted as per the Auction Policy of the Group and the guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of  India. Auction is generally conducted if total dues on the loan is not repaid by due date. After reasonable time  is given to the customers for release after loan becomes overdue and exhausting all efforts for persuasive  recovery, auction is resorted to as the last measure in unavoidable cases. Group has the right to recover  dues remaining evenafter set off of amount received on auctions from the customer. Any excess received on  auctions over and above the dues are refunded to the customer.       e)      In case of loans other than Gold Loan, loans are given whether with primary/collateral security, like secured  loans or without any primary/collateral security like unsecured loans, more than ordinary care is taken such  that loans are granted only to persons/firms/companies of repute with credit worthiness, future cash flows  to repay the loan and track record.     b)    Housing loan and Vehicle loan         The credit risk management policy of the Group seeks to have following controls and key metrics that allows  credit risks to be identified, assessed, monitored and reported in a timely and efficient manner in compliance with  regulatory requirements:       -    Standardize the process of identifying new risks and designing appropriate controls for these risks.       -    Minimize losses due to defaults or untimely payments by borrowers.       -    Maintain an appropriate credit administration and loan review system.       -    Establish metrics for portfolio monitoring.       -    Design appropriate credit risk mitigation techniques.

Risk assessment and measurement         Group is having a robust risk assessment framework to address each of the identified risks. The following is the  framework implemented in order to ensure completeness and robustness of the risk assessment for housing loan  and receivables under financing activity.       -    Selection of client base - Adequate due diligence is carried out for selection of customers.        -    Credit assessment - credit rating and credit bureau check.       -    Follow up and regular monitoring of the group.     Risk  Mitigation       The following risk mitigation measures have been suggested at each stage of loan life cycle:       -    Loan Origination - site screening, independent visit by manager, adequate training to officers.       -    Loan underwriting - Risk rating, independent assessment, etc.         -      Loan Pre and Post Disbursement - disbursement at the branch premises and in the bank account only,  tracking to avoid misuse of funds.       -      Loan monitoring - credit officers to attend group meeting, reminder of payment of EMI’s on time, etc.       -    Loan collection and recovery - monitor repayments, confirmation of balances.     c)    Receivables under financing activity     Risk  Identification       Credit risk may originate in one or multiple of following ways mentioned below:       -    Adverse selection of members for group formation eg. (bogus members, defaulters, etc.).       -      Adverse selection of groups for undertaking lending activity (unknown members due to geographical vicinity,  etc.).       -      Gap in credit assessment of borrower’s credit worthiness (Failure to collect KYC documents, verify residential  address, assess income source, etc.       -    Undue Influence of Animator/Representative on group members (misuses of savings of group, etc.).       -    Sanction of higher loan amount.       -    Improper use of loan amount than the designated activity.       -    Over-concentration in any geography/branch/zone etc       -      Change in the savings pattern/meeting pattern of group post availing loan (eg. failure of members to deposit  minimum savings amount each month, absence of members from meetings, etc.).

II.    Impairment assessment     Definition of default and cure       The Group considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore stage 3 (credit - impaired) for ECL calculations in  all cases when the borrower becomes 91 days past due including the due date on its contractual payments. As part  of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that  may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such event occurs, the Group carefully considers whether the event should result  in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as stage 3 for ECL calculations. It is the Group’s policy  to consider a financial instrument as ‘cured’ and therefore re-classified out of Stage 3 only when none of the default  criterias have been present. Accordingly, revenue is recognized on financial instruments classified as Stage 3 when none  of the default criteria is present. The decision whether to classify an asset as Stage 2 or Stage 1 once cured depends  on the updated credit grade, at the time of the cure, and whether this indicates there has been a significant increase in  credit risk compared to initial recognition. Note 44: Risk Management (Contd.) Muthoot Finance Limited Annual Report 2024-25 436 

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements     Group’s internal credit rating grades and staging criteria for loans are as follows: Rating  Loans Days past due (DPD)  including the due date Stages High grade Not yet due Stage 1 Standard grade 1-30 DPD Stage 1 Sub-standard grade 31-60 DPD Stage 2 Past due but not impaired 61-90 DPD Stage 2 Impaired 91 DPD or More  Stage 3     Exposure at Default (EAD)       The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the  exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or  otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest.     Probability of Default (PD)       The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. For Stage 1 financial  assets, the Group assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation of the 12 month ECL. For  Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the instruments.  The Group uses historical information wherever available to determine PD. PD is calculated using Incremental 91 DPD  approach considering fresh slippage using historical information. Where historical information is not available, the PD/ default rates as stated by external reporting agencies is considered. Where appropriate, the Group makes adjustments  to the PD estimate outside the Group’s regular modelling process to reflect management judgments. Changes to  the assumptions underlying these judgemental adjustments could materially affect ECL in next 12 months. These  adjustments include post-model adjustments and overlays.     Loss Given Default (LGD)       LGD is the estimated loss that the Group might suffer if the borrower defaults. The Group determines its recovery (net  present value) by analysing the recovery trends, borrower rating, collateral value and expected proceeds from sale of  asset/collateral. The LGD rates have been computed internally based on the discounted recoveries in default accounts  that are closed / written off / repossessed and upgraded during the year. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for  a group of similar assets, the group applies same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase  in credit risk since initial recognition. Where appropriate, the Group makes adjustments to the LGD estimate outside  the Group’s regular modelling process to reflect management judgments. Changes to the assumptions underlying  these judgemental adjusments could materially affect ECL in next 12 months. These adjustments include post-model  adjustments and overlays. B.    Liquidity Risk     Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not meet its financial obligations. Liquidity risk arises due to the unavailability  of adequate funds at an appropriate cost or tenure. The objective of liquidity risk management, is to maintain sufficient  liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generates sufficient cash  flows from operating and financial activities to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The Group mobilises  funds from multiple sources, including from banks, financial institutions and capital markets to maintain a healthy mix of  sources. The focus is on diversifying fund raising sources, managing interest rate risks and maintaining a strong relationship  with banks, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, other domestic and foreign financial institutions and  rating agencies to ensure that credit concerns are addressed and thereby liquidity risk is well addressed.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements C.    Market Risk     Market Risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  in market factor. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the interest rates, credit,  liquidity, and other market changes. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings  and equity to loss and reduce our exposure to the volatility inherent in financial instruments. The Group is exposed to four  types of market risk as follows:   (a)    Interest Rate Risk       Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in market interest rates. The Group is subject to interest rate risk, primarily since it lends to customers at fixed  rates and for maturity periods shorter than the funding sources. Majority of our borrowings are at fixed rates. However,  borrowings at floating rates gives rise to interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond  control, including the monetary policies of the Reserve Bank of India, domestic and international economic and political  conditions, inflation and other factors. In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group seek to optimize borrowing  profile between short-term and long-term loans. The Group adopts funding strategies to ensure diversified resource- raising options to minimize cost and maximize stability of funds. Assets and liabilities are categorized into various time  buckets based on their maturities and Asset Liability Management Committee supervises an interest rate sensitivity  report periodically for assessment of interest rate risks. The Interest Rate Risk is mitigated by availing funds at very  competitive rates through diversified borrowings and for different tenors.       During the year, Group has undertaken derivative transactions for hedging interest rate risk on certain domestic  currency exposures linked to external benchmark through Interest Rate Swaps as below: Particulars As at    March 31, 2025 As at    March 31, 2024 Domestic Currency Exposure  17,791.67   13,000.00  The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion  of borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the profit before taxes affected through the impact on  floating rate borrowings are as follows:                         Muthoot Finance Limited Particulars Effect on  Statement of  Profit and Loss      for the year  2024-25 Effect on  Statement of  Profit and Loss      for the year  2023-24 1% increase in interest rates  4,226.51   3,490.33  1% decrease in interest rates  (4,226.51)  (3,490.33) Note 44: Risk Management (Contd.)

This risk is in part mitigated by a minimum  25% margin retained on the value of jewellery for the purpose of calculation of the loan amount. Further, we appraise  the jewellery collateral solely based on the weight of its gold content, excluding weight and value of the stone studded  in the jewellery. In addition, the sentimental value of the gold jewellery to the customers may induce repayment and  redemption of the collateral even if the value of gold ornaments falls below the value of the repayment amount. An  occasional decrease in gold prices will not increase price risk significantly on account of our adequate collateral security  margins. However, a sustained decrease in the market price of gold can additionally cause a decrease in the size of our  loan portfolio and our interest income.       Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decrease as the result of changes in level of equity indices and  individual stocks. The trading equity price risk exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVTPL and the non- trading equity price risk exposure arises from equity securities classified at FVOCI.

( H  in millions, except for share data and unless otherwise stated) Notes  forming part of consolidated financial statements     A 10% increase/(decrease) in the equity price ( traded and non-traded) would have the impact as follows: Particulars Increase/ (Decrease) in  percentage Sensitivity of  profit or loss Sensitivity  of Other  Comprehensive  Income As at March 31, 2025 10/(10) 14.31/(14.31) 220.27/(220.27) As at March 31, 2024 10/(10) 23.24/(23.24) 225.16/(225.16)     For Housing loan and receivables under financing activity       The Group’s exposure to price risk is not material and it is primarily on account of investment of temporary treasury  surplus in the highly liquid debt funds for very short durations. The Group has a board approved policy of investing its  surplus funds in highly rated debt mutual funds and other instruments having insignificant price risk, not being equity  funds/ risk bearing instruments.   (c)    Prepayment risk       Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or  request repayment earlier than expected, such as fixed rate loans like ours when interest rates fall.   (d)    Foreign currency risk       Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  Foreign currency risk for the Group arises majorly on account of foreign currency borrowings. The Group’s foreign  currency exposures are managed in accordance with its Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy which has been  approved by its Board of Directors. The Group has hedged its foreign currency risk on its foreign currency borrowings as  on March 31, 2025 by entering into forward contracts with the intention of covering the entire term of foreign currency  exposure. The counterparties for such hedge transactions are banks.       The Group’s exposure on account of Foreign Currency Borrowings at the end of the reporting period expressed in  Indian Rupees are as follows: Particulars Foreign currency As at    March 31, 2025 As at    March 31, 2024 FCNB Demand Loan (principal amount on reporting date) USD  -     3,902.57  External Commercial Borrowings - Senior Secured Notes (principal  amount and interest accrued but not due on reporting date) USD  121,815.81   -    Since the foreign currency exposure is completely hedged by equivalent derivative instrument, there will not be any  significant impact on sensitivity analysis due to the possible change in the exchange rates where all other variables are  held constant. On the date of maturity of the derivative instrument, considering the hedging for the entire term of the  foreign currency exposure, the sensitivity of profit and loss to changes in the exchange rates will be Nil. D.    Operational and business risk     Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to  operate effectively, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial  loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but it endeavours to manage these risks through a control  framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access,  authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit.
