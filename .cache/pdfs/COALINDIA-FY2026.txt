The government’s  vision is to transform India into a developed nation or Viksit  Bharat by its 100th anniversary of Independence in 2047. A reliable and sustainable source of energy  can only drive this vision forward. Despite  growing focus on renewables, coal has  retained its position as the dominant fuel for  power generation in India. Our country also  has one of the lowest per capita electricity  demand; and is poised to experience huge  demand growth for energy than any other  country over the next decade. During the past few years, we have invested  substantially in large equipment, land, along  with coal transportation and evacuation  infrastructure to enhance our production,  amid the government’s target of enhancing  domestic coal production and reducing the  country’s import dependence. For FY26,  we have set a capital expenditure target  of  J  16,000 crore. In adherence to the  government’s commitment towards reducing  India’s carbon footprint, we have also set a  Net Zero target of 3 GW by FY27-28. We  further intend to ramp up our renewable  capacity by another 6.5 GW by FY 29-30. At CIL, we are energising the grand vision of Viksit Bharat by reaching new milestones in our  production volumes every year and acting as a major catalyst in fuelling India’s growth story. We are powering a substantial portion of India’s primary commercial energy  requirement, which is set to rise significantly in the coming years. CIL has achieved  its highest ever production volume of ~781.06 million tonnes in FY24-25; and our  roadmap is to reach the production target of 1 billion tonne by FY 28-29.

The Evolving Landscape of our Operations India’s coal sector continues to evolve in response to shifting global trends in  energy mix, national policy directions and emergence of new technologies.  Operating in such a scenario, Coal India maintains a responsive and forward- looking approach, balancing productivity goals with sustainability targets,  and steadily expanding its role in energy diversification. Global Supply Context Domestic Demand Drivers International coal production and logistics  are increasingly exposed to geopolitical  issues and price volatility, posing  significant risks to global supply stability. India’s clean energy transition has  accelerated, with 50% non-fossil capacity  achieved five years ahead of target,  driven by strong policy support and  decentralised generation. This shift raises  concerns over long-term coal demand  visibility, as renewables, storage, and  smart grids reshape the power sector. Our business model is primarily focused on domestic supply. With  limited participation in global coal trade, we are less exposed to  fluctuations in international freight costs. This positioning allows us  to take advantage of stable local pricing while expanding volumes  to meet domestic demand. We have long-term Fuel Supply Agreements in place, covering  ~629 million tonnes per year for power sector. These contracts  provide us with consistent offtake from power utilities and enable  long-range planning for production and logistics. CIL’s response CIL’s response https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024 https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024 Coal conveyor at Talcher Resource Endowment Policy and Regulatory Landscape India possesses 389.421 billion tonnes  of geological coal resources, including  212 billion tonnes of proven reserves.  However, most of this is non-coking coal  (around 89%), with limited availability  of high-quality coking coal, resulting in  continued dependence on imports for  the steel industry. India’s coal production targets are set  at 1.3 billion tonnes by FY 2027 and 1.5  billion tonnes by FY 2030. Ten rounds  of commercial mining auctions have  invited private participation. Policies now  place greater emphasis on mechanised  loading and rail logistics through First- Mile Connectivity (FMC) initiatives. At Coal India, our mine development priorities align with India’s thermal  energy needs, focusing on high-quality non-coking reserves. At the  same time, we are exploring joint ventures for coking coal washeries  to strengthen domestic options for steel manufacturers. Our roadmap targets 1.23 billion tonnes by FY 2035, with an 8% annual  growth forecast from FY 2025. We have secured priority access to  railway infrastructure and are expediting project clearances for FMC  implementation. Our diversification into coal gas, coal bed methane  (CBM), and renewable energy aligns with emerging policy incentives  and opens up new revenue avenues.

Technology and Productivity Logistics and Infrastructure Technological upgrades across the  industry now include surface miners,  high-wall mining techniques, and  drone-based surveys to improve cost- efficiency and safety. Automated rapid- loading systems are also replacing  legacy manual processes. Major rail upgrades, including the  Dedicated Freight Corridor and key  line expansions, are enhancing coal  movement capacity. Coastal shipping is  gaining traction with regulatory backing  and discounted long-term agreements. We commissioned 11 new FMC facilities in FY 2024–25, including  upgrades at Dipka and Gevra. These have enhanced loading accuracy  and reduced wagon cycle times. Our centralised command centres are  active across subsidiaries, supporting real-time tracking of operations,  safety and material flow. New railway sidings at Kusmunda and Khadia, combined with  coastal stockyard development, have improved delivery timelines  for coastal power plants. These upgrades strengthen our ability to  manage demand surges and reduce distribution delays. CIL’s response CIL’s response Coal Feeding on Pipe Conveyor at MCL Sustainability Requirements Market Pricing Framework India’s commitment to reach Net-Zero  target by 2070 and reduce coal’s share  in power to 55% by 2030 is driving  policy shifts. New norms require lower  ash content in coal and more stringent  mine closure planning. E-auction premiums eased to 48% in  FY 2025, down from 72% the previous  year, due to improved domestic  supply conditions. We have eight washeries under construction to help lower ash content  and improve fuel quality. With 209.08 MW of cumulative commissioned  solar capacity already operational, we lead the sector in renewable  energy integration. Our mine closure fund is fully provisioned, and  we completed land reclamation of 1,500+ hectares in the past year,  exceeding compliance norms. E-auction premiums have moderated, driven partly by a decline  in international benchmark prices and partly by increased coal  availability in the domestic market. On the operational front, we  have simplified the auction methodology and lowered bid security  requirements to encourage broader bidder participation.

Our ability to perform and adapt to changes in the energy landscape depends significantly on listening to the expectations and  concerns of various stakeholder groups and addressing those issues proactively and effectively. Strategic Context Stakeholder engagement is woven  into how we operate, through periodic  consultations and across every stage  of the mining lifecycle. Whether it is  during exploration, development, active  operations, or mine closure, we use  engagement as a way to shape decisions  on risk, investment and sustainability. By listening and acting on what we hear,  we are able to improve our resilience,  respond to emerging concerns early, and  build the kind of relationships that allow us  to operate effectively over the long term. Engagement Strategy We follow a clear, step-by-step strategy to make stakeholder engagement  meaningful and responsive: Mapping   Stakeholder Impact Monitoring and  Improving Categorising   and Prioritising Responding to  Expectations Engaging  through  Dialogue Our Engagement Philosophy Our approach to engagement is  structured and based on transparency,  regular feedback, and the understanding  that relationships need to be  nurtured over time. Leveraging this approach,  we aim to: Identify and  address concerns early; Build lasting relationships  based on mutual trust; Use feedback to evolve our  ESG and business priorities We identify how different groups  influence our operations and how our  actions affect them in return, whether  directly or indirectly. We regularly assess the impact of our  engagement activities to ensure they  remain relevant, timely and effective. Stakeholders are grouped  based on their influence,  interest level and relevance  to our overall value creation. Insights from these  conversations are fed into our  planning processes, project  designs, and grievance  redressal mechanisms. We maintain both formal  and informal communication  channels to listen, gather  feedback, and respond to  evolving concerns.

Governance drives    Effective Decision-making A robust framework of governance is essential to navigate regulatory  complexity, manage risks effectively and grow stakeholder confidence. At CIL, our governance model supports agile and transparent decision-making and ethical conduct, while aligning closely with  the Companies Act, SEBI’s LODR regulations, and Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) standards. This structure helps us remain  responsive, accountable and consistent in delivering long-term value in a highly regulated industry. Board Oversight and  Composition The Board of Directors oversees CIL’s  overall direction, ensures strategic  alignment, and monitors performance  and risk. Its composition reflects a  balanced mix of executive leadership,  government representation and  independent expertise. Board oversight is further reinforced  through key committees responsible  for financial controls, stakeholder  engagement, ethical conduct and  leadership appointments. These  include the Audit Committee, CSR  Committee, Nomination & Remuneration  Committee, and the Stakeholders  Relationship Committee. Governance Framework and  Policies Coal India’s governance framework is built  around policies that guide ethical business  conduct, ensure legal compliance, and  support responsible behaviour throughout  the organisation. These policies apply  to employees, contractors, and external  partners, reinforcing our values at every  level of operation. We follow established codes such as the  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,  Whistleblower Policy, and Anti-Corruption  Policy. CVC-aligned Integrity Pacts are  used in our procurement processes to  prevent conflicts of interest and ensure  transparency. Regular reviews are  conducted to keep these policies updated  and in line with international norms. Vigilance and Anti-Corruption  Measures Our vigilance function ensures compliance  and integrity across all levels of operation.  The central Vigilance Division, led by a  Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) in Kolkata,  coordinates efforts with subsidiary-level  CVOs and national agencies like the CBI  and Ministry of Coal.

Both named  and anonymous reports are accepted  and investigated impartially. The policy  is easily accessible and forms a key pillar  of our transparency efforts. Key Safeguard Non-retaliation assurance for  good-faith reporting Internal Control and Audit  Systems Our internal control environment  ensures compliance with financial  regulations, reduces operational risk,  and strengthens audit oversight. The  Audit Committee plays a vital role in  reviewing financial statements, monitoring  audit outcomes, and implementing risk- mitigation strategies. Internal controls are assessed regularly  to keep pace with statutory changes  and operational scale, helping us  maintain a high level of financial  discipline and integrity. Stakeholder Engagement and  Ethical Practices We engage proactively with  stakeholders, ensuring that our  governance approach includes  community voices, customer feedback,  and supplier accountability. Outreach  is conducted via public meetings,  helplines, and digital platforms.  All vendor contracts contain anti- corruption clauses, and we maintain  CVC-recommended Integrity Pacts in  high-value procurements. This approach ensures that our  commitment to ethical conduct extends  beyond internal processes to the broader  ecosystem in which we operate. Looking Ahead We are advancing our governance  practices with a focus on technology,  transparency, and organisational  awareness. Future efforts will include  automation of risk tracking, enhanced  ESG-linked disclosures, and company- wide ethics training. These steps are  intended to deepen our culture of  integrity and ensure preparedness for a  rapidly evolving business environment.

Chairman’s Statement Dear Stakeholders, Coal India continues to be a cornerstone  of India’s energy security, with coal  expected to retain its dominant role  in the energy mix despite the growing  presence of renewables. This underscores  both our continued relevance and the  responsibility we bear. We remain committed to sustainable  mining and meaningful community  engagement — values we’ve upheld  for decades. During the year, we  launched strategic initiatives to  strengthen our future-readiness while  keeping stakeholder well-being at the  centre of our efforts. With your continued trust and support,  we are confident in our ability to  exceed expectations and drive  responsible, long-term growth. Coal, dominant energy source  in India   Despite a gr owing push toward  cleaner energy sources, globally coal  still remains the leading source of  electricity generation. In 2024, coal  alone contributed to 35% of the  world’s total electricity generation.    In the Indian conte xt, coal’s role is  even more prominent and coal based  power generation is twice that of  the global average at 72% of the  country’s total generation. Of the  India’s total installed capacity of  475.59 GW (as of May 2025), non- fossil fuel energy sources account for  235.70 GW or nearly 50%. This is a  testimony of their rapid ascendancy  and the country’s deep commitment  to the cleaner energy. Yet, coal would  spearhead the country’s energy  march for the next two decades at  least and perhaps even beyond.    C  oal Sector has been one of the top  performers among the core sectors  as per Index of Eight Core Industries.    Wha t makes coal the preferred  fuel of choice is its abundance,  availability and affordability. Coal is  also easier to extract and transport in  bulk quantities with reliable supply.  Importantly, coal based power is  more affordable compared to other  sources. Indian Coal resources stand  at 389 Billion Tonnes (BTs) currently of  which 212 BTs are in proven category.    India ’s per capita electricity  consumption at 1395 KwH, is  still trailing the world average  and USA and China are far  ahead in consumption.    As per the Na tional Power Portal’s  fuel wise generation, coal based  electricity generation outweighs  the renewable energy (excluding  large hydro) by around five fold.  This means, if India is to catch up  with the world’s average which it  shall in future, much of the energy  required has to be met through coal  till renewable come up in bigger  and better way.       Add itionally, coal continues to  play vital role in many non-power  industries as well like cement,  fertilizers, sponge iron, aluminium  and a host of other industries.    Y our company Coal India Limited  (CIL) is at the forefront of the country’s  coal production, contributing to  around 75% of the Nation’s entire  coal output. CIL is committed to  increase the production and supplies  of the quality coal to the mandated  levels to ensure availability of  electricity at fair price.   CIL  supplies coal at highly competitive  cost compared to international  coal prices despite the increase in  various input costs, especially diesel,  explosives, and wages. At the same  time, CIL delivers healthy dividends  to its shareholders.    Apar t from its resilient presence in  energy sector, CIL also has a strong  role in the country’s economy  and social canvas.    Y our company is one of the largest  contributors to the government ex- chequer – both Central and State  – and touches lives in multiple  ways through its Corporate Social  Responsibility initiatives.

Capital We remain steadfast in boosting operational efficiency and  embracing sustainable practices, producing diverse coal  grades to power India’s expanding energy future. In recent years, we have strategically invested  in advanced equipment and infrastructure to  elevate coal production, powered by cutting-edge  technology that sets global benchmarks. Our  world-class assets drive India’s energy future with  strength and innovation. At the same time, we are actively acquiring critical  mineral assets through domestic auctions and  exploring opportunities in resource-rich countries  like Australia, Argentina, and Chile. By focusing on  lithium, graphite, and cobalt, we are spearheading  India’s sustainable transition and securing vital  materials for tomorrow’s energy landscape.

Despite  challenges such as rail congestion, shifting  demand and local disruptions, we focused  on better planning, upgraded essential  equipment, and coordinated closely with  customers and the logistics teams. Addressing the Demand  Scenario With India’s growing energy needs,  coal availability has remained a national  priority. To cater to the rising demand, we  have adopted a two-pronged strategy,  making full use of current capacity  and accelerating delivery schedules.  Stronger transport links and first-mile  automation helped efficient utilisation  of available capacity. Production and Dispatch Despite hurdles, we managed to keep  production stable and reached our  highest-ever coal offtake. This was  achieved even with rains in the second  quarter of FY2024-25 and limited  availability of rakes. Ongoing coordination  with power sector customers helped  maintain supply when demand peaked. Optimum Capacity Utilisation We managed to control costs and delay major capital spend by  using our equipment more efficiently and planning operations  better. Smarter mine schedules, improved equipment  utilisation, and quicker work cycles — aided in controlled  costs and timed CAPEX infusion. Investment in Infrastructure We kept investing in key areas to support future capacity  and smoother coal movement. A large part of the spending  was directed towards First Mile Connectivity projects, high- capacity mining equipment, and expanding railway networks  to lay foundation of future growth.

CIL’s Occupational Health and Safety  Policy applies across all subsidiaries and is  overseen by an Internal Safety Organisation  (ISO). This framework ensures that both  legal and operational safety standards are  consistently upheld. Safety Training Training in safety is built into the core  of daily operations. These sessions help  employees stay alert to their surroundings  and improve safety during operations. Main programmes include:   Basic and r efresher safety training   P ractical on job training   Simula tor-based training for Heavy Earth  Moving Machinery (HEMM) operators Inspections and Audits To spot and manage hazards, regular  safety checks are carried out by trained  staff across different units. Safety audits  happen at all active mining sites to  ensure rules are being followed. CIL uses  online portals for safety inspection and  audits, which helps in keeping records  of how things are going and where  improvements are needed. Risk-Based Safety Management Our approach to handle safety  risks in operations:   Safety Management Plans   (SMPs) are created using site- specific risk evaluations   P rincipal Hazard Management Plans  (PHMPs) to prevent serious incidents   S tandard Operating Procedures (SOPs)  based on changes in mining conditions   T oolbox safety meetings held before  each shift to go over possible risks   Individual safety discussions and   employee support programmes to  help staff dealing with safety matters   Emer gency Response and Evacuation  Plan (EREP) for safe evacuation  during emergencies Safety training at subsidiaries Human Capital Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Our workforce comprises people from  different regions, languages and cultural  backgrounds. Inclusion is not treated as  a separate initiative. It forms a part of  how people are hired, trained, involved  and supported. The aim is to maintain  fairness in the workplace, protect  personnel through clear policies, and  provide openings for groups that are  marginalised and historically had very  few opportunities. Our approach to Diversity, Equity,  and Inclusion relies on systems and  procedures such as legal compliance,  specific training, internal checks and  fair hiring practices. These systems are  used throughout all subsidiaries and are  reviewed periodically. Gender Representation and  Workplace Support The number of women working at  CIL in technical, supervisory and  administrative positions is increasing.

Natural Capital Environmental Monitoring We have embedded a company-wide  digital and on-ground environmental  monitoring architecture that enables  dynamic response, preventive action and  sustained compliance. This architecture  spans our entire mining footprint,  from underground mines and surface  operations to processing plants, transport  corridors and township zones.  Key pillars of our environmental  monitoring landscape include Methanometers, Carbon Monoxide  (CO) detectors and multi-sensor  instruments continuously assess  underground and surface atmospheric  conditions. These systems ensure miner  safety by providing early warnings of  hazardous concentrations. Noise levels are measured in decibels  using portable and fixed-location devices  during daytime and nighttime periods.  The data helps enforce safe zones and  guides green belt development in  sensitive zones like schools, hospitals  and residential areas. Advanced environmental tele-monitoring  systems and gas chromatographs are used  for deeper chemical and gas analyses,  particularly in underground mines and  workshops. These allow detection of  complex air pollutants and enable  continuous environmental profiling. Weather parameters such as wind speed,  humidity, rainfall and temperature are  monitored in tandem with air quality.  This supports predictive dust dispersion  modelling and better deployment  of control systems. Personal Dust Samplers (PDS) are  deployed across key work zones. In  parallel, we use mobile dust monitoring  units, stationary analyzers and dust  mapping tools to assess PM10 levels  and initiate timely interventions.  Real-time particulate data informs  our dust suppression operations,  such as deployment of fog cannons  and water sprinklers. A network of 111 Continuous Ambient Air  Quality Monitoring Systems (CAAQMS)  captures real-time data on PM2.5,  PM10, SOx, NOx and CO. These are  strategically placed across mine lease  areas, coal handling points and nearby  habitations. The data is automatically  linked to the Central Pollution Control  Board (CPCB) and State Pollution  Control Boards (SPCBs). Multi-gas detection systems Noise pollution tracking ETMS and Gas Chromatography Meteorological integration Dust monitoring infrastructure Ambient air quality surveillance 01 04 A corporate-level environmental  monitoring dashboard aggregates  field data, enabling pattern detection,  predictive alerts and prioritised action.

F orward Integration into Coal-to-Chemical  Projects:     CIL  continues to prioritize coal gasification as a key  enabler for cleaner and value-added utilization of  domestic coal. This strategic initiative aligns with the  Government of India’s Vision to gasify 100 million  tonnes (MT) of coal by 2030, aiming to reduce  import dependency on natural gas and crude oil,  while promoting alternative energy solutions.     T o advance this vision, CIL has formed two joint  venture companies, Bharat Coal Gasification  and Chemicals Limited (BCGCL) and Coal Gas  India Limited (CGIL) with two major public sector  enterprises Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL)  and GAIL (India) Limited respectively in the both JVs  CIL holds 51% of equity shareholding. In addition to  JVs, CIL has also planned one Coal to SNG project  in Maharashtra for which an MOU has also been  signed with BPCL to jointly take up the project  and JV will be formed after finalisation of DPR.  CIL  has earmarked a capital investment of  H  37050  crore over the coming years to develop these coal  gasification projects in India.     BC GCL was incorporated on 21.05.2024 with an  authorised share capital of  H  11 Crores and a paid- up capital of  H  1.0 Lakh. The company’s objective  is to establish a coal-to-ammonium nitrate project  in Odisha with an annual capacity of 0.66 million  tonnes per annum (MTPA) of ammonium nitrate.  The project has been divided into four main LSTK  packages, which include the gasification section,  gas purification, ammonia synthesis, nitric acid  synthesis, and ammonium nitrate synthesis. The Firm  Offer for two LSTK-1 has been submitted by BHEL,  and bids against the tenders for LSTK-2, LSTK-3  and LSTK-4 are expected to be submitted by June  2025. The project will foster the self-reliance and  Atmanirbhar Abhiyaan of the Government of India  by employing indigenous gasification technology to  convert coal to ammonium nitrate.     T he other JV, CGIL with GAIL was also incorporated  on 25.03.2025 to develop a coal-to-synthetic natural  gas (SNG) project in West Bengal with an annual  capacity of 633.6 Million Nm3 of SNG. The project  is being developed on LSTK modes for which two  main LSTK packages have been identified by the  Project Management Consultant of this project. To  minimize the uncertainty in the project, shortlisting  of technology licensors for gasification is under  finalization. NDA with M/s Johnson Matthey was  signed to exchange the details for the Methanation  section of the plant. This plant will convert coal  into cleaner gaseous fuel, offering a sustainable  substitute for imported natural gas and promoting  environmental stewardship.      It is widely r ecognized that the coal gasification  project associates with technological challenges  due to high-ash coal being available in the country.  To overcome these challenges, the Government of  India has launched several initiatives to promote  the gasification projects by providing financial  support. CIL’s all three coal gasification projects  have been selected under the financial scheme, and  subsequently, the agreements with the Ministry of  Coal were signed for all three projects, under which  each project will receive the financial support of    H  1350 crores from GoI in due course of development.      In addition to C entral Government support, the  High Level Clearance Authority of the Government  of Odisha has granted in-principle approval to the  BCGCL project and subsequently, an MoU was  signed with the Government of Odisha to facilitate  early Implementation of the project. These steps  are intended to facilitate and provide a variety of  incentives to develop the coal-to-ammonium-nitrate  project in Odisha.   D .   V enturing into Critical Minerals Value Chain:     As the global economy shif ts away from fossil fuels,  the demand for critical minerals—such as lithium,  cobalt, nickel, graphite, and rare earth elements— is expected to surge. These minerals are vital  for the production of batteries, electronics, and  clean energy technologies, thereby opening up  significant business opportunities across the critical  mineral value chain.     In alignment with the worldwide tr ansition  to renewable energy and advanced clean  technologies, CIL is strategically diversifying into  this emerging sector as part of its broader effort to  explore new revenue streams by including business  activities related to the critical minerals value  chain. Leveraging its robust mining experience  and infrastructure, CIL aims to tap into the growing  market for critical minerals, enabling sustainable  growth while also mitigating risks associated with  a potential decline in coal demand. This strategic  initiative also supports India’s objective of achieving  self-reliance in critical minerals, reducing import  dependency, and enhancing national security.     CIL  plans to engage in various segments of the  critical minerals value chain through standalone  ventures or strategic collaborations: 	  Mining of critical minerals 	  Midstream and downstream processing 	  Establishment of end-product  manufacturing facilities     Additionally , CIL is actively seeking partnerships in  the research and development domain to innovate  and improve technologies for more efficient  exploration, mining, processing, and recycling  of critical minerals. These efforts are aimed at  facilitating the development of a commercial-scale  processing facility once suitable assets are secured.     Curr ently, CIL is involved in identifying and evaluating  opportunities to acquire critical mineral assets both  domestically and internationally. Within India, the  company has been participating in government- led auctions and recently emerged as the preferred  bidder for the Khattali Chotti Graphite block in the  Tranche II of the Critical Minerals e-Auction. On the  international front, CIL has signed non-disclosure  agreements with foreign asset owners and is in  the process of assessing those opportunities for  strategic interest.   E.

VIGILANCE DIVISION    C  oal India Ltd. operates a meticulously organized  Vigilance Division located at its Corporate HQ in Kolkata,  led by a Chief Vigilance Officer and supported by a  diverse team of vigilance officers. Similarly, its eight  subsidiaries have their independent Vigilance Units, each  headed by a CVO. At the level of holding company, CVO,  CIL acts as a coordinating authority between subsidiary  Vigilance, CBI, Ministry of Coal and the Central Vigilance  Commission. CVO, CIL at corporate level deals with  complaints, investigations and systemic improvements  on issues having multi-subsidiary and company-wide  ramifications. Complaints received within the organization  are addressed in alignment with CIL's "Complaint  Handling Policy" and the guidelines established by the  CVC. These are processed using the Online Complaint  Handling Portal from the point of receipt until resolution.  As part of preventive vigilance efforts, CIL's vigilance  division conducts System Studies on various business  processes with operational and financial implications,  proposing specific system improvement suggestions  for management. Below are some of the System  Improvement Measures (SIMs) implemented during the  fiscal year 2024-25: a.   Aler t Generation in SAP /ERP for Sensitive Posting:    As per pr ovisions of HR Manual of CIL, all officials posted  in sensitive position should be rotated/ transferred  after completion of the stipulated tenure. Prevalent  practice involves the identification and tracking of tenure  completion for officials posted at sensitive positions at  CIL and subsidiary companies manually. This manual  process increases the likelihood of human error and  makes it difficult to streamline the records. Since CIL &  Subsidiary companies have already migrated to ERP,  it was suggested to implement an automated alert  generation system regarding sensitive posting periods  through the SAP/ ERP (HR) module across CIL and  its subsidiaries. For better use of IT, and to enhance  transparency, System Improvement Measures (SIM) were  suggested for uniform implementation across CIL and  its subsidiaries which includes - Mapping of all sensitive  posts of executives and non- executives in the ERP by  all units/areas/subsidiaries by designated officers in  line with relevant circular of CIL and any other circulars  issued by CIL from time to time in respect of sensitive  posting, Regular updating of records and information  regarding the transfer, posting, and joining of officials in  the ERP system shall be carried out, Generation of alerts  for tenure completion in sensitive posts on periodic basis  and placement before Competent Authority for decision.  Job rotation of officials has to be done in a periodic  manner based on alerts generated. b.   Inven tory Management of Spares / Parts of P&M  including Pumps   Suggested  for Inventory management of P&M spares/ parts, including pumps, through improved record-keeping  (physical/digital) and regular auditing of procured and  consumed stock. These included that the relevant details  of all Plant & Machinery (P&M) items including Pumps  used for de- watering in the mines, should be entered  in the Asset Register duly maintained for that purpose  in physical/digital form, Proper inventory management  by way of record keeping of the spares procured and  consumed to be ensured and Log books should be  maintained at unit level for all P&M items including pumps.  Details of all repairs including day to day consumption of  spares/consumables should be entered in the log books  with proper authentication by concerned officials. Further,  Periodic audit of consumption of spares against each P&M  item should be ensured at appropriate level to assess the  cost of maintaining the assets vis-à-vis cost of replacement.  Focused planning and review should be ensured for Asset  Life Cycle Management of all P&M items.  c.   P assing of Bills   R egarding delayed payment after the submission of  final bills, the Systemic Improvement Measures were  suggested for passing of bills. These included record  keeping for internal (table-to-table) movement of bills  within the department needs to be put in place in the form  of Standard operating Procedure (SOP), all bills should be  processed under a uniform criterion such as the First-In- First-Out (FIFO) method. Any deviation from this process  may be allowed only with approval from the competent  authority. To allow such exceptions, clear-cut guidelines  should be issued to ensure consistent decision-making.  Proper maintenance of records at various stages of Bill  processing should be ensured. The implementation of bill  tracking system through ERP should be followed. Since,  CIL & subsidiary companies have already migrated to ERP/ SAP, modules like Vendor Invoice Management (VIM) may  be used to handle the receipt, processing, and paperless  payment. Additionally, a review of relevant provisions in  the Civil Manual of CIL is recommended, particularly those  concerning delays in the acceptance of measurements by  contractors, to facilitate time-bound processing of bills. d.   Manual of  Civil Engineering Works of CIL   All the of ficial documents viz. Measurement Books, Site  order Books, Hindrance Register etc. pertaining to a  contract which are under the custody of the official (who  is transferred or is superannuating) must be handed  over to the EIC/Designated Officer before their release/ superannuation. It will be responsibility of the concerned  EIC/Designated officer to undertake the efforts for safe  custody of these documents without any alteration.    C  omplaint Handling:  During the year 2024-25, CIL  Vigilance Division received 575 complaints including  those forwarded by MoC, CBI and CVC, out of which 572  complaints have been disposed during the year.   P unitive Vigilance:  The Vigilance Units of CIL and its  subsidiaries undertook numerous intensive examinations,  surprise checks and investigations leading to punitive  actions on 224 officials during the year.   Observance  of Vigilance Awareness Week (VAW)–2024:   In the ye ar 2024, Vigilance Awareness Week was observed  from 28 th  October to 3 th  November, 2024 on the theme  “Culture of Integrity for Nation’s Prosperity”.   T he observance of VAW was preceded by a special  campaign during the period 16 th  August 2024 till 15 th   November, 2024 as a prelude to Vigilance Awareness  Week 2024 on Preventive Vigilance as circulated by  CVC vide Circular No. 08/08/24, dated 01.08.2024  with six focus areas, namely; Capacity Building  Program, Identification and implementation of Systemic  Improvement measures, Up-dation of Circulars /  Guidelines, Disposal of complaints received before  30.06.2024 and Dynamic Digital Presence.

Management’s Explanation to Final Comments issued by C&AG's  on Consolidated Financial Statements for FY 2024-25  AQ  No.   C&AG observation   Management Explanation 1 A.    C  omment on Financial Position  A1. Statement of Profit and Loss  Other current liabilities (Note-10.2)  J  29,494.17 crore  Above does not include an amount of  H  364.44 crore payable  to the Mineral Area Development Authority (MADA), Urban  Development Department, Government of Jharkhand. Urban Development Department, Government of Jharkhand,  vide notification (January 2006) imposed a levy of 1 per cent  fee on the sale value of the coal and coke. As per the said  notification, MADA was the authorized agency to collect the  same in respect of the notified areas. The levy, so imposed,  was challenged by CCL in the Jharkhand High Court.  Accordingly, CCL has shown  H  364.44 crore for the period of  2005-06 to 2022-23 as Contingent Liability. CCL is paying the  said fee from financial year 2023-24 onwards. Hon’ble Supreme Court Judgment dated 25.07.2024 related  to State’s power to tax mines and mineral Rights, clarified that  States may levy or renew demands of tax. The demand of tax  shall not operate on transactions made prior to 1 April 2005.  Further, the Hon’ble Supreme court has rejected the submission  regarding applicability of MADA with prospective effect. Despite the above judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,  CCL has shown the amount of  H  364.44 crore as Contingent  Liability and has not recognized the amount as liability. As per Ind AS-37, Para 14 of Provisions, Contingent Liabilities,  and Contingent Assets a provision shall be recognized when  an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive)  as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefits would be required  to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made  of the amount of the obligation. Thus, non-recognition of the above amount as liability despite  the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court has resulted in  understatement of other current liability and expenditure and  overstatement of profit for the year by  H  364.44 crore. A levy in the form of a percentage fee on the sale value is  currently applicable and is being duly paid by CCL from  FY 2023–24 onwards. However, the liability pertaining to  the earlier period (FY 2005–06 to FY 2022–23) has been  challenged by CCL before the Hon’ble High Court and  remains sub-judice. As per Paragraph 14 of Ind AS 37, a provision shall be  recognized only when there exists a present obligation  (legal or constructive) arising from a past event, it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be  made. In the present case, since the matter is under active  litigation and the existence of a present obligation for the  past period has not been legally established, the conditions  for recognizing a provision are not satisfied. Accordingly, the disclosure of the amount as a contingent  liability is considered appropriate and has been made in  compliance with Ind AS 37.  The above contingent liability is included in the total  amount of contingent liability disclosed in note 16.1.a of  consolidated financial statements. 2 B.1    C  omments on Disclosure  Additional Notes to the Financial Statements (Note-16)  Contingent Liabilities  J  48047.53 crore Mahanadi Coalfields Limited has mining operation in the  State of Odisha. Government of Odisha imposed levy at the  rate of 15 per cent of annual value of coal in the year 2004- 05 under the Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio-Economic  Development Act, 2004. The Act was challenged before the  Orissa High Court by MCL, raising a question of law regarding  the legislative competence and validity of imposing such a  tax. Orissa High court (05.12.2005) struck down the ORISED  Act, which was challenged before the Supreme Court of India  by Government of Orissa, which is still pending. Supreme Court vide judgments dated 25 July 2024 and 14  August 2024 in MADA vs. SAIL clarified (i) States may levy or  renew demands of tax, retrospectively for transactions since  1.04.2005; (ii) any tax demands, if raised by States, shall be  recovered in 12 annual instalments starting from 01.04.2026;  and (iii) interest and penalty for periods before 25.07.2024  are expressly waived. The observation regarding potential future liability arising  from the rights conferred on State Governments pursuant to  the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgments in MADA & Ors. v.  SAIL & Ors. does not warrant recognition of a liability in the  financial statements, as there exists no present obligation— legal or constructive—arising from a past event. As noted in the observation itself, the validity of the Orissa  Rural Infrastructure and Socio-Economic Development  (ORISED) Act, 2004 remains under judicial consideration  by a three-judge bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,  following its quashing by the Hon’ble Orissa High Court on  05.12.2005. To date, the Government of Odisha has neither  enacted a new legislation nor revived the said Act, and no  demand has been raised against MCL in this regard. As per Paragraph 10 of Ind AS 37, a contingent liability exists  only where there is a possible obligation arising from past  events, the outcome of which depends on uncertain future  events not wholly within the control of the entity, or where a  present obligation exists but does not meet the recognition  criteria. In the present case, neither a demand has been  raised nor has any enforceable obligation arisen. AQ  No.   C&AG observation   Management Explanation Consequent to the judgement, State Government have  been conferred with the rights of additional levy or renewal  of demands. Orissa Government has not notified any new  Act till date, but possibility of a new Act or revival of old Act  with possibility of demands in future cannot be ruled out.  Legal Department of Coal India Limited has worked out the  possible outflows arising out of the above judgment, which  worked out at  H  31227.80 crore. As per Para 10 of IND AS 37, contingent liability is: (a) a  possible obligation that arises from past events and whose  existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly  within the control of the entity; or (b) present obligation that  arises from past events but is not recognised because: (i) it  is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;  or (ii) Amount of the obligation cannot be measured with  sufficient reliability. Consequent to the judgement, possibility of a new Act or  revival of old Act with possibility of demands in future cannot  be ruled out. Thus, need to be disclosed as Contingent  Liability. This resulted in deficiency in disclosure requirements. Any provision based solely on the assumption that the  Supreme Court may uphold the ORISED Act and The State  Government may subsequently raise a demand, would  be purely speculative. Such a scenario does not meet the  conditions for recognition of either a liability or a contingent  liability under Ind AS 37. Accordingly, the disclosure in Note 16.1.a.I.iii of  consolidated financial statements is in compliance with the  relevant guidance under Ind AS Schedule III and does not  result in any deficiency in the presentation of the financial  statements. 3. B.2 Additional Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  (Note-16 )  Other commitment  H  2009.86 crore With regard to other commitment: MCL has not disclosed the details towards amount of   H  35514.50 crore towards contractual commitment for the  work relating to Mine Development and Operation (MDO)  of Siarmal OCP awarded to Dilip Buildcon Limited to be  executed in Mahalaxmi Area. The above include  H  20.58 crore towards operation and  maintenance of plant and substation after commissioning  during the defect liability period in respect of different  contractual works awarded at Wani Area of WCL. Since  contractual commitments towards operation and  maintenance are in the nature of revenue, these should have  been included under other commitments instead of Capital  Commitments. CMPDIL has not disclosed details towards amount remaining  to be executed on account of various revenue contractual  works of  H  517.21 crore. Paragraph 114 (d) of Ind AS-1 on Presentation of Financial  Statements states that any entity shall disclose, inter alia, other  disclosure including unrecognized contractual commitments This resulted in understatement of other commitments by    H  36052.29 crore. Non-disclosure of the above facts resulted  in deficiency in disclosure requirements of IND AS-1. Point No. 8.2.14.6 of the Guidance Note on Division II –  Ind AS Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 states the  following: “Accordingly, the disclosures required to be made for ‘Other  Commitments’ should include only those non-cancellable  contractual commitments (i.e., cancellation of which will  result in a penalty disproportionate to the benefits involved)  based on the professional judgment of the management,  which are material and relevant in understanding the  financial statements of the company and impact the  decision-making of the users of financial statements.  Examples may include commitments in the nature of buy- back arrangements, commitments to fund subsidiaries and  associates, non-disposal of investments in subsidiaries and  undertakings, derivative-related commitments, etc.” In view of the above, the Mine Development and Operation  (MDO) contract in the case of MCL and revenue contracts  in the case of CMPDIL do not meet the criteria for separate  disclosure under “Other Commitments.” These contracts  are cancellable in nature or do not involve disproportionate  penalties on cancellation and hence do not fall within the  definition of non-cancellable contractual commitments  requiring disclosure under Ind AS 1. With respect to WCL, the work order was primarily issued  for capital works, which also included clauses related to  operation and maintenance activities. Since the contract  was fundamentally capital in nature, the entire commitment  has been disclosed under Capital Commitments, which is  considered appropriate. Accordingly, the current classification and disclosure of  commitments are in compliance with the relevant guidance  under Ind AS Schedule III and do not result in any deficiency  in financial statement presentation.

Sub: Management Reply to the observations made in the Secretarial Audit Report for FY 2024-25.  S.  No   Observations of Secretarial Auditor   Management Explanation 1. The Audit Committee does not meet the prescribed  number of Independent Directors as required by Chapter  4 of the Guidelines on Corporate Governance for CPSE. During the Audit period, the composition of Audit Committee  was not as per Clause 4.1.1 of DPE Guidelines on Corporate  Governance for CPSE. This is due to the fact that out of the total  requirement of 04 (four) Nos. of Independent Directors, there  were only 02 (two) Nos. of Independent Directors on the Board  of SECL for most part of the year; and appointment of 02 (two)  more Independent Directors is still awaited from Ministry of  Coal (MoC)/ Govt. of India. 2. The number of Functional Directors, including the CMD/ MD, exceeds fifty percent of the Board’s total strength,  contrary to the requirement under Chapter 3 of the  Guidelines on Corporate Governance for CPSE. In terms of MoC letter dated 06.06.2008, the Board of Directors  of SECL is constituted with 11 Directors including 05 Whole- Time Functional Directors (incl. CMD/MD), 02 Part-Time Official  Directors (Government Nominees) & 04 Part-Time Non-Official  Directors (Independent Directors), who are appointed by  the Government of India, Ministry of Coal. In addition to this,  Government has nominated a representative from SECR as a  Permanent Invitee on the Board of SECL. At present, there are only 02 (two) Nos. of Independent  Directors on the Board of SECL out of total requirement of 04  (four) Nos.; and appointment of 02 (two) more Independent  Directors is still awaited from Ministry of Coal (MoC)/ Govt. of  India. 3. The Company has not constituted a Remuneration  Committee, as mandated under Chapter 5 of the  Guidelines on Corporate Governance for CPSE. As per Clause 5.1 of DPE Guidelines on Corporate Governance  for CPSE, the scope of Remuneration Committee include  deciding the annual bonus/ variable pay pool and policy  for its distribution across the executives and non unionized  supervisors. However, SECL being a wholly owned Subsidiary  of Coal India Limited, such powers vest with Coal India Limited  (the Holding Company).  Accordingly, Coal India Limited (the Holding Company) has  constituted the Remuneration Committee for all its Subsidiaries.  The Remuneration of Directors/ Officers, however, is decided  by Government of India.  4. The Company has not complied with the requirement  of appointing at least one Woman Director as stipulated  under Section 149(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013. During the Audit period, there was no Woman Director on the  Board of SECL and appointment of the same is still awaited  from Ministry of Coal (MoC)/ Govt. of India.

Annexure 20 Technological Absorption, Research & Development (R&D) 1.   Specific ar ea in which R&D carried out   Govt.  of India through its Coal Science & Technology  (S&T) Plan and Coal India Limited (CIL) through its R&D  Board have been promoting R&D activities in Coal  & Lignite Sectors for improvement of production &  productivity from underground mining and opencast  mining, improvement of safety, health & environment,  creation of wealth from waste , alternative use of coal and  clean coal technologies, coal beneficiation & utilization,  exploration, innovation and indigenisation (under Make  in India concept) and allied fields. Substantial funds are  being earmarked annually by Ministry of Coal and CIL R&D  Board to carry out research work on the above subjects.    CMPDI has established Na tional Centre for Coal and  Energy Research (NaCCER)- Phase-1 at CMPDI campus,  Ranchi, which was inaugurated by Hon’ble Minister  of Coal on 07.10.2024 for carrying out research in  domains of coal and energy sector to sustainably meet  the energy demand of the nation through cutting edge  research, innovation and collaboration. NaCCER played  a key role in Coal India Limited signing Memorandum  of Understanding (MoU) with IIT-Hyderabad and IIT  (ISM), Dhanbad. 2.   Benefits derived fr om R&D activities in coal  and lignite sectors    Notable advances have been made thr ough R&D efforts  in coal exploration techniques  	  Introduction of mining methods like “blasting  gallery and cable bolting” for recovery of coal in  thick seams and shortwall mining at SECL. 	  “Controlled blasting” for removal of overburden  rocks and coal in opencast mines as close as to 50m  from surface structures successfully. 	  Rock Mass Rating (RMR) developed under R&D  is now being used for designing support in  underground mines.  	  Applying new technique using Airborne Laser  Terrain Mapper and ground based Terrestrial Laser  Scanner (TLS) for OB measurement. 	  To ensure the safety and to protect loss of equipment  in opencast mines, Dumper Collision Avoidance  System (DCAS) has been developed indigenously  and was successfully undertaken at KDH opencast  mine of Central Coalfields Limited (CCL).  	  Self-advancing goaf edge (mobile) chock type  supports have been indigenously developed and  their field trial conducted successfully at Bastacola  mine of BCCL [in coal roof] and RK-7 mine of SCCL  [shale/ sand stone roof].  	  Introduction of modern technique like  Ground Penetrating Radar for detection of old  unapproachable water logged workings.  	  The solar photovoltaic plant has been erected and  commissioned on the roof tops of CMPDI office  buildings. The total installed capacity of the plant  is 190 kW. This project reduces carbon footprint &  maximizes renewable energy system. 	  Under techno-economic efficacy for ANFO  explosive, with low density, porous, thermally  stabilised, Prilled Ammonium Nitrate in CIL mines,  vis-à-vis other conventional explosives in terms  of Powder Factor (PF), post blast analysis etc. has  been established. From the above study, it was  found that fragmentation using ANFO is better and  cost effective in comparison to other explosives  in dry condition. 	  Under project “Requirement of air in mine for Mass  Production Technology’ complete ventilation studies  were conducted in Continuous Miner operated  mines and Longwall mines and based on analysis a  norms relating to minimum air quantity framed in CM  panels, as it was not practicable to provide stipulated  air quantity at the Last Ventilation Connection (LVC)  in mass production panels as per Regulation 153  {2(a)} of CMR-2017 as it pose problems of high  dust generation and high water gauge in the main  mechanical ventilator of the mine. As an outcome  of this project, DGMS issued DGMS (Tech.)(S&T)  Circular no. 02, Dhanbad dated 11.04.2025 related  to Guidelines on minimum air quantity required at  Continuous miner and Longwall panels. 	  Development of guidelines for design of all tiers  of shovel-dumper dump above dragline dump,  with delineation of phreatic surface, within dragline  dump throughout the year and validation study  on two dragline mines of Coal India Limited (CIL).  Based on the study, a general guideline has been  developed relating to maximum height, slope of  dragline and shovel dumper dump.  	  Under the project “Restoration of Orchid flora of  Makum Coalfield areas of Digboi Forest Division”,  fifteen hundred seedlings are multiplied and  planted in re-vegetated mined out sites, nearby  forest site and RFRI botanical garden with exhaustive  care. Conservation and maintenance of orchid  species were done at RFRI botanical garden and  Tikak Colliery.  	  Bench Scale Study on reducing ash content (mineral  matter) from Washery Grade Coking coal and high  ash non-coking coal through oil agglomeration.  Coal-Oil Agglomeration unit fabricated, installed  and commissioned at NML laboratory, Jamshedpur  using three types of oils i.e. sunflower oil, castor oil  and pine oil for reducing the ash content of coal.  Coking coal with sunflower oil shows encouraging  results (Topa Coal: Ash %age reduced to 9% from  21% with 84% yield, Rajrappa Coal: Ash %age  reduced to 20% from 34% with 80% yield). 	  Development of Guidelines for Increasing the  Height of Overburden Dumps at Opencast Coal  Mines in India. Design and developed a Large- Scale Direct Shear Testing Machine at CMPDI for  testing of representative OB dump samples from  Opencast Coal mines. Steeper bench angles up to  40° and external dump height up to 120m can be  considered safe based on the strength properties  of OB material, in comparison to present Coal Mine  Regulation 2017 which limits the individual bench  angle to 37.5° and external dump heights up to 90m.  	  Capacity Building for extraction of CMM Resource  within CIL Command Areas (CMPDI & CSIRO,  Australia). CMPDI has developed a State-of-Art  Laboratory facility for understanding of CBM/ CMM resources in India to assist in unconventional  gas resources extraction. Project outcome will be  helpful in development of CBM/CMM in CIL & other  leasehold areas. 	  Under a project, the effect of blasting on opencast  mine dump was investigated and prediction  model of FOS for stability of the OB dump slope  was recommended considering various uncertain  material parameters under blast loading with  different explosive densities and distances of the  blasting point. 	  Under a project, a VOD measurement system  was developed which can measure velocity of  detonation of in-the-hole explosive as well as  cartridges, booster and other accessories on the  surface. The system uses fiber optic cables for high  accuracy measurement. The instrument cannot be  initiated without the authorization of the user, hence  authenticity of the measurement and security of the  tested explosives and accessories are guaranteed.  The device is developed indigenously keeping the  spirit of “Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan” or “Make in  India” concept.

(Civil) No. 16-21 of 2023, CIL vs. CCI a)   Name of  the Authority:  Supreme Court b)   Brief  of the Case:  Allegations of abuse of dominance and  unfair and discriminatory conduct by CIL and WCL by: (i)  delaying FSA execution; and (ii) forcing the Informant to  enter into one-sided anti-competitive Cost Plus FSAs.    C  CI held that CIL / subsidiaries were dominant in relevant  market by virtue of the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act,  1973 and policy scheme, among other factors.   On 05.12.2014,  CIL filed an appeal along with an IA before  the erstwhile COMPAT for stay of the CCI’s direction.  COMPAT heard the matter during Mar’ 15 and Oct-Nov’  15, and vide Order dated 09.12.2016, upheld CCI’s  Order. CIL and WCL appealed against the COMPAT’s  Order before Supreme Court.   Having noted tha t various appeals on similar issues  involving CIL are pending before NCLAT, the Bench orally  directed that CIL file a transfer petition, seeking transfer of  the appeals pending before the NCLAT to the Supreme  Court. Accordingly, a transfer petition was filed by CIL. On  22.03.2023, the Supreme Court ordered / allowed the  transfer of the cases before NCLAT to the Supreme Court.   T he Supreme Court vide judgment dated 15.06.2023,  disposed of the IA for additional grounds (i.e., CIL’s  argument that the Competition Act does not apply to CIL)  and the Transfer Petition. The Supreme Court held that the  Competition Act applies to CIL / subsidiaries but clarified  that CIL will be entitled to take any defenses available  under the law to demonstrate that it has not abused its  dominant position. The Supreme Court ordered that CIL’s  appeal in the SWPL matter will be decided on merits and  also that all the cases transferred from NCLAT to Supreme  Court (by way of the transfer petition) be sent back to be  decided on their own merits.   T his matter is next listed for hearing on 24.07.2025.  Case No. 2:  C.A No. 5697 of 2017, CIL v. CCI and Bijay Poddar a)   Name of  the Authority:  Supreme Court b)   Brief  of the Case:  An information was filed alleging that  CIL abused its dominance in relation to the terms and  conditions for imposing non-reciprocal EMD under ‘Spot  e-auction’ scheme making the scheme arbitrary since it  imposed a penalty on bidders who failed to offer full or  part of the successful bid, but not on CIL if they failed  to supply coal.    C  CI passed an order against CIL stating that this  amounted to CIL having abused its dominant position.  CIL filed an appeal against the CCI’s order before the  erstwhile COMPAT which, vide Order dated 20.03.2017,  dismissed CIL’s appeal and directed CIL to modify terms  of Spot e-auction scheme. CIL filed an Appeal before  Supreme Court against the COMPAT’s said order.   T he Supreme Court vide Order dated 05.05.2017 granted  a stay on COMPAT’s Order. Respondents filed their reply  to CIL’s appeal and CIL has also filed its rejoinder.   On 18.02.2019,  Mr. P. S. Narasimha on behalf of CIL,  informed the Supreme Court that certain issues of  constitutional importance were pending before Supreme  Court in Civil Appeal No. 2845/2017 (Sai Wardha matter)  and the outcome of the same would impact this case as  well. The bench adjourned the matter.   On 09.08.2023,  the Respondent moved a letter to  mention the matter orally before the Supreme Court as  the matter had been pending for several years. Thereafter  the matter has been listed for regular hearing 10.10.2023  onwards – however, due to paucity of time it has not  been taken up.    T he matter was directed to be listed for hearing in April  2025. However, it has not come up in any cause list so far.  Case No. 3:  Competition Appeal (AT) No. 1-3 of 2017  (Case No. 3, 11 & 59 of 2012 before CCI) CIL & Ors. vs.  CCI, Mahagenco & GSECL a)   Name of  the Authority:  NCLAT b)   Brief  of the Case:  This case originated from 3 separate  Information(s) filed by Mahagenco & GSECL alleging  CIL and some of its subsidiaries of abuse of dominance,  imposition of unfair / discriminatory conditions in FSA  provisions relating to grade spillage, sampling, supply of  ungraded coal, compensation for stones / oversized coal,  termination, Force Majeure conditions, etc. without any  bilateral discussions with TPPs.    C  CI vide Order dated 09.12.2013, imposed a penalty of  H  1773 Crores on CIL which filed an appeal before the  erstwhile COMPAT. One of CIL’s contentions was that  principles of natural justice had not been adhered to and  the CCI members who decided the matter were not the  same as those who heard the arguments. Accordingly,  re-hearings took place on 17.05.2016 before CCI which  passed Order dated 24.03.2017 with similar findings as  in the Order dated 09.12.2013. Considering the changes  made to sampling and other clauses in FSA and the  Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 328 329 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

constraints imposed by various ministries upon CIL, CCI  reduced the penalty to  H  591 crores.   CIL  filed an appeal against CCI’s fresh order before  NCLAT. Stay has been granted on operation of the Order.  The opposite parties have filed replies to the appeal and  rejoinders have been filed by CIL.

C  CI decided that CIL abused its dominant position  in drafting and finalizing of FSAs, grade declaration /  review, supplies through MOUs, DDQ and supply of  ungraded coal. However, no penalty was imposed since  it had already been imposed in Mahagenco case. CIL  filed an appeal before the erstwhile COMPAT which was  tagged with Mahagenco appeal. Matter was re-heard  by CCI in 2016.   In  Apr’ 17, CCI passed Order re-iterating its previous  findings and observations and relying heavily on  Mahagenco Order. No penalty was imposed in this Order  as well. CIL filed an appeal against this decision which is  pending before NCLAT.   With r espect to Case No. 8 of 2014, an Information was  filed by GHCL against CIL and WCL.

Owing to pendency of  transfer petition before Supreme  Court, a stay on these proceedings was ordered by the  Supreme Court. NCLAT has been informed about the stay  granted by Supreme Court.   As Supr eme Court vide judgment dated 15.06.2023  directed that the case be transferred back to NCLAT to  be decided on merits.    In C ompetition Appeal (AT) No. 11 of 2017, CIL filed the  IAs 5256-5258 of 2024 and 5311 of 2024 on 19.07.2024,  seeking to raise additional grounds for the NCLAT to  consider the AMRCD Guidelines, for the resolution of  the current dispute.

KPCL filed an appeal against CCI’s decision which  is pending before NCLAT.   Owing to pendency of  transfer petition before Supreme  Court, a stay on these proceedings has been ordered by  the Supreme Court. NCLAT has been informed about the  stay granted by Supreme Court.   As Supr eme Court vide judgment dated 15.06.2023  directed that the case be transferred back to NCLAT  to be decided on merits. This next date of hearing  is not updated.  Case No. 6:  CA. No. 2 of 2015 (TA (AT) No. 01 of 2017)  (SWPL v. CIL & Ors) a)   Name of  the Authority:  NLCAT b)   Brief  of the Case:  Claim of compensation filed by  SWPL against WCL/CIL arising out of CCI and COMPAT’s  Orders returning a finding of abuse of dominance  against CIL on account of delay in FSA execution, faulty  pricing mechanism, inferior quality of coal supplied, costs  related to bank guarantees and refunds for performance  incentives already paid to CIL.

Management  Discussion  and Analysis  Report              

Management Discussion and Analysis Report               1.0   INDUS TRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT     C  oal in India and Coal India Limited    C  oal continues to be India’s most significant indigenous  energy resource, serving as a cornerstone of the nation’s  energy security and a driving force behind its economic  growth and industrial development. With its abundant  availability, cost-effectiveness, and reliability, coal  remains a strategic asset in sustaining India’s power  generation and supporting the nation’s transition toward  energy self-reliance.   As  on 31st March 2025, India’s coal-based power  generation capacity stands at ~ 215 GW out of a total  installed capacity of ~ 475 GW, highlighting coal’s  indispensable role in maintaining a stable, affordable,  and uninterrupted electricity supply nationwide.   India  has emerged as the second-largest producer of coal  globally, with a production of 1,047 Million Tonnes (Mt)  during the fiscal year 2024–25. The sector remains largely  dominated by public sector enterprises, primarily Coal  India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company  Limited (SCCL), which continue to be the bedrock of  domestic coal production.    C  oal India Limited, with its seven wholly owned coal- producing subsidiaries and one mine planning and  consultancy arm, maintained its position as the largest  coal-producing company in the world, registering a  production of 781 Mt during FY 2024–25. This accounts  for nearly 74% of India’s total coal output, reinforcing  CIL’s strategic importance. CIL continues to meet  about 40% of the country’s primary commercial energy  requirement, underscoring its strategic importance in  India’s energy landscape.   L ooking ahead, coal is poised to remain a dominant  fuel in India’s energy portfolio. As envisioned in the  Vision @2047 roadmap, coal will continue to be a pivotal  component in securing the country’s energy future.  While the growth in coal demand may moderate post- 2035, absolute demand is expected to remain steady or  increase, driven by sustained base load requirements.   In alignment with  this long-term vision, CIL has charted  a roadmap to achieve a production milestone of 1  Billion Tonnes (BT) by FY 2028–29, with production  levels projected to peak at 1,200 Mt by FY 2034–35.

Interest coverage ratio = (PBT+ Finance cost) to finance cost     Driven by whooping tar get of production, offtake  and operational efficiency during financial year 2024- 25, group has strived to proximate its previously  achieved outshining performance. However due  to decline in average sales rate and slight increase  in total expense during the fiscal year, decrease in  PBT is 4% compared to the previous year, while PAT  declined by 6% over the previous year. Overall CIL  group achieved a pre-tax profit (PBT) of   C  46,966  crore and a post-tax profit (PAT) of   C  35,302 crore.     T he Board of Directors of the holding company has  recommended a final dividend of   C   5.15 per equity  share, subject to approval in the ensuing AGM. This  final dividend is over and above interim dividends of   C   21.35 which were paid to its shareholders during  the current year. Thus, the total dividend for the FY  2024-25 is  H  26.50 per share which is 265% of Face  Value of  H  10 per equity share against the previous  year of  H  25.50 per share.     T he operating margin went down by 2% i.e. from  30% to 28% during the current year. This is mainly  due to increase in depreciation and contractual  expenses. Similarly, there has been decrease of 1%  i.e. from 29% to 28% in net profit margin. Decline in  return on net worth is mainly due to increase in net  worth by 20% from   C  82,711 crore to   C  99,105 crore  as compared to the PAT which declined by 6%.     Inter est coverage ratio decreased from 61 to 54 due  to increased borrowings by ECL and subsidiary of  SECL and CCL over previous year. Increase in other  equity by 21% and in non-current liabilities by 3%  with degrowth of 6% in PAT has resulted decrease in  return on capital employed by 3%.

Sales (Note 12.1):     Sales ar e presented as gross sales in notes to financial  statements and net of various statutory levies in the  statement of Profit & Loss comprising royalty, GST,  GST Compensation cess, cess on coal, payment to  national mineral exploration trust (NMET), district  mineral foundation (DMF) and other levies etc. The  Income from the sale of coal is mainly dependent  on the notified price and e-auction premium which  depends on the demand of coal.     During the ye ar, the group achieved an offtake of  762.98 million tonnes against 753.51 million tonnes  in the previous year, registering an increase of 1%.  FSA sales decreased by   C   2,085 crore as compared  to previous year due to volume decline in FSA  sales quantity and average price per tonne by 1%.  E auction quantity registered a volume growth of  13% however sharp decline of 17% in the e-auction  average price led to overall 6% decline in e-auction  net sales value. Thus, the decline in average sales  price from   C  1,728 per tonne of previous year to   C  1,667 per tonne during the year has adversely  impacted the net sales by   C   3,369 crore in comparison  to FY 2023-24 despite the volume growth of 1%.     Other operating revenue (Note 12.1):    A major element of other operating revenue  is transportation charges recovered from the  customers. The company charges transportation  Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 376 377 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

costs for the transportation of coal to dispatch points  under various slabs of distance and corresponding  rates. The loading and transportation charges  recovered (net of levies) during the year was   C   7,692  crore against   C   7,050 crore in the previous year with  an increase of 9% mainly due to increase in offtake  and increase in average surface transportation  charges rates. Evacuation facility charges are billed  on all dispatches to customers at the rate of   C   60 per  tonne. Increase in offtake contributed to the increase  in evacuation facility charges (net of levies) from   C    4,513 crore in the previous year to   C   4545 crore in  the current year.     R evenue from services mainly includes consultancy  and other services provided by CMPDIL, a  subsidiary of CIL to parties outside the group,  and freight income from rail operation by the  subsidiary companies of CCL, SECL and MCL. The  Revenue from services stood at   C  1,294 crore (net  of levies) in FY 2024-25 against   C   433 crore (net of  levies) in FY 2023-24.     S tripping activity provision is being reversed  systematically whenever the situation of reversal  arises as per material accounting policy of the  Group. Reversal of Stripping Activity Provision  during the year of   C  2,882 crore as compared to last  year of   C  2,438 crore has also led to increase in other  operating revenue.    Other Income (Note 12.2):     Other income includes inter est income from  deposits with banks, gain on the sale of mutual  funds, rental income, write-back of provisions and  liabilities, other miscellaneous income, etc. During  the year, other income increased by   C   1,501 crore  (19%) from   C   7,969 crore to   C   9,470 crore.      T here is increase in interest income by   C  780  crore mainly due to increase in interest income  on income tax refund as compared to previous  year. Miscellaneous income includes mainly bank  guarantee encashment, penalty and liquidated  damage from suppliers, processing fee income for  e-auction etc. There is decrease of miscellaneous  income by   C  493 crore. There is increase of   C   1,303  crore in provision write back as compared to previous  year mainly due to AMRCD decision on STC.

Other consumables  used in coal mining operations include tyres, spares  for other plants and machinery relating to coal  handling plants and beneficiation facilities, and  other miscellaneous stores and spares. The cost of  material consumed has reduced by   C   333 crore (3%)  from   C  11,580 crore in FY 2023-24 to   C  11,247 crore  in FY 2024-25. Decline in departmental composite  production, explosive prices and average bulk  diesel rates has resulted in cost saving benefits to  the group to the tune of   C  530 crore. However due  to acquisition of warranty spares for new HEMM, the  cost has increased by   C  197 crore.    Employee benefit expenses (Note 13.3):    The most significant expense of the group,  employee benefit expense covering 43% of the total  expense, shows human resource strength of the  group. Employee Benefits expenses include salary,  wages and allowances, contributions to provident  fund, pension, post retirement medical and gratuity,  staff welfare expenses, overtime payments, leave  encashment, attendance bonus, productivity and  performance linked bonus and other incentives, and  other employee benefits.     T he employee benefit expenses incurred during  the current year has declined by 5% as compared  to the previous year. There is a net reduction in  manpower by 8,589 employees during the current  year i.e. 4% reduction in total strength of last year.  Recognition of past service cost in actuarial valuation  due to implementation of NCWA-XI for the Non- Executives employees during FY 2023-24 also led to  comparative reduction in salary cost during the year.       C  ontractual expense (Note 13.7):    Contractual expenses which primarily consist of  transportation charges for coal, sand, and materials  carried out through third-party contractors,  contractor expenses relating to wagon loading  operations, outsourcing contracts related to  Overburden removal (OBR) and Coal extraction  activities and other miscellaneous works carried  out through third-party contractors for haul road  maintenance at mines and temporary lighting etc.     Incr ease in the contractual expense of   C  3,423 crore is  mainly reflection of group’s tremendous operational  performance of incremental 7 Mill. Te. of coal and 54  McUM of overburden with 5% growth in contractual  composite production over last year. Increase  in transportation & Wagon Loading charges of     C  164 crore and in other contractual work of   C  785  crore has been reported.    Stripping activity adjustment (Note 13.6):    This expense adjustment pertains to open cast  mines. Stripping activity adjustment comprises  mainly recognition of improved access to coal.  Improved access to coal arises when the actual  volume of overburden removed is greater than  the expected volume of overburden removal. The  stripping cost for excess overburden removal over  the expected overburden removal is capitalised  to the stripping activity asset. During the year  capitalisation of improved access to coal of   C  4,106  crore in comparison to   C  3,700 crore in last year is  again portrayal of group’s excellent performance of  overburden removal over expectation.    Other Expenses (Note 13.8):    The 6% decrease in other expenses is the result  of offsetting movements within its individual  components, where certain expense elements  experienced notable increases, while others  declined. The overall reduction indicates improved  cost control and operational efficiency in specific  areas, despite upward pressure in a few categories.  The following analysis outlines the key drivers  behind these variances.     In adher ence to guidelines issued by the Department  of Public Enterprises and the provisions of The  Companies Act, 2013, Group has developed its  CSR Policy. In accordance with the policy, the Group  undertakes CSR activities out of the themes listed  in Schedule-VII of the Companies Act. The group  incurred  C  850.17 crore during the current year which  is 30% higher when compared to CSR expenses of   C  654 crore incurred during the previous year. Group  bagged various accolades in the field of CSR initiatives.      T here has been increase in repair and maintenance  expenses on plant and equipment by   C   105 crore  and on building   C  57 crore. Recognition of expected  credit loss of   C  815 crore in last year on trade  receivables led to comparative decrease in provision  during the year. Expenditure on Environment and  tree plantation is witness of group’s perseverance  towards environmental consciousness and  awareness. However, fall reported in the expenditure  on environment and tree plantation by 40% over  last year, is mainly due to increase in recognition of  receivable for environmental activities falling under  mine closure activities.     Incr ease in Research and Development Expenses  by   C  212 crore, travelling expenses by   C  71 crore,  Demurrage charges by   C  53 crore, Security expenses  by   C   115 crore, Consultancy charges by   C  143 crore  has been reported.     During FY  2023-24, Government of Jharkhand  brought a scheme "The Jharkhand Karadhan  Adhiniyamo ki Bakaya Rashi ka Samadhan Adhiniyam  2022" (in short "Kar Samadhan Yojna 2022") for  settlement of old arrears and disputes of JVAT Act  2005, CST Act 1956, Electricity Duty Act 1948 etc.  Accordingly, old pending cases of CCL and BCCL  were settled under the scheme. Similarly, in last year  NCL recognised provision for terminal taxes for the  first time. These odd expenses led to comparative  decrease in the rates and taxes expenses by   C  869  crore during the year.     Similarly , in miscellaneous expenses, in FY 2023-24  SECL recognised   C  514 crore payable to Ministry  of Coal in respect of profit accrued on Gare Palma  mines for which Coal India Ltd. was appointed  as custodian akin to a designated custodian. This  peculiar item also led to comparative decline in the  miscellaneous expenses by 27% during the year.

Net increase in deposit under the mine  closure plan escrow account of   C  820 crore is mainly by deposit in fund   C  404 crore, interest credit is   C  854 crore and  reimbursement from fund is   C  438 crore during the year. Increase in shifting and rehabilitation fund by   C  794 crore is  attributable to contribution received from coal producing subsidiary companies and interest accrued thereon. There  has been decrease in accrued interest on bank deposits by   C  182 crore due to decrease in bank deposit which are  expected to realise in cash between 3 months to 12 months period after the reporting date.      Other current and non-current assets (Note 6.1 to Note 6.2):    Continuous capex and future plan of the group has steered the increase in capital advance by   C   604 crore. Parallel to  mine expansion and production, incessant mine closure activities are also being undertaken by the group in line with  its committed plans. Increase in progressive mine closure cost receivables from escrow fund of   C  560 crore during the  year is thriving depiction of group’s mine closure commitment. Deposits and receivables have decreased by   C  209 crore  during the year mainly due to refund of income tax. Increase in GST input tax credit of   C  2723 crore is majorly attributed  to inverted duty structure in the Coal Industry.    Equity Share Capital (Note 7.1):       T here is only one class of equity share having a face  value of   C   10/- each fully paid. The holders of the  equity shares are entitled to receive dividends as  declared from time to time and are entitled to voting  rights proportionate to their share holding at the  meeting of shareholders. There has not been any  change in the equity share capital of the company.  The shares of Coal India Limited is listed in two  major stock exchanges of India, viz. Bombay Stock  Exchange and National Stock Exchange on and from  4th November,2010. During FY 2023-24, through  Offer for sale method of disinvestment, there was  change in the Government of India shareholding  from 66.13% to 63.13%. Shareholding of Life  Insurance of India is 11.21% as compared to 10.18%  shareholding of last year.    Other Equity (Note 7.2):      T he movement in retained earnings was on account  of profit earned during the year and payment of  dividends. During the year, Coal India has paid   C  3,081 crore final dividend for the FY 2023-24 and  Interim dividend of   C  13,157 crore for the FY 2024-25.    Borrowings (Note 8.1):     T he borrowings appearing in the books of the  group are mainly on account of borrowings   C   6,212  crore made by Chhattisgarh East Railway Limited  (CERL) and Chhattisgarh East-West Railway Limited  (CEWRL), which are subsidiary companies of SECL  and   C     C  1,029 crore by Jharkhand Central Railway  Limited (JCRL), a subsidiary of CCL. Long term loan  from Export Development Corporation, Canada   C  154 crore and short-term loan from Bank   C  1,509  crore against fixed deposits is related to Eastern  Coalfields Limited (ECL).    Trade Payables (Note 8.3):     With gr owing procurement and transactions with  MSME parties, trade payable balance from them  has shown rise of 5%. This is also a mark of group’s  continuous endeavor to promote the micro, small  & medium enterprises (MSME). The ambitious  performance goals set forth by the Group have  necessitated an intensified scale of operations,  which in turn has contributed to a notable increase  of 22% in the outstanding dues of creditors other  than MSME also.      Other Financial liabilities (Note 8.4):      C  ommensurate with operational growth, additional  procurement of goods and services has resulted  into increase in the security deposits from the  vendors by   C  193 crore. High balance payable for  capital expenditure of   C  6,838 crore is indication  of group’s growing capital expenditure on the  infrastructure. Employee benefit payable is basically  payable amount for the latest month of the year. As a  result of annual increment effect, employee benefits  payable increased by   C  61 crore. Surge in Others  comprises mainly liability for Composition user fee  of BCCL and CCL.    Other current and non-current liabilities (Note  10.1 to Note 10.2):    The reduction during the year in the government  grants amount received for various public  infrastructure capital projects works at Bharat  Coking Coal Limited, Central Coalfields Limited and  Mahanadi Coalfields Limited is for amortisation of  balance in correspondence with respective assets.  Shifting and Rehabilitation work are undertaken for  fire and stabilization of unstable areas of Eastern  Coal Fields Limited and Bharat Coking Coal Limited  under direction of the Ministry of Coal. The increase  in the liability is attributable to the interest credit  and contributions dues from subsidiary companies.  Statutory dues are payable amount for the latest  month of the year. The balance of   C  8,499 crore  reflects our gigantic turnover.    Provisions (Note 9.1):    The main factor of reduction in provision has been  implementation of NCWA-XI during the year 2023- 24. This caused the decline in the employee benefit  provision by   C  709 crore. The second main reason  for reduction of provision has been the systematic  reversal of stripping activity provision by   C  2,882  crore in the mines where volume of overburden  removed during the year has been more than  expected volume of overburden removal. The  variation in employee benefit provisions for  gratuity, leave, and PRMB are primarily due to an  increase in obligations resulting from a reduction  in the discount rate from 7% to 6.60%. This increase  was partially offset by liability payouts linked to a  decrease in overall manpower compared to the  previous year and changes in the funding status of  the related plan assets. As a result, there is overall  marginal decrease of only   C   111 crore for these  employee benefits in the provision head. As per  MCP guidelines dated 31.01.2025, the revised rate  of provision is   C  14 lakh and   C  2 lakh per hectare as  compared to   C  9 lakh and  C  1.50 lakh as per previous  applicable guidelines in case of opencast and  underground mines respectively. As a result, there  has been increase in the mine closure provision of   C  2,912 crore net of withdrawal during the period.

Coal  India Limited (CIL) has consistently demonstrated that  with strategic planning and sustainable practices, mining  operations can not only minimize environmental impact  but also contribute positively to ecological restoration.   Envir onmental protection measures are implemented  concurrently with mining activities to maintain acceptable  levels of key physical attributes such as air and water  quality, hydrogeology, noise levels, and land resources.   T o mitigate fugitive dust emissions, water spraying  systems have been installed across various operational  points including roads, washeries, First Mile Connectivity  (FMC) projects, coal handling plants (CHPs), feeder  breakers, crushers, coal transfer points, and stockyards.   Sustainable Development Initiatives:   CIL has undertaken a range of sustainable development  activities such as:   •   Alterna tive use of overburden (OB)   •   Cr eation of Amrit Sarovars   •   Mine tourism initia tives   •   P isci-culture in mine voids   •   Installa tion of solar energy plants   •   Ener gy efficiency improvements   Eco P arks and Mine Tourism:   T o promote biodiversity and recreational opportunities,  CIL has developed 33 eco-parks and mine tourism  sites, including: 	  Kalidaspur Bio-Diversity Park (ECL) 	  Parasnath Udyan, AKWMC Colliery (BCCL) 	  Bishrampur Tourism Site (SECL) 	  Chander Shekhar Azad Eco Park, Bina (NCL) 	  Neem Vatika, Raiyatwari, Chandrapur (WCL) 	  Kayakalp Vatika (CCL) 	  Ananta Medicinal Garden (MCL)   W ater Management   Ef fluent treatment facilities have been established across  major projects to handle mine, workshop, and CHP  effluents using oil and grease traps, sedimentation ponds,  and water storage and reuse systems. Domestic sewage  treatment plants are also operational for processing  household waste.   Gr oundwater recharge is facilitated through rainwater  harvesting, construction of ponds/lagoons, and de- silting of existing water bodies, both within mines and  surrounding villages.   In FY  2024–25, CIL shared 2513.66 lakh cubic meters  of water with nearby communities, benefiting over  11.79 lakh people in 880 villages for domestic and  agricultural purposes.

Trees are  incredible for improving air quality and reducing noise. 	  In the last five years alone, we've planted over 13.1  million saplings within our mining areas, covering  more than 5,400 hectares. 	  We've also planted over 3.5 million saplings in areas  outside our direct mining operations, covering  nearly 2,400 hectares. 	  The plantation within mine leasehold area, in last 5  years, has created an annual carbon sink potential of  2,72,000 tonnes of CO 2  equivalent. 	  Just last financial year (2024-25), we planted over  4 million saplings and even carried out grassing  over 206 hectares to help stabilize the soil and  promote greenery.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that  could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its  settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not  affect its classification.   All other liabilities ar e classified as non-current.   Having r egard to the nature of the business being carried  out by the company, the company has ascertained  its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose  of current and non-current classification of assets  and liabilities. 2.3   R evenue recognition   R evenue from contracts with customers   R evenue is principally derived from the sale of coal, related  ancillary services, and products. Revenue from sales of  products is recognized when control of the products has  transferred, being when the products are delivered to  the customer. Delivery occurs when the products have  been shipped or delivered to the specific location as the  case may be, and the risks of loss have been transferred  in accordance with the sales contract. The amount of  revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which  the Company is or expects to be entitled in exchange for  those goods or services. Accumulated experience is used  to estimate and provide for the variable consideration as  per the sales contract, and revenue is only recognized  to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant  reversal will not occur. The amount of consideration does  not contain a significant financing component as payment  terms are less than one year as per the sales contracts.   T he company has a number of long-term contracts to  supply products to customers in future periods. Generally,  revenue is recognized on an invoice basis, as each unit  sold is a separate performance obligation, and therefore  the right to consideration from a customer corresponds  directly with performance completed to date.   Interest   Inter est income from a financial asset is recognized when  it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the  company and the amount of income can be measured  reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by  reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective  interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly  discounts the estimated future cash receipts through  the expected life of the financial asset to that asset's net  carrying amount on initial recognition.   Dividends   Dividend is r ecognised when the company’s right to  receive the payment is established, which is generally  when shareholders approve the dividend.   Other Claims   R evenue in respect of Other claims (including interest  on delayed realization from customers) are recognized  only when there is reasonable certainty as to the ultimate  collection and the amount can be measured reliably. 2.4   Gr ants from Government   Government Gr ants are not recognised until there is  reasonable assurance that the Company will comply  with the conditions attached to them and that there is  reasonable certainty that grants will be received.   Government  grants are recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which  the Company recognises the related expenses or costs  for which the grants are intended to compensate.   Government Gr ants related to assets are presented in the  balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income  and are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on  systematic basis over the useful life of asset.   Gr ants related to income (i.e. grant related to other than  assets) are presented as part of statement of profit and  loss under the head ‘Other Income’.   A  government grant/assistance that becomes receivable  as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred  or for the purpose of giving immediate financial  support to the Company with no future related costs,  is recognised in profit or loss of the period in which it  becomes receivable.   T he Government grants or grants in the nature of  promoter’s contribution is recognised directly in “Capital  Reserve” which forms part of the “Shareholders fund”. 2.5 Leases   A  contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys  the right to control the use of an identified asset for a  period of time in exchange for consideration.   2.5.1 C ompany as a lessee     T he Company assesses whether a contract contains  a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or  contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to  control the use of an identified asset for a period  of time in exchange for consideration. To assess  whether a contract conveys the right to control the  use of an identified asset, the Company assesses  whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an  identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially  all of the economic benefits from use of the asset  through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company  has the right to direct the use of the asset.

The wholly owned subsidiary incorporated for  manufacturing solar value chain known as ’CIL Solar PV  Limited’ which was yet to commence business has been  approved for closure by the competent authority. CIL  also has a fully owned mining company in Mozambique  known as ‘Coal India Africana Limitada’ which was yet to  commence operations, has also been approved for closure  by the competent authority. The Company is also engaged  in certain ventures through Joint Venture arrangements  and there are also seven step-down subsidiaries.   T he Standalone financial statements for the year ended  March 31, 2025, were approved for issue by the Board of  Directors of the company on May 07, 2025. B.   S tatement of Compliance and Recent Accounting  Pronouncement   i)   S tatement of Compliance    These Standalone financial statements have been  prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting  Standards (hereinafter referred to as the “Ind AS”) as  notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) read with Section  133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”). The Ind  ASs issued, notified and made effective till the financial  statements are authorised and have been considered for  the purpose of preparation of these financial statements.     T he accounting policies are applied consistently  except where a newly issued accounting standard  is initially adopted or a revision to an existing  accounting standard requires a change in the  accounting policy hitherto in use.   ii)   Applica tion of new and revised standards:     Ministry of  Corporate Affairs (MCA) notifies new  standards or amendments to the existing standards  under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, from time to time. MCA has notified on 7th  May, 2025 amendments to the Ind AS 21 ‘The Effects  of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. Revision in  the standard does not have any material impact on  the profit and loss and earning per share for the year. Note 2: Material Accounting Policy Information 2.1   Basis of  preparation of financial statements   T he standalone financial statements have been prepared  under the historical cost convention on accrual basis  except certain financial instruments that are measured in  terms of relevant Ind AS at amortized costs or fair value at  the end of each reporting period.   Historical cost convention is gener ally based on the  fair value of the consideration given in exchange for  goods and services.   T he functional currency of the company is determined  as the currency of the primary economic environment in  which it operates. The standalone financial statements are  presented in Indian Rupees  ( H ) and all values are rounded  off to the ‘rupees in crore’ up to two decimal points. 2.2   Curr ent and Non-Current Classification   T he Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance  Sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An  asset is treated as current by the company when:   (a)   it e xpects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or  consume it, in its normal operating cycle;   (b)   it holds the asset primarily for the purpose  of trading;   (c)   it e xpects to realise the asset within twelve months  after the reporting period; or   (d)   the asset is cash or a cash equivalent (as defined in  Ind  AS 7) unless the asset is restricted from being  exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least  twelve months after the reporting period.   All other assets ar e classified as non-current.   A  liability is treated as current by the company when:   (a)   it e xpects to settle the liability in its normal  operating cycle;   (b)   it holds the liability primarily for the  purpose of  trading;   (c)   the liability is due to be set tled within twelve months  after the reporting period; or   (d)   it does not have an unconditional right to defer  set tlement of the liability for at least twelve months  Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 402 403 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the  land like, rehabilitation expenses, resettlement cost  and compensation in lieu of employment incurred for  concerned displaced persons etc   Af ter recognition, an item of all other Property, plant and  equipment are carried at its cost less any accumulated  depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses  under Cost Model. The cost of an item of property, plant  and equipment comprises:   (a)   its pur chase price, including import duties and non- refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade  discounts and rebates.   (b)   any costs dir ectly attributable to bringing the  asset to the location and condition necessary  for it to be capable of operating in the manner  intended by management.   (c)   the initial estima te of the costs of dismantling and  removing the item and restoring the site on which  it is located, the obligation for which the Company  incurs either when the item is acquired or as a  consequence of having used the item during a  particular period for purposes other than to produce  inventories during that period.   (d)   Inter est on Borrowings utilized to finance the  construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as  part of cost of the asset until such time that the asset  is ready for its intended use.   Each par t of an item of property, plant and equipment  with a cost that is significant in relation to the total  cost of the item is depreciated separately. However,  significant part(s) of an item of PPE having same useful  life and depreciation method are grouped together in  determining the depreciation charge.    C  osts of the day to-day servicing described as ‘repairs and  maintenance’ are recognised in the statement of profit  and loss in the period in which the same are incurred.   Subsequent cost of  replacing parts which are significant  in relation to the total cost of an item of property, plant  and equipment are recognised in the carrying amount of  the item, if it is probable that future economic benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Company;  and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The  carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is  derecognised in accordance with the derecognition  policy mentioned below.   When major inspection is performed,  its cost is recognised  in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and  equipment as a replacement if it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with the item will flow to  the Company; and the cost of the item can be measured  reliably. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of  the previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts)  is derecognised.   An item of  Property, plant or equipment is derecognised  upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are  expected from the continuing use of assets. Any gain or  loss arising on such derecognition of an item of property  plant and equipment is recognised in the statement of  profit and Loss.   Depr eciation on property, plant and equipment,  except freehold land, is provided as per cost model on  straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the  asset as follows: Assets Useful Life Other Land (incl.  Leasehold Land) :   Life of  the project or  lease term whichever is  lower  Building (incl. Roads) :   3-60 ye ars Telecommunication :   3-9 ye ars Railway Sidings :   15 ye ars Plant and Equipment (incl.  Railway Corridor, others) :   1-30 ye ars Computers and Laptops :   3 Y ears  Office equipment :   3-5 ye ars Furniture and Fixtures :   10 ye ars Vehicles :   8-10 ye ars   Based on technical evalua tion, the management believes  that the useful lives given above best represent the period  over which the management expects to use the asset.  Hence the useful lives of the assets may be different from  the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II  of the Companies Act, 2013.   T he estimated useful life of the assets are reviewed at the  end of each financial year.   T he residual value of Property, plant and equipment is  considered as 5% of the original cost of the asset except  for some items of assets such as other land, site restoration  asset, other mining infrastructure, surveyed off assets.  Useful life has been technically estimated to be one year  with nil residual value for items such as Coal tub, winding  ropes, haulage ropes, stowing pipes and safety lamps etc.    Depr eciation on the assets added/disposed of during the  year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the  month of addition / disposal.    V alue of “Other Land” includes land acquired under Coal  Bearing Area (Acquisition & Development) (CBA) Act, 1957,  Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Right to Fair Compensation  and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and  Resettlement (RFCTLAAR) Act, 2013, Long term transfer of  government land etc., which are amortised on the basis of  the balance life of the project; and in case of Leasehold  land such amortisation is based on lease period or balance  life of the project whichever is lower.     At the commencement da te, a lessee shall recognise  a right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at  the present value of the lease payments that are  not paid at that date for all leases unless the lease  term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset  is of low value.     Subsequently , right-of-use asset is measured using  cost model whereas, the lease liability is measured  by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest  on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to  reflect the lease payments made and re-measuring  the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or  lease modifications     T he lease liability is initially measured at amortized  cost at the present value of the future lease  payments. The lease payments are discounted  using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if  not readily determinable, using the incremental  borrowing rates of these leases. Lease liabilities  are premeasured with a corresponding adjustment  to the related right of use asset if the Company  changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an  extension or a termination option. Lease liability and  ROU asset are separately presented in the Balance  Sheet and lease payments are classified as financing  cash flows. Lease liability obligations is presented  separately under the head "Financial Liabilities".     F inance charges are recognised in finance costs in  the Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the costs are  included in the carrying amount of another asset  applying other applicable standards.     Right-of-use asset is depr eciated over the useful life  of the asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the  asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term or  if the cost of the right-to-use asset reflects that the  lessee will exercise a purchase option. Otherwise,  the lessee shall depreciate the right-to-use asset  from the commencement date to the earlier of the  end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the  end of the lease term.   2.5.2 C ompany as a lessor     Assets ar e given on lease either as finance lease or  operating lease.    Finance Lease:  A lease is classified as finance lease  if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards  incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.  Initially, asset held under finance lease is recognised  in Balance Sheet and presented as a receivable at  an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.  Finance income is recognised over the lease term,  based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate  of return on Company's net investment in the lease.    Operating Lease:  A lease which is not classified as  a finance lease is an operating lease. The Company  recognises lease payments in case of assets given on  operating leases as income on a straight line basis. 2.6   Non-curr ent assets held for sale   T he Company classifies non-current assets and (or  disposal groups) as held for sale if their carrying amounts  will be recovered principally through a sale rather than  through continuing use. Actions required to complete  the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant  changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to  sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed  to the sale expected to be completed within one year  from the date of classification.   F or these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges  of non-current assets for other non-current assets when  the exchange has commercial substance. The criteria for  held for sale classification is regarded met only when the  assets or disposal group is available for immediate sale  in its present condition, subject only to terms that are  usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal  groups), its sale is highly probable; and it will genuinely  be sold, not abandoned. The Company treats sale of the  asset or disposal group to be highly probable when: 	  The appropriate level of management is committed  to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), 	  An active programme to locate a buyer and  complete the plan has been initiated 	  The asset (or disposal group) is being actively  marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in  relation to its current fair value, 	  The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as  a completed sale within one year from the date of  classification, and 	  Actions required to complete the plan indicate that  it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will  be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.   Non-curr ent asset or disposal groups classified as held  for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and  fair value less costs to sell. 2.7   P roperty, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and  Depreciation/Amortisation   An item of  PPE is recognized as an asset if it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.   PPE  are initially measured at cost of acquisition/ construction including decommissioning or restoration  cost wherever required. Cost of land includes expenditures  Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 404 405 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Whichever event occurs first;   On being br ought to revenue, the assets under capital  work in progress are reclassified as a component of  property, plant, and equipment under the nomenclature  “Other Mining Infrastructure”. Other Mining infrastructures  are amortised from the year when the mine is brought  under revenue in 20 years or the working life of the  project whichever is less. 2.11 Intangible Assets and Amortisation   Intangible assets acquir ed separately are measured  on initial recognition at cost. Cost includes any directly  attributable expenses necessary to make the assets  ready for its intended use. After initial recognition,  intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.    Subsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the  carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future  economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to  the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.   An item of Intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected from its use  or disposal. Gains or losses arising from the derecognition of  an intangible asset are measured as the difference between  the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the  asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  when the asset is derecognised.   Internally gener ated intangibles, excluding capitalised  development costs, are not capitalised. Instead, the  related expenditure is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss and other comprehensive income in the  period in which the expenditure is incurred.   The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either  finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are  amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed  for impairment whenever there is an indication that the  intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period  and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with  a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each  reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or  the expected pattern of consumption of future economic  benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify  the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and  are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The  amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is  recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Amortisation  of intangible asset is provided on straight line basis over  the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset as follows: Intangible Assets Useful Life SAP/ERP :   6 ye ars Other Computer Software :   License period R ail Corridor :   Life as per MoU  contr act period   An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not   amortised but is tested for impairment at each reporting date.   Explor ation and Evaluation assets attributable to blocks  identified for sale or proposed to be sold to outside  agencies (i.e. for blocks not earmarked for CIL) are however,  classified as Intangible Assets and tested for impairment.   Expenditur e on research is charged to expenditure as and  when incurred. Expenditure on development is capitalized  only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the  product or process is technically and commercially  feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the  Company intends to & has sufficient resources to complete  development and to use or sell the asset. 2.12 Impairment of Assets (other than financial assets)   T he Company assesses at the end of each reporting  period whether there is any indication that an asset may  be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. An asset’s  recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s or cash- generating unit’s value in use and its fair value less costs of  disposal, and is determined for an individual asset, unless  the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely  independent of those from other assets or groups of assets,  in which case the recoverable amount is determined for  the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The  company considers individual mines as separate cash- generating units for the purpose of a test of impairment.   If  the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment  loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 2.13 Investment Property   P roperty (land or a building or part of a building or both)  held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather  than for, use in the production or supply of goods or services  or for administrative purposes; or sale in the ordinary course  of businesses are classified as an investment property.   Investment pr operty is measured initially at its cost,  including related transaction costs and where applicable  borrowing costs.   Investment pr operties are depreciated using the straight- line method over their estimated useful lives.   Assets tha t are fully depreciated and retired from active  use are disclosed separately as surveyed off assets at its  residual value under Property, Plant Equipment and are  tested for impairment.   T ransition to Ind AS   The Company elected to continue with the carrying value as  per the cost model (for all of its property, plant and equipment  as recognised in the financial statements as at the date of  transition to Ind ASs, measured as per the previous GAAP). 2.8   Mine Closur e, Site Restoration and  Decommissioning Obligation   The Company’s obligation for land reclamation and  decommissioning of structures consists of spending at  both surface and underground mines in accordance with  the guidelines from the Ministry of Coal, Government  of India. The Company estimates its obligation for Mine  Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning based  upon detailed calculation and technical assessment of the  amount and timing of the future cash spending to perform  the required work. Mine Closure expenditure is provided  as per approved Mine Closure Plan. The estimates of  expenses are escalated for inflation, and then discounted  at a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of  the time value of money and the risks, such that the amount  of provision reflects the present value of the expenditures  expected to be incurred to settle the obligation. The  Company records a corresponding asset associated with  the liability for final reclamation and mine closure. The  obligation and corresponding assets are recognised  in the period in which the liability is incurred. The asset  representing the total site restoration cost (as estimated by  Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited) as per  the mine closure plan is recognised as a separate item in  PPE and amortised over the balance project/mine life.    T he value of the provision is progressively increased over  time as the effect of discounting unwinds; creating an  expense recognised as a financial expense.   F urther, a specific escrow fund account is maintained for  this purpose as per the approved mine closure plan.   T he progressive mine closure expenses incurred on  year to year basis forming part of the total mine closure  obligation are initially recognised as receivable from  the escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the  obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn  after the concurrence of the certifying agency. 2.9   Explor ation and Evaluation Assets   Explor ation and evaluation assets comprise costs that are  attributable to the search for coal and related resources,  pending the determination of technical feasibility and  the assessment of commercial viability of an identified  resource which comprises inter alia the following: 	  acquisition of rights to explore 	  researching and analysing historical exploration data; 	  gathering exploration data through topographical,  geo-chemical and geo-physical studies; 	  exploratory drilling, trenching, and sampling; 	  determining and examining the volume and grade  of the resource; 	  surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; 	  Conducting market and finance studies.   T he above includes employee remuneration, cost of  materials and fuel used, payments to contractors etc.   As the intangible component r epresents an insignificant/ indistinguishable portion of the overall expected tangible  costs to be incurred and recouped from future exploitation,  these costs along with other capitalised exploration costs  are recorded as exploration and evaluation assets.    Explor ation and evaluation costs are capitalised on a  project-by-project basis pending the determination  of technical feasibility and commercial viability of the  project and disclosed as a separate line item under non- current assets. They are subsequently measured at cost  less accumulated impairment/provision.    Once pr oved reserves are determined and the  development of mines/projects are sanctioned,  exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to  “Development” under capital work in progress. However,  if proved reserves are not determined, the exploration  and evaluation asset is derecognised. 2.10 Development Expenditure   When pr oved reserves are determined and the  development of mines/projects are sanctioned,  capitalised exploration and evaluation cost is  recognised as assets under construction and disclosed  as a component of capital work in progress under the  head “Development”. All subsequent development  expenditure is also capitalised. The development  expenditure capitalised is net of proceeds from the sale  of coal extracted during the development phase.    C  ommercial Operation   T he project/mines are brought to revenue; when  commercial readiness of a project/mine to yield  production on a sustainable basis is established either on  the basis of conditions specifically stated in the project  report or on the basis of the following criteria:   (a)   F rom the beginning of the financial year immediately  after the year in which the project achieves physical  output of 25% of rated capacity as per the approved  project report, or Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 406 407 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) ventures are accounted as per equity method  as prescribed in para 10 of Ind AS 28.     2.14.1.2.5 Other Equity Investment       All other equity investments in scope of  Ind  AS 109 are measured at fair value through  profit or loss.     The Company may make an irrevocable election  to present in other comprehensive income  subsequent changes in the fair value. The  Company makes such election on an instrument  by-instrument basis. The classification is made  on initial recognition and is irrevocable.       All fair value changes of  an equity instrument  classified at FVTOCI, are recognized in OCI.  There is no subsequent reclassification of fair  value gains and losses to the Statement of  Profit and Loss. However, the Company may  transfer the cumulative gain or loss within  equity. Dividends from such investments are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  as “other income” when the Company’s right to  receive payments is established.       Equity instruments included within the FVTPL   category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognized in the P&L.   2.14.1.3 Der ecognition     A  financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a  financial asset or part of a group of similar financial  assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from  the balance sheet) when: 	  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset  have expired, or 	  The Company has transferred its rights to  receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed  an obligation to pay the received cash flows in  full without material delay to a third party under  a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a)  the Company has transferred substantially all  the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the  Company has neither transferred nor retained  substantially all the risks and rewards of the  asset, but has transferred control of the asset.     When the Company has transferred its rights to  receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into  a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to  what extent it has retained the risks and rewards  of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor  retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of  the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the  Company continues to recognise the transferred  asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing  involvement. In that case, the Company also  recognises an associated liability. The transferred  asset and the associated liability are measured  on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations  that the Company has retained. Continuing  involvement that takes the form of a guarantee  over the transferred asset is measured at the lower  of the original carrying amount of the asset and   the maximum amount of consideration that the  Company could be required to repay.   2.14.1.4 Impairment of  financial assets (other than fair  value)     In accor dance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies  expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement  and recognition of impairment loss on the following  financial assets and credit risk exposure:     a)   F inancial assets that are debt instruments, and  are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans,  debt securities, deposits, trade receivables  and bank balance     b)   F inancial assets that are debt instruments and  are measured as at FVTOCI     c)   L ease receivables under Ind AS 116     d)   T rade receivables or any contractual right to  receive cash or another financial asset that  result from transactions that are within the  scope of Ind AS 115.     T he Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on: 	  Trade receivables or contract revenue  receivables; and 	  All lease receivables resulting from transactions  within the scope of Ind AS 116       T he application of simplified approach does  not require the Company to track changes in  credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment  loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each  reporting date, right from its initial recognition.   2.14.2 F inancial liabilities   2.14.2.1 Initial r ecognition and measurement     T he Company’s financial liabilities include trade and  other payables, loans and borrowings including  bank overdrafts.     All financial liabilities ar e recognised initially at fair  value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and  payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.   2.14.2.2 Subsequent me asurement     T he measurement of financial liabilities depends on  their classification, as described below: 2.14 Financial Instruments   A  financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to  a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or  equity instrument of another entity.   2.14.1 F inancial assets   2.14.1.1 Initial r ecognition and measurement     All financial assets ar e recognised initially at fair  value, in the case of financial assets not recorded  at fair value through profit or loss, plus transaction  costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the  financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets  that require delivery of assets within a time frame  established by regulation or convention in the  market place (regular way trades) are recognised  on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company  commits to purchase or sell the asset. However, trade  receivables that do not contain a significant financing  component are measured at transaction price.   2.14.1.2 Subsequent me asurement     F or purposes of subsequent measurement, financial  assets are classified in four categories: 	  Debt instruments at amortised cost 	  Debt instruments at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 	  Debt instruments, derivatives and equity  instruments at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL) 	  Equity instruments measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)     2.14.1.2.1 Debt instruments a t amortised cost       A  ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met:       a)   T he asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for  collecting contractual cash flows, and       b)    C  ontractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.       Af ter initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised  cost using the effective interest rate (EIR)  method. Amortised cost is calculated by  taking into account any discount or premium  on acquisition and fees or costs that are an  integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation  is included in finance income in the profit or  loss. The losses arising from impairment are  recognised in the profit or loss.     2.14.1.2.2 Debt instrument a t FVTOCI       A  ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the  FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:       a)   T he objective of the business model  is achieved both by collecting  contractual cash flows and selling the  financial assets, and       b)   T he asset’s contractual cash flows  represent SPPI.         Debt instruments included within the   FVTOCI category are measured initially as  well as at each reporting date at fair value.  Fair value movements are recognized in  the other comprehensive income (OCI).  However, the Company recognizes interest  income, impairment losses & reversals and  foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L.  On derecognition of the asset, cumulative  gain or loss previously recognised in OCI  is reclassified from the equity to P&L.  Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI  debt instrument is reported as interest  income using the EIR method.     2.14.1.2.3 Debt instrument a t FVTPL       FVTPL  is a residual category for debt  instruments. Any debt instrument, which  does not meet the criteria for categorization  as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is  classified as at FVTPL.       In  addition, the Company may elect to  designate a debt instrument, which otherwise  meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at  FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if  doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement  or recognition inconsistency (referred to as  ‘accounting mismatch’). The Company has not  designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.       Debt instruments included within the FVTPL   category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognized in the P&L.     2.14.1.2.4 Equity investments in subsidiaries,   associates and Joint Ventures       In  accordance of Ind AS 101 (First time  adoption of Ind AS), the carrying amount of  these investments as per previous GAAP as  on the date of transition is considered to be  the deemed cost.  Subsequently Investment in  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are  measured at cost.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)   2.14.2.5 Of fsetting of financial instruments     F inancial assets and financial liabilities are offset  and the net amount is reported in the standalone  balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable  legal right to offset the recognised amounts and  there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise  the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.   2.14.2.6 F air value measurement of financial instruments     F air value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date under current market conditions.     T he Company categorizes assets and liabilities  measured at fair value into one of three levels  depending on the ability to observe inputs  employed for such measurement:     (a)   L evel 1: inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in  active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     (b)   L evel 2: inputs other than quoted prices  included within level 1 that are observable either  directly or indirectly for the asset or liability.     (c)   L evel 3: inputs for the asset or liability which  are not based on observable market data  (unobservable inputs).     T he Company has an established control framework  with respect to the measurement of fair values.  This includes a finance team that has overall  responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value  measurements who regularly review significant  unobservable inputs, valuation adjustments and  fair value hierarchy under which the valuation  should be classified.   2.14.3 C ash and Cash equivalents    Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet  comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term  deposits with an original maturity of three months or  less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  in value. For the purpose of the standalone statement  of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of  cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of  outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an  integral part of the Company’s cash management. 2.15. Borrowing Costs   Borr owing costs are expensed as and when incurred  except where they are directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets  i.e. the assets that necessarily takes substantial period of  time to get ready for its intended use, in which case they  are capitalised as part of the cost of related asset up to the  date when the qualifying asset is ready for its intended use. 2.16 Taxation   Income tax e xpense represents the sum of the tax payable  for the year and deferred tax.   Curr ent tax is the amount of income taxes payable  (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for  a period. Taxable profit differs from “profit before income  tax” as reported in the statement of profit and loss and  other comprehensive income because it excludes items  of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in  other years and it further excludes items that are never  taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current  tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.   Deferr ed tax liabilities are generally recognised for  all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets  are generally recognised for all deductible temporary  difference to the extent that it is probable that taxable  profits will be available against which those deductible  temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and  liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference  arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other  than in a business combination) of other assets and  liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable  profit nor the accounting profit.   Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and  associates, except where the Company is able to control the  reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that  the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable  future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary  differences associated with such investments and interests  are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there  will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the  benefits of the temporary differences.   T he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed  at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable  profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset  to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are  reassessed at the end of each reporting year and are  recognised to the extent that it has become probable that  sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part  of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.   Deferr ed tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax  rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the  liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rate  (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the end of the reporting period.   T he measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets  reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the  manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the  reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount  of its assets and liabilities. ( H  in Crores) Original  classification  Revised  classification  Accounting treatment Amortised cost  FVTPL  Fair value is measured at reclassification date. Difference between previous amortized  cost and fair value is recognised in P&L.  FVTPL  Amortised  Cost  Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new gross carrying amount. EIR is  calculated based on the new gross carrying amount.  Amortised cost  FVTOCI  Fair value is measured at reclassification date. Difference between previous  amortised cost and fair value is recognised in OCI. No change in EIR due to  reclassification.  FVTOCI  Amortised cost  Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new amortised cost carrying amount.  However, cumulative gain or loss in OCI is adjusted against fair value. Consequently,  the asset is measured as if it had always been measured at amortised cost.  FVTPL  FVTOCI  Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new carrying amount. No other  adjustment is required.  FVTOCI  FVTPL  Assets continue to be measured at fair value. Cumulative gain or loss previously  recognized in OCI is reclassified to P&L at the reclassification date.     2.14.2.2.1  Financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss       F inancial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss include financial liabilities held for  trading and financial liabilities designated  upon initial recognition as at fair value through  profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified  as held for trading if they are incurred for the  purpose of repurchasing in the near term.  This category also includes derivative financial  instruments entered into by the Company that  are not designated as hedging instruments in  hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.  Separated embedded derivatives are also  classified as held for trading unless they are  designated as effective hedging instruments.       Gains  or losses on liabilities held for trading  are recognised in the profit or loss.     2.14.2.2.2 F inancial liabilities at amortised cost       Af ter initial recognition, these are subsequently  measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest rate method. Gains and losses are  recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities  are derecognised as well as through the  effective interest rate amortisation process.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking  into account any discount or premium on  acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral  part of the effective interest rate. The effective  interest rate amortisation is included as finance  costs in the statement of profit and loss.   2.14.2.3 Der ecognition     A  financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged or  cancelled or expires. When an existing financial  liability is replaced by another from the same  lender on substantially different terms, or the terms  of an existing liability are substantially modified,  such an exchange or modification is treated as  the derecognition of the original liability and the  recognition of a new liability. The difference between  the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of  a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to  another party and the consideration paid, including  any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed,  shall be recognised in profit or loss.   2.14.2.4 R eclassification of financial assets     T he Company determines classification of financial  assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After  initial recognition, no reclassification is made for  financial assets which are equity instruments and  financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt  instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is  a change in the business model for managing those  assets. Changes to the business model are expected  to be infrequent. The Company’s senior management  determines change in the business model as a result  of external or internal changes which are significant  to the Company’s operations. Such changes are  evident to external parties. A change in the business  model occurs when the Company either begins  or ceases to perform an activity that is significant  to its operations. If Company reclassifies financial  assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively  from the reclassification date which is the first day  of the immediately next reporting period following  the change in business model. The Company does  not restate any previously recognised gains, losses  (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)     F or other long-term employee benefits, net total of  the following amounts is recognized in the statement  of profit or loss:   (a)   Service cost   (b)   Net  interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)   (c)   R e-measurements of the net defined benefit  liability (asset) 2.18 Foreign Currency   T ransactions in foreign currencies are converted into the  reported currency of the Company using the exchange  rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and  liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding  at the end of the reporting period are translated at the  exchange rates prevailing as at the end of reporting  period. Exchange differences arising on the settlement  of monetary assets and liabilities or on translating  monetary assets and liabilities at rates different from  those at which they were translated on initial recognition  during the period or in previous financial statements are  recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in  which they arise.   Non-monetary items denomina ted in foreign currency  are valued at the exchange rates prevailing on the date  of transactions. 2.19 Stripping Activity   In  case of opencast mining, the mine waste materials  (“overburden”) which consists of soil and rock on the top  of coal seam is required to be removed to get access  to the coal and its extraction. The process of removing  overburden to access coal is referred to as stripping.  Stripping is necessary to obtain access to coal and  occurs throughout the life of an opencast mine. Stripping  costs during development and production phases are  classified in property, plant, and equipment. Stripping  costs are accounted for separately for individual mines.   T he Company accounts for stripping activities as follows:   S tripping costs during the Development phase   T hese are initial overburden removal costs incurred to  obtain access to coal to be extracted. These costs are  capitalised when it is probable that future economic  benefits will flow to the Group and costs can be  measured reliably. Once the production phase begins,  capitalised development stripping costs are amortised  over the mine life.   S tripping costs during the production phase:   T hese are overburden removal costs incurred after the  mine has been brought to revenue as per the policy  of the group. Stripping costs during the production  phase can give rise to two benefits, the extraction of  coal in the current period and improved access to coal  which will be extracted in future periods. Stripping costs  during the production phase are allocated between the  inventory produced and the stripping activity asset using  a standard strip ratio (overburden-to-coal). The standard  strip ratio is the total volume of overburden expected to  be removed over the life of the mine against the total  coal to be extracted over the life of the mine. When the  actual volume of overburden removed is greater than the  expected volume of overburden removal, the stripping  cost for excess overburden removed over the expected  overburden removal is capitalised to the stripping activity  asset. The stripping activity asset is amortised over the  expected useful life of the mine. Changes in geo-mining  conditions may have an impact on the standard strip ratio.  Changes to the ratio are accounted for prospectively.  Stripping activity asset are shown separately under  Property, plant, and equipment.   S tripping activity asset for stripping costs during the  production phase are recognised in the mines with a rated  capacity of one million tonnes per annum and above. 2.20 Inventories   2.20.1 S tock of Coal     Inventories  of coal/coke are stated at lower of cost  and net realisable value. The cost of inventories are  calculated using the Weighted Average method.  Net realisable value represents the estimated  selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of  completion and costs necessary to make the sale.     Book stock of  coal is considered in the accounts  where the variance between book stock and  measured stock is up to +/- 5% and in cases where  the variance is beyond +/- 5% the measured stock is  considered. Such stocks are valued at net realisable  value or cost whichever is lower. Coke is considered  as a part of the stock of coal.      C  oal & coke-fines are valued at lower of cost or  net realisable value and considered as a part of  the stock of coal.     Slurry (coking/semi-coking),  middling of washeries,  and by products are valued at net realisable value  and considered as a part of the stock of coal.   2.20.2 S tores, Spares, and Other Inventories     T he Stock of stores and spares including other  inventories are valued at cost calculated on the basis  of the weighted average method.     P rovisions are made at the rate of 100% for  unserviceable, damaged and obsolete stores and  spares and at the rate of 50% for stores & spares not  moved for 5 years.   Curr ent and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in which case, the current and deferred tax are also  recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred  tax arises from the initial accounting for a business  combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting  for the business combination.   Deferr ed income tax assets and liabilities are offset  when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current  tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the  deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income  taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the  taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is  an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 2.17 Employee Benefits   2.17.1 Shor t-term Benefits     Shor t-term employee benefits are employee  benefits (other than termination benefits) that are  expected to be settled wholly before twelve months  after the end of the annual reporting period in which  the employees render the related service.     All shor t-term employee benefits are recognized  in the period in which the services are  rendered by employees.   2.17.2 P ost-employment benefits and other long term  employee benefits     2.17.2.1 Defined contributions plans     A defined contribution plan is a post-employment  benefit plan under which the Company pays a  fixed contribution into a fund maintained by a  separate body and the Company will have no  legal or constructive obligation to pay further  amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined  contribution plans are recognised as an employee  benefit expense in the statement of profit and  loss in the periods during which services are  rendered by employees.     2.17.2.2 Defined benefits plans       A  defined benefit plan is a post-employment  benefit plan other than a defined contribution  plan. The Company’s net obligation in respect  of defined benefit plans is calculated by  estimating the amount of future benefit that  employees have earned in return of their  service in the current and prior periods. The  benefit is discounted to determine its present  value and reduced by the fair value of plan  assets, if any. The discount rate is based on the  prevailing market yields of Indian Government  securities as at the reporting date that have  maturity dates approximating the terms  of the Company’s obligations and that are  denominated in the same currency in which  the benefits are expected to be paid.       T he application of actuarial valuation involves  making assumptions about the discount rate,  expected rates of return on assets, future salary  increases, mortality rates etc. Due to the long- term nature of these plans, such estimates  are subject to uncertainties. The calculation  is performed at each balance sheet by an  actuary using the projected unit credit method.  When the calculation results in the benefit to  the Company, the recognised asset is limited  to the present value of the economic benefits  available in the form of any future refunds from  the plan or reduction in future contributions to  the plan. An economic benefit is available to  the Company if it is realisable during the life of  the plan, or on settlement of plan liabilities.       R e-measurement of the net defined benefit  liability, which comprises actuarial gain and  losses considering the return on plan assets  (excluding interest) and the effects of the  assets ceiling (if any, excluding interest)  are recognised immediately in the other  comprehensive income. The Company  determines the net interest expense (income)  on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for  the period by applying the discount rate used  to measure the defined benefit obligation at  the beginning of the annual period to the then  net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into  account any changes in the net defined benefit  liability (asset) during the period as a result  of contributions and benefit payments. Net  interest expense and other expenses related  to defined benefit plans are recognised in  profit and loss.       When the benefits of  the plan are improved,  the portion of the increased benefit relating  to past service by employees is recognised as  an expense immediately in the statement of  profit and loss.   2.17.3 Other long-term employee benefits     Other long-term employee benefits ar e all employee  benefits other than short-term employee benefits,  post-employment benefits and termination benefits.     Other long-term employee benefits include  items which ar e not expected to be settled wholly  before twelve months after the end of the annual  reporting period in which the employees render the  related service.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)         (iii)   ar e neutral, i.e. free from bias;      (iv)   ar e  prudent;  and         (v)   ar e complete in all material respects  on a consistent basis         In making the judgment management   refers to, and considers the applicability of,  the following sources in descending order:         (a)   the r equirements in Ind ASs dealing  with similar and related issues; and      (b)   the  definitions,  recognition  criteria  and measurement concepts for  assets, liabilities, income, and  expenses in the Framework.         In making the judgment,  management  considers the most recent pronouncements  of the International Accounting Standards  Board and in the absence thereof those of  the other standard-setting bodies that use  a similar conceptual framework to develop  accounting standards, other accounting  literature, and accepted industry practices,  to the extent that these do not conflict  with the Indian accounting Standard and  accounting policies and practices as stated  in above paragraph.         T he Company operates in the mining sector  (a sector where the exploration, evaluation,  and development production phases are  based on the varied topographical and  geo-mining terrain spread over the lease  period running over decades and prone  to constant changes), the accounting  policies whereof have evolved based on  specific industry practices supported by  research committees and approved by the  various regulators owing to its consistent  application over the last several decades.  In the absence of specific accounting  literature, guidance and standards in  certain specific areas which are in the  process of evolution, the Company  continues to strive to develop accounting  policies in line with the development  of accounting literature and any  development therein shall be accounted  for prospectively as per the procedure laid  down above more, particularly in Ind AS 8.    2.24.1.2  Materiality       Ind  AS applies to items which are material.  Management uses judgement in deciding  whether individual items or groups of item are  material in the financial statements. Materiality  is judged by reference to the nature or  magnitude or both of the items. The deciding  factor is whether omitting or misstating or  obscuring an information could individually or  in combination with other information influence  decisions that primary users make on the basis  of the financial statements. Management also  uses judgement of materiality for determining  the compliance requirement of the Ind AS.  Further, the Company may also be required  to present separately immaterial items when  required by law.       With  effect from 01.04.2019 Errors/omissions  discovered during the year relating to prior  periods are treated as immaterial and adjusted  during the year, if all such errors and omissions  in aggregate does not exceed 1% of total  revenue from Operation (net of statutory levies)  as per the last audited financial statement  of the Company.     2.24.1.3 Oper ating lease        C  ompany has entered into lease agreements.  The Company has determined, based on an  evaluation of the terms and conditions of  the arrangements, such as the lease term not  constituting a major part of the economic life  of the commercial property and the fair value  of the asset, that it retains all the significant  risks and rewards of ownership of these  properties and accounts for the contracts as  operating leases.     2.24.2 Estima tes and assumptions       T he key assumptions concerning the future  and other key sources of estimation uncertainty  at the reporting date, that have a significant risk  of causing a material adjustment to the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities within the  next financial year, are described below. The  Company based its assumptions and estimates  on parameters available when the standalone  financial statements were prepared. Existing  circumstances and assumptions about future  developments, however, may change due  to market changes or circumstances arising  that are beyond the control of the Company.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur.     The  estimates,  judgements  and  associated  assumptions are based on historical experience  and other factors that are considered to  be relevant. Actual results may differ from  these estimates. 2.21 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets   P rovisions are recognized when the Company has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a  past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation and  a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can  be made. Where the time value of money is material,  provisions are stated at the present value of the  expenditure expected to settle the obligation.   All pr ovisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date  and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.   Wher e it is not probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be  estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a  contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of  economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose  existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or  non-occurrence of one or more future uncertain events  not wholly within the control of the Company, are also  disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability  of outflow of economic benefits is remote.    C  ontingent assets are possible assets that arise from past  events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain  future events not wholly within the control of the  Company. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial  statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable  on the basis of the judgment of management. These are  assessed continually to ensure that developments are  appropriately reflected in the financial statements. 2.22 Earnings per share   Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the net  profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity  shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per  shares is computed by dividing the profit after tax by the  weighted average number of equity shares considered for  deriving basic Earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been  issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. 2.23 Stripping activity provision (Ratio Variance)   S tripping activity provision recognized earlier is based on  the policy followed consistently by CIL since its inception.  Stripping activity provision was recognized or reversed  based on the current ratio of OB to Coal as compared  to the average Stripping ratio (Standard ratio) of the  mine. This accounting method has been substantiated  and validated by a multitude of authoritative bodies and  forums, including income tax authorities.   T he carrying amount of the stripping activity provision is  reversed systematically whenever the situation of reversal  arises on extraction of actual volume of overburden over  expected volume thereof. Such reversal is specific to  mines at the rate the said provision has been recognized. 2.24 Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions   T he preparation of the financial statements in conformity  with Ind AS requires management to make estimates,  judgments, and assumptions that affect the application  of accounting policies and the reported amounts of  assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets  and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the  amount of revenue and expenses during the reported  period. Application of accounting policies involving  complex and subjective judgements and the use of  assumptions in these financial statements have been  disclosed. Accounting estimates could change from  period to period. Actual results could differ from those  estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognised in the period in which the  estimates are revised and, if material, their effects are  disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.   2.24.1 Judgements     In the pr ocess of applying the Company’s accounting  policies, management has made the following  judgments, which have the most significant effect on  the amounts recognised in the financial statements:     2.24.1.1 F ormulation of Accounting Policies       Accounting policies ar e formulated in a manner  that results in financial statements containing  relevant and reliable information about the  transactions, other events and conditions  to which they apply. Those policies need  not be applied when the effect of applying  them is immaterial.       In the absence of  an Ind AS that specifically  applies to a transaction, other event or  condition, management has used its judgment  in developing and applying an accounting  policy that results in information that is:       a)   r elevant to the economic decision-making  needs of users and       b)   r eliable in that financial statements: and      (i)   r epresent  faithfully  the  financial  position, financial performance and  cash flows of the Company;       (ii)   r eflect  the  economic  substance  of transactions, other eventsand  conditions, and not merely  the legal form; Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 414 415 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Revisions to  accounting estimates are recognised in the  period in which the estimate is revised and  future periods affected.       T he application of accounting policies that  require critical judgements and accounting  estimates involving complex and subjective  judgements and the use of assumptions in  these standalone financial statements have  been disclosed here in below:     2.24.2.1 Impairment of  non-financial assets       T here is an indication of impairment if, the  carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit  exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the  higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and  its value in use. Company considers individual  mines as separate cash generating units for the  purpose of test of impairment.  The value in use  calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash  flows are derived from the budget for the next five  years and do not include restructuring activities  that the Company is not yet committed to or  significant future investments that will enhance  the asset’s performance of the Cash Generating  Unit (CGU) being tested. The recoverable  amount is sensitive to the discount rate used  for the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model as  well as the expected future cash-inflows and the  growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.  These estimates are most relevant to other  mining infrastructures. The key assumptions  used to determine the recoverable amount for  the different CGUs, are disclosed and further  explained in respective notes.    2.24.2.2  Income  Taxes     Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax  losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable  profit will be available against which the losses can  be utilised. Significant management judgement is  required to determine the amount of deferred tax  assets that can be recognised, based upon the  likely timing and the level of future taxable profits  together with future tax planning strategies.     2.24.2.3 Defined  benefit plans and long term  employee benefits       T he cost of the defined benefit plan and other  post-employment medical benefits and the  present value of the obligations are determined  using actuarial valuations. An actuarial  valuation involves making various assumptions  that may differ from actual developments in  the future. These include the determination of  the discount rate, future salary increases and  mortality rates.       Due to the comple xities involved in the  valuation and its long-term nature, a defined  benefit obligation is highly sensitive to  changes in these assumptions. All assumptions  are reviewed at each reporting date. The  parameter most subject to change is the  discount rate. In determining the appropriate  discount rate for plans operated in India, the  management considers the interest rates of  government bonds in currencies consistent  with the currencies of the post-employment  benefit obligation.       T he mortality rate is based on publicly  available mortality tables of the country. Those  mortality tables tend to change only at interval  in response to demographic changes.     2.24.2.4 Intangible asset under development       T he Company capitalises intangible asset  under development for a project in accordance  with the accounting policy. Initial capitalisation  of costs is based on management’s judgement  that technological and economic feasibility  is confirmed, usually when a project report is  formulated and approved.     2.24.2.5 P rovision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration  and Decommissioning Obligation       In determining the fair value of  the provision  for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and  Decommissioning Obligation, assumptions  and estimates are made in relation to discount  rates, the expected cost of site restoration and  dismantling and the expected timing of those  costs. The Company estimates provision using  the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method  considering life of the project/mine based on 	  Estimated cost per hectare as specified  in guidelines issued by Ministry of Coal,  Government of India 	  The discount rate (pre-tax rate) that reflect  current market assessments of the time  value of money and the risks specific  to the liability.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE) NOTE – 16: ADDITIONAL NOTES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED  31-03-2025 (Contd..)   A  brief of each level is given below.   L evel 1:  Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments  measured using quoted prices.   L evel 2:  The fair value of financial instruments that are not  traded in an active market is determined using valuation  techniques which maximize the use of observable  market data and rely as little as possible on entity- specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair  value an instrument are observable, the instrument is  included in level 2.   T his includes Mutual fund which is valued using closing  Net Asset Value (NAV) as at the reporting date.   L evel 3:  If one or more of the significant inputs is not  based on observable market data, the instrument is  included in level 3. This is the case for investments,  security deposits and other liabilities included in level 3. (c)    V aluation technique used in determining fair value   V aluation techniques used to value financial instruments  include the use of quoted market prices (NAV) of  instruments in respect of investment in Mutual Funds. (d)   F air value measurements using significant unobservable  inputs   At pr esent there are no fair value measurements using  significant unobservable inputs. (e)    F air values of financial assets and liabilities measured at  amortised cost   T he carrying amounts of trade receivables, short term  deposits, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables are  considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their  short-term nature.   T he Company  considers  that the Security Deposits  does not include a significant financing component.  The security deposits coincide with the company’s  performance and the contract requires amounts to  be retained for reasons other than the provision of  finance.  The withholding of a specified percentage  of each milestone payment is intended to protect the  interest of the company, from the contractor failing to  adequately complete its obligations under the contract.  Accordingly,  transaction  cost of Security deposit is  considered as fair value at initial recognition  and  subsequently measured at amortised cost.   Significant estima tes: The fair value of financial  instruments that are not traded in an active market is  determined using valuation techniques. The Company  uses its judgment to select a method and makes suitable  assumptions at the end of each reporting period. 4   F inancial Risk Management   F inancial risk management objectives and policies   T he Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise  trade and other payables. The main purpose of these  financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations  and to provide guarantees to support its operations.

(III)   Other L ong Term Employee Benefits   a)   L eave encashment     T he company provides benefit of total Earned Leave  (EL) of 30 days and Half Paid Leave (HPL) of 20 days  to the executives of the company, accrued and  credited proportionately on half yearly basis on the  first day of January and July of every year. During  the service, 75% EL credited balance is one time  encashable in each calendar year subject to ceiling of  maximum 60 days EL encashment. Accumulated HPL  is not permitted for encashment during the period  of service. On superannuation, EL and HPL together  is considered for encashment subject to the overall  limit of 300 days without commutation of HPL. In case  of non-executives, Leave encashment is governed by  the National Coal Wage Agreement (NCWA) and at  present the workmen are entitled to get encashment  of earned leave at the rate of 15 days per year and on  discontinuation of service due to death, retirement,  superannuation and VRS, the balance leave or 150  days whichever is less, is allowed for encashment.  Therefore, the liabilities for earned leave are  expected to be settled during the service as well as  after the retirement of employee. They are therefore  measured as the present value of expected future  payments to be made in respect of services provided  by employees up to the end of the reporting period  using the projected unit credit method. The benefits  are discounted using the market yields at the end of  the reporting period that have terms approximating  to the terms of the related obligation. The scheme  is funded by qualifying insurance policies from Life  Insurance Corporation of India. The liability under  the scheme is borne by the Company as per actuarial  valuation at each reporting date.   b)   Life C over Scheme (LCS)     As a  part of the social security scheme, the Group  has a Life Cover Scheme known as “Life Cover  Scheme of Coal India Limited” (LCS) which covers all  the executive and non-executive cadre employees.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are  presented in Indian Rupees ( H ) and all values are rounded  off to the ‘rupees in crore’ up to two decimal points. 2.2   Basis of  consolidation 2.2.1 Subsidiaries   i.   Subsidiaries ar e entities over which the Group has  control and the Control is achieved when the group  is exposed or has rights, to variable returns from its  involvement with the investee and has the ability to  affect those returns through its:     a.   P ower over the investee;     b .   Exposur e or rights to variable returns from its  involvement with the investee; and     c.   T he ability to use its power over the investee to  affect its returns.     Subsidiaries  are consolidated from the date when  control over the subsidiary is acquired and they are  discontinued from the date of cessation of control.   ii.   T he Group combines the financial statements of the  Holding and its subsidiaries based on a line-by-line  consolidation by adding together the book value  of like items of assets and liabilities, revenue and  expenses as per the respective financial statements.  Intra-group balances, intra-group transactions, and  the unrealised profits on stocks arising out of intra- group transactions have been eliminated.   iii.   T he consolidated financial statements are prepared  using uniform accounting policies for similar  material transactions and other events in similar  circumstances otherwise as stated elsewhere. Where  the accounting policies of subsidiaries are different  from those of the Group, appropriate adjustments  are made for like transactions and events in similar  circumstances to ensure conformity with the policies  adopted by the group.   iv .   T he difference between the costs of investment  in the subsidiaries, over the net assets at the time  of acquisition of shares in the subsidiaries is  recognised in the consolidated financial statements  as Goodwill or Capital reserve as the case may be.  The said goodwill is not amortised, however, it is  tested for impairment at each balance sheet date,  and impairment loss, if any is recognised in the  consolidated financial statements.   v .   Non-contr olling interest's share of the net profit of  subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted  against the revenue of the Group in order to arrive  at the net revenue attributable to the owners of the  Holding Company. The excess of loss for the year  over the non-controlling interest is adjusted in the  owner's interest.   vi.   Non-contr olling interest's share of net assets  of subsidiaries is identified and presented  in the Consolidated Balance Sheet separate  from liabilities and the equity of the Holding  Company's shareholders.   vii.   A  change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary  which does not result in a loss of control, is  accounted for as an equity transaction.   viii.   If  the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it  derecognizes the assets, liabilities, carrying amount  of any non-controlling interests and the cumulative  translation differences recorded in equity. Any  interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured  at fair value with effect from the date the control is  lost, with the resulting gain/ loss recognised in the  statement of Profit & Loss.   Business C ombination and Goodwill   T he Group except for combination of group entities  which are under common control applies the acquisition  method in accounting for business combinations. The  consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control  of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition- date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred  and the equity interests issued by the Group, which  includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a  contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs  are expensed as incurred. Assets acquired and liabilities  assumed are generally measured at their acquisition  date fair values.   In case of  combination of entities under control, business  combination are accounted for under pooling of interest  method whereby the assets and liabilities are combined  at the carrying amount and no adjustments are made  to reflect their fair values or recognise any new assets  or liabilities.   Af ter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less  any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose  of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business  combination is, from the combination date, allocated  to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are  expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective  of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquire are  assigned to those units. 2.2.2 Associates   Associa tes are all entities over which the Company has  significant influence but no control or joint control. This  is generally the case where the Company holds between  20% and 50% of the voting rights.   Investments in associa tes are accounted for using  the equity method of accounting, after initially being  recognised at cost, except when the investment, or a  portion thereof, classified as held for sale, in which case it  is accounted in accordance with Ind AS 105.   T he Group impairs its net investment in the associates on  the basis of objective evidence. 2.2.3 Joint arrangements   Joint arr angements are those arrangements where the  Group is having joint control with one or more other parties.   Joint contr ol is the contractually agreed sharing of control  of the arrangement which exist only when decisions about  the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of  the parties sharing control.   Joint  Arrangements are classified as either joint  operations or joint ventures. The classification depends  on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor,  rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) 2.2. 4 Joint Operations   A  joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties  that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to  the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to  the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed  sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only  when decisions about the relevant activities require  unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.   T he group recognises its direct right to the assets,  liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and  its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities,  revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated  in the financial statements on line by line basis with  similar items in the consolidated financial statements or  otherwise under the appropriate heads of accounts. 2.2.5 Joint ventures   i)   A  joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby parties  that have joint control of the arrangement having  rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests  in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and  thereafter accounted for using the equity method.   ii)   Investments  in Joint venture are accounted for using  the equity method of accounting, after initially being  recognized at cost, except when the investment, or a  portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which  case it is accounted in accordance with Ind AS 105.   iii)   T he Group impairs its net investment in the joint  venture on the basis of objective evidence, When  the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals  or exceeds its investment in the entity, including any  other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group  does not recognise further losses, unless it has  incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of  the joint venture.   iv)   Unr ealised gains on transactions between the Group  and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the  Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses on  transactions between the Group and its joint ventures  are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest  in these entities unless the transaction provides  evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.  Where the accounting policies of joint ventures  are different from those of the Group, appropriate  adjustments are made for like transactions and events  in similar circumstances to ensure conformity with the  policies adopted by the group.   v)   Any gain or loss on dilution arising on a r educed  stake in the joint venture, but still retaining the  joint control, is recognized in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.   vi)   When  the investment ceases to be a joint venture  and the retained interest is a financial asset, the  Group measures the retained interest at fair value  with the change in carrying amount recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss. The fair value of the  retained interest becomes the initial carrying amount  for the purpose of accounting for the retained  interest as a financial asset. Any amounts previously  recognised in other comprehensive income in  respect of that joint venture are reclassified to the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 2.2.6 Equity Method   Under the equity method of  accounting, the investments  are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for  the post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the  net assets of the investee. The Group’s share of the post- acquisition profits or losses and other comprehensive  income of the investee are included in the Statement  of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income of  the Group. Dividends received or receivable from joint  ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying  amount of the investment.   When the Gr oup’s share of losses in an equity-accounted  investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity,  including any other unsecured long-term receivables,  the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it  has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of  the other entity 2.2.7 Changes in ownership interests   T he Group treats transactions with non-controlling  interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions  with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership  interest results in an adjustment between the carrying  amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests  to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any  difference between the amount of the adjustment to non- controlling interests and any fair value of consideration  paid or received is recognised within equity   When the Gr oup ceases to consolidate or equity account  for an investment because of a loss of control, joint  control or significant influence, any retained interest in  the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change  in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This  fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the  purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained  interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.  In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other  comprehensive income in respect of that entity are  accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the  related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts  previously recognised in other comprehensive income  are reclassified to profit or loss.   If  the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate  is reduced but joint control or significant influence is  retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts  previously recognised in other comprehensive income  are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate. 2.3   Curr ent and Non-Current Classification   T he Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance  Sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An  asset is treated as current by the group when:   (a)   it e xpects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or  consume it, in its normal operating cycle;   (b)   it holds the asset primarily for the purpose  of trading;   (c)   it e xpects to realise the asset within twelve months  after the reporting period; or   (d)   the asset is cash or a cash equivalent (as defined in  Ind  AS 7) unless the asset is restricted from being  exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least  twelve months after the reporting period.   All other assets ar e classified as non-current.   A  liability is treated as current by the group when:   (a)   it e xpects to settle the liability in its normal  operating cycle;   (b)   it holds the liability primarily for the  purpose of  trading;   (c)   the liability is due to be set tled within twelve months  after the reporting period; or   (d)   it does not have an unconditional right to defer  set tlement of the liability for at least twelve months  after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that  could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its  settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not  affect its classification.   All other liabilities ar e classified as non-current.   Having r egard to the nature of the business being carried  out by the group, the group has ascertained its operating  cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current and  non-current classification of assets and liabilities. 2.4   R evenue recognition   R evenue from contracts with customers   R evenue is principally derived from the sale of coal, related  ancillary services, and products. Revenue from sales of  products is recognized when control of the products has  transferred, being when the products are delivered to  the customer. Delivery occurs when the products have  been shipped or delivered to the specific location as the  case may be, and the risks of loss have been transferred  in accordance with the sales contract. The amount of  revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which  the Group is or expects to be entitled in exchange for  those goods or services. Accumulated experience is used  to estimate and provide for the variable consideration as  per the sales contract, and revenue is only recognized  to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant  reversal will not occur. The amount of consideration does  not contain a significant financing component as payment  terms are less than one year as per the sales contracts.   T he group has a number of long-term contracts to supply  products to customers in future periods. Generally,  revenue is recognized on an invoice basis, as each unit  sold is a separate performance obligation, and therefore  the right to consideration from a customer corresponds  directly with performance completed to date.   Interest   Inter est income from a financial asset is recognized when it  is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group  and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest  income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal  outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which  is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash  receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that  asset's net carrying amount on initial recognition.   Dividends   Dividend is r ecognised when the company’s right to  receive the payment is established, which is generally  when shareholders approve the dividend.   Other Claims   R evenue in respect of Other claims (including interest  on delayed realization from customers) are recognized  only when there is reasonable certainty as to the ultimate  collection and the amount can be measured reliably. 2.5   Gr ants from Government   Government Gr ants are not recognised until there is  reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the  conditions attached to them and that there is reasonable  certainty that grants will be received.   Government  grants are recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which  the Group recognises the related expenses or costs for  which the grants are intended to compensate.   Government Gr ants related to assets are presented in the  balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income  and are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on  systematic basis over the useful life of asset.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)   Gr ants related to income (i.e. grant related to other than  assets) are presented as part of statement of profit and  loss under the head ‘Other Income’.   A  government grant/assistance that becomes receivable  as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred  or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support  to the Group with no future related costs, is recognised in  profit or loss of the period in which it becomes receivable.   T he Government grants or grants in the nature of  promoter’s contribution is recognised directly in “Capital  Reserve” which forms part of the “Shareholders fund”. 2.6   Leases   A  contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys  the right to control the use of an identified asset for a  period of time in exchange for consideration. 2.6.1 Group as a lessee   T he Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease,  at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a  lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use  of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for  consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the  right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group  assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an  identified asset (ii) the Group has substantially all of the  economic benefits from use of the asset through the  period of the lease and (iii) the Group has the right to  direct the use of the asset.   At the commencement da te, a lessee shall recognise a  right-of-use asset at cost and a lease liability at the present  value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date  for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or  the underlying asset is of low value.   Subsequently , right-of-use asset is measured using  cost model whereas, the lease liability is measured by  increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the  lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect  the lease payments made and re-measuring the carrying  amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications   T he lease liability is initially measured at amortized  cost at the present value of the future lease payments.  The lease payments are discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable,  using the incremental borrowing rates of these leases.  Lease liabilities are premeasured with a corresponding  adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group  changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an  extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU  asset are separately presented in the Balance Sheet and  lease payments are classified as financing cash flows.  Lease liability obligations is presented separately under  the head "Financial Liabilities".   F inance charges are recognised in finance costs in the  Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the costs are included  in the carrying amount of another asset applying other  applicable standards.   Right-of-use asset is depr eciated over the useful life of  the asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the asset to  the lessee by the end of the lease term or if the cost of  the right-to-use asset reflects that the lessee will exercise  a purchase option. Otherwise, the lessee shall depreciate  the right-to-use asset from the commencement date to  the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use  asset or the end of the lease term. 2.6.2 Group as a lessor   Assets ar e given on lease either as finance lease or  operating lease.   F inance Lease: A lease is classified as finance lease if it  transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental  to ownership of an underlying asset. Initially, asset held  under finance lease is recognised in Balance Sheet and  presented as a receivable at an amount equal to the net  investment in the lease. Finance income is recognised  over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting  a constant periodic rate of return on Group's net  investment in the lease.   Oper ating Lease: A lease which is not classified as a  finance lease is an operating lease. The Group recognises  lease payments in case of assets given on operating  leases as income on a straight line basis. 2.7   Non-curr ent assets held for sale   T he Group classifies non-current assets and (or disposal  groups) as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be  recovered principally through a sale rather than through  continuing use. Actions required to complete the sale  should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes  to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be  withdrawn. Management must be committed to the sale  expected to be completed within one year from the date  of classification.   F or these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges  of non-current assets for other non-current assets when  the exchange has commercial substance. The criteria for  held for sale classification is regarded met only when the  assets or disposal group is available for immediate sale  in its present condition, subject only to terms that are  usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal  groups), its sale is highly probable; and it will genuinely  be sold, not abandoned. The Group treats sale of the  asset or disposal group to be highly probable when: 	  The appropriate level of management is committed  to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), 	  An active programme to locate a buyer and  complete the plan has been initiated 	  The asset (or disposal group) is being actively  marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in  relation to its current fair value, 	  The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as  a completed sale within one year from the date of  classification, and 	  Actions required to complete the plan indicate that  it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will  be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.   Non-curr ent asset or disposal groups classified as held  for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and  fair value less costs to sell. 2.8   P roperty, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and  Depreciation/Amortisation   An item of  PPE is recognized as an asset if it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.   PPE  are initially measured at cost of acquisition/ construction including decommissioning or restoration  cost wherever required. Cost of land includes expenditures  which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the  land like, rehabilitation expenses, resettlement cost  and compensation in lieu of employment incurred for  concerned displaced persons etc.   Af ter recognition, an item of all other Property, plant and  equipment are carried at its cost less any accumulated  depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses  under Cost Model. The cost of an item of property, plant  and equipment comprises:   (a)   its pur chase price, including import duties and non- refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade  discounts and rebates.   (b)   any costs dir ectly attributable to bringing the  asset to the location and condition necessary  for it to be capable of operating in the manner  intended by management.   (c)   the initial estima te of the costs of dismantling and  removing the item and restoring the site on which it  is located, the obligation for which the Group incurs  either when the item is acquired or as a consequence  of having used the item during a particular period  for purposes other than to produce inventories  during that period.   (d)   Inter est on Borrowings utilized to finance the  construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as  part of cost of the asset until such time that the asset  is ready for its intended use.   Each par t of an item of property, plant and equipment  with a cost that is significant in relation to the total  cost of the item is depreciated separately. However,  significant part(s) of an item of PPE having same useful  life and depreciation method are grouped together in  determining the depreciation charge.    C  osts of the day to-day servicing described as ‘repairs and  maintenance’ are recognised in the statement of profit  and loss in the period in which the same are incurred.   Subsequent cost of  replacing parts which are significant  in relation to the total cost of an item of property, plant  and equipment are recognised in the carrying amount of  the item, if it is probable that future economic benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Group; and  the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The  carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is  derecognised in accordance with the derecognition  policy mentioned below.   When major inspection is performed,  its cost is recognised  in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and  equipment as a replacement if it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with the item will flow to  the Group; and the cost of the item can be measured  reliably. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of  the previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts)  is derecognised.   An item of  Property, plant or equipment is derecognised  upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are  expected from the continuing use of assets. Any gain or  loss arising on such derecognition of an item of property  plant and equipment is recognised in the statement of  profit and Loss.   Depr eciation on property, plant and equipment,  except freehold land, is provided as per cost model on  straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the  asset as follows: Assets Useful Life Other Land (incl. Leasehold Land) Life of the project  or lease term  whichever is lower Building (incl. Roads) 3-60 years Telecommunication 3-9 years Railway Sidings 15 years Plant and Equipment 1-30 years (incl. Railway Corridor, Others) Computers and Laptops 3 Years Office equipment 3-5 years Furniture and Fixtures 10 years Vehicles 8-10 years Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 476 477 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)   Based on technical evalua tion, the management believes  that the useful lives given above best represent the period  over which the management expects to use the asset.  Hence the useful lives of the assets may be different from  the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II  of the companies act, 2013.   T he estimated useful life of the assets is reviewed at the  end of each financial year.   T he residual value of Property, plant and equipment  is considered as 5% of the original cost of the asset  except for some items of assets such as other land, site  restoration asset, other mining infrastructure, surveyed  off assets. Useful life has been technically estimated to  be one year with nil residual value for items such as Coal  tub, winding ropes, haulage ropes, stowing pipes and  safety lamps etc.   Depr eciation on the assets added/disposed of during the  year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the  month of addition / disposal.   V alue of “Other Land” includes land acquired under Coal  Bearing Area (Acquisition & Development) (CBA) Act, 1957,  Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Right to Fair Compensation  and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and  Resettlement (RFCTLAAR) Act, 2013, Long term transfer of  government land etc., which are amortised on the basis of  the balance life of the project; and in case of Leasehold  land such amortisation is based on lease period or balance  life of the project whichever is lower.   Assets tha t are fully depreciated and retired from active  use are disclosed separately as surveyed off assets at its  residual value under Property, Plant Equipment and are  tested for impairment.   T ransition to Ind AS   T he Group elected to continue with the carrying value  as per the cost model (for all of its property, plant and  equipment as recognised in the financial statements  as at the date of transition to Ind ASs, measured as per  the previous GAAP. 2.9   Mine Closur e, Site Restoration and  Decommissioning Obligation   T he Group’s obligation for land reclamation and  decommissioning of structures consists of spending at  both surface and underground mines in accordance with  the guidelines from the Ministry of Coal, Government  of India. The Group estimates its obligation for Mine  Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning based  upon detailed calculation and technical assessment of the  amount and timing of the future cash spending to perform  the required work. Mine Closure expenditure is provided  as per approved Mine Closure Plan. The estimates of  expenses are escalated for inflation, and then discounted  at a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of  the time value of money and the risks, such that the amount  of provision reflects the present value of the expenditures  expected to be incurred to settle the obligation. The Group  records a corresponding asset associated with the liability  for final reclamation and mine closure. The obligation  and corresponding assets are recognised in the period in  which the liability is incurred. The asset representing the  total site restoration cost (as estimated by Central Mine  Planning and Design Institute Limited) as per the mine  closure plan is recognised as a separate item in PPE and  amortised over the balance project/mine life.   T he value of the provision is progressively increased over  time as the effect of discounting unwinds; creating an  expense recognised as a financial expense.   F urther, a specific escrow fund account is maintained for  this purpose as per the approved mine closure plan.   T he progressive mine closure expenses incurred on  year to year basis forming part of the total mine closure  obligation are initially recognised as receivable from  the escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the  obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn  after the concurrence of the certifying agency. 2.10 Exploration and Evaluation Assets   Explor ation and evaluation assets comprise costs that are  attributable to the search for coal and related resources,  pending the determination of technical feasibility and  the assessment of commercial viability of an identified  resource which comprises inter alia the following: 	  acquisition of rights to explore 	  researching and analysing historical exploration data; 	  gathering exploration data through topographical,  geo-chemical and geo-physical studies; 	  exploratory drilling, trenching, and sampling; 	  determining and examining the volume and grade  of the resource; 	  surveying transportation and  infrastructure requirements; 	  Conducting market and finance studies.   T he above includes employee remuneration, cost of  materials and fuel used, payments to contractors etc.   As the intangible component r epresents an insignificant/ indistinguishable portion of the overall expected  tangible costs to be incurred and recouped from future  exploitation, these costs along with other capitalised  exploration costs are recorded as exploration and  evaluation assets.   Explor ation and evaluation costs are capitalised on a  project-by-project basis pending the determination  of technical feasibility and commercial viability of the  project and disclosed as a separate line item under non- current assets. They are subsequently measured at cost  less accumulated impairment/provision.   Once pr oved reserves are determined and the  development of mines/projects are sanctioned,  exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to  “Development” under capital work in progress. However,  if proved reserves are not determined, the exploration  and evaluation asset is derecognised. 2.11 Development Expenditure   When pr oved reserves are determined and the  development of mines/projects are sanctioned,  capitalised exploration and evaluation cost is  recognised as assets under construction and disclosed  as a component of capital work in progress under the  head “Development”. All subsequent development  expenditure is also capitalised. The development  expenditure capitalised is net of proceeds from the sale  of coal extracted during the development phase.    C  ommercial Operation   T he project/mines are brought to revenue; when  commercial readiness of a project/mine to yield  production on a sustainable basis is established either on  the basis of conditions specifically stated in the project  report or on the basis of the following criteria:   (a)   F rom the beginning of the financial year immediately  after the year in which the project achieves physical  output of 25% of rated capacity as per the approved  project report, or   (b)   2 ye ars of touching coal, or   (c)   F rom the beginning of the financial year in which the  value of production is more than total, expenses.   Whichever event occurs first;   On being br ought to revenue, the assets under capital  work in progress are reclassified as a component of  property, plant, and equipment under the nomenclature  “Other Mining Infrastructure”. Other Mining infrastructures  are amortised from the year when the mine is brought  under revenue in 20 years or the working life of the  project whichever is less. 2.12 Intangible Assets and Amortisation   Intangible assets acquir ed separately are measured  on initial recognition at cost. Cost includes any directly  attributable expenses necessary to make the assets  ready for its intended use. After initial recognition,  intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.   Subsequent  expenditure is recognized as an increase in  the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that  future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred  will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.   An item  of Intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal  or when no future economic benefits are expected from  its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from the  derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as  the difference between the net disposal proceeds and  the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset  is derecognised.   Internally gener ated intangibles, excluding capitalised  development costs, are not capitalised. Instead, the  related expenditure is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss and other comprehensive income in the  period in which the expenditure is incurred.   T he useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either  finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are  amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed  for impairment whenever there is an indication that the  intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation  period and the amortisation method for an intangible  asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the  end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected  useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of  future economic benefits embodied in the asset are  considered to modify the amortisation period or method,  as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting  estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets  with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit  and loss. Amortisation of intangible asset is provided on  straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the  intangible asset as follows: Intangible Assets Useful Life SAP/ERP 6 years Other Computer Software License period Rail Corridor  Life as per MoU contract  period   An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is  not amor tised but is tested for impairment at each  reporting date.   Explor ation and Evaluation assets attributable to blocks  identified for sale or proposed to be sold to outside  agencies (i.e. for blocks not earmarked for CIL) are  however, classified as Intangible Assets and tested  for impairment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) product or process is technically and commercially  feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the  Group intends to & has sufficient resources to complete  development and to use or sell the asset. 2.13 Impairment of Assets (other than financial assets)   T he Group assesses at the end of each reporting  period whether there is any indication that an asset may  be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group  estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. An asset’s  recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s or cash- generating unit’s value in use and its fair value less costs  of disposal, and is determined for an individual asset,  unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that  are largely independent of those from other assets or  groups of assets, in which case the recoverable amount  is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the  asset belongs. The group considers individual mines  as separate cash-generating units for the purpose of a  test of impairment.   If  the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to  be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and  the impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. 2.14 Investment Property   P roperty (land or a building or part of a building or  both) held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or  both, rather than for, use in the production or supply of  goods or services or for administrative purposes; or sale  in the ordinary course of businesses are classified as an  investment property.   Investment pr operty is measured initially at its cost,  including related transaction costs and where applicable  borrowing costs.   Investment pr operties are depreciated using the straight- line method over their estimated useful lives. 2.15 Financial Instruments   A  financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to  a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or  equity instrument of another entity. 2.15.1 Financial assets 2.15.1.1 Initial recognition and measurement     All financial assets ar e recognised initially at fair  value, in the case of financial assets not recorded  at fair value through profit or loss, plus transaction  costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the  financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets  that require delivery of assets within a time frame  established by regulation or convention in the  market place (regular way trades) are recognised on  the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits  to purchase or sell the asset. However, trade  receivables that do not contain a significant financing  component are measured at transaction price. 2.15.1.2 Subsequent measurement     F or purposes of subsequent measurement, financial  assets are classified in four categories: 	  Debt instruments at amortised cost 	  Debt instruments at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 	  Debt instruments, derivatives and equity  instruments at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL) 	  Equity instruments measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 2.15.1.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost     A  ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met:     a)   T he asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for collecting  contractual cash flows, and     b)    C  ontractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the  principal amount outstanding.     Af ter initial measurement, such financial assets are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost  is calculated by taking into account any discount or  premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an  integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included  in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising  from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. 2.15.1.2.2 Debt instrument at FVTOCI     A  ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if  both of the following criteria are met:     a)   T he objective of the business model is  achieved both by collecting contractual cash  flows and selling the financial assets, and     b)   T he asset’s contractual cash flows  represent SPPI.     Debt instruments included within the FVT OCI  category are measured initially as well as at each  reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are  recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI).  However, the Group recognizes interest income,  impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange  gain or loss in the P&L. On derecognition of the asset,  cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI  is reclassified from the equity to P&L. Interest earned  whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as  interest income using the EIR method. 2.15.1.2.3 Debt instrument at FVTPL     FVTPL  is a residual category for debt instruments.  Any debt instrument, which does not meet the  criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as  FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.     In addition,  the Group may elect to designate a debt  instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or  FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election  is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a  measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred  to as ‘accounting mismatch’). The Group has not  designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.     Debt instruments included within the FVTPL   category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognized in the P&L. 2.15.1.2.4    Equity investments in subsidiaries,  associates and  Joint Ventures     In accor dance of Ind AS 101 (First time adoption of  Ind AS), the carrying amount of these investments  as per previous GAAP as on the date of transition  is considered to be the deemed cost. Subsequently  Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint  ventures are measured at cost.     In case of  consolidated financial statement, Equity  investments in associates and joint ventures are  accounted as per equity method as prescribed in  para 10 of Ind AS 28. 2.15.1.2.5 Other Equity Investment     All other equity investments in scope of  Ind AS 109  are measured at fair value through profit or loss.     T he Group may make an irrevocable election to  present in other comprehensive income subsequent  changes in the fair value. The Group makes such  election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The  classification is made on initial recognition and  is irrevocable.     All fair value changes of  an equity instrument  classified at FVTOCI, are recognized in OCI. There is  no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and  losses to the Statement of Profit and Loss. However,  the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss  within equity. Dividends from such investments are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as  “other income” when the Group’s right to receive  payments is established.     Equity instruments included within the FVTPL   category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognized in the P&L. 2.15.1.3 Derecognition     A  financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a  financial asset or part of a group of similar financial  assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from  the balance sheet) when: 	  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset  have expired, or 	  The Group has transferred its rights to receive  cash flows from the asset or has assumed an  obligation to pay the received cash flows in full  without material delay to a third party under a  ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the  Group has transferred substantially all the risks  and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has  neither transferred nor retained substantially  all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has  transferred control of the asset.     When the Gr oup has transferred its rights to receive  cash flows from an asset or has entered into a  pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to  what extent it has retained the risks and rewards  of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor  retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of  the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the  Group continues to recognise the transferred asset  to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement.  In that case, the Group also recognises an associated  liability. The transferred asset and the associated  liability are measured on a basis that reflects the  rights and obligations that the Group has retained.  Continuing involvement that takes the form of a  guarantee over the transferred asset is measured  at the lower of the original carrying amount of the  asset and the maximum amount of consideration  that the Group could be required to repay. 2.15.1.4 Impairment of financial assets (other than fair value)     In accor dance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies  expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement  and recognition of impairment loss on the following  financial assets and credit risk exposure:     a)   F inancial assets that are debt instruments, and  are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans,  debtsecurities, deposits, trade receivables  and bank balance     b)   F inancial assets that are debt instruments and  are measured as at FVTOCI     c)   L ease receivables under Ind AS 116 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 480 481 Coal India Limited Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)     d)   T rade receivables or any contractual right to  receive cash or another financial asset that  result from transactions that are within the  scope of Ind AS 115.     T he Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on: 	  Trade receivables or contract revenue  receivables; and 	  All lease receivables resulting from transactions  within the scope of Ind AS 116     T he application of simplified approach does not  require the Group to track changes in credit risk.  Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance  based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right  from its initial recognition. 2.15.2 Financial liabilities 2.15.2.1 Initial recognition and measurement     T he Group’s financial liabilities include trade and  other payables, loans and borrowings including  bank overdrafts.     All financial liabilities ar e recognised initially at fair  value and, in the case of loans and borrowings  and payables, net of directly attributable  transaction costs. 2.15.2.2 Subsequent measurement     T he measurement of financial liabilities depends on  their classification, as described below: 2.15.2.2.1 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss     F inancial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss include financial liabilities held for trading and  financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition  as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities  are classified as held for trading if they are incurred  for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This  category also includes derivative financial instruments  entered into by the Group that are not designated as  hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined  by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives  are also classified as held for trading unless they are  designated as effective hedging instruments.     Gains or losses on liabilities held for tr ading are  recognised in the profit or loss. 2.15.2.2.2   F inancial liabilities at amortised cost     Af ter initial recognition, these are subsequently  measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest rate method. Gains and losses are  recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities  are derecognised as well as through the effective  interest rate amortisation process. Amortised cost  is calculated by taking into account any discount or  premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are  an integral part of the effective interest rate. The  effective interest rate amortisation is included as  finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. 2.15.2.3   Derecognition     A  financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged or  cancelled or expires. When an existing financial  liability is replaced by another from the same  lender on substantially different terms, or the terms  of an existing liability are substantially modified,  such an exchange or modification is treated as  the derecognition of the original liability and the  recognition of a new liability. The difference between  the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of  a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to  another party and the consideration paid, including  any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities  assumed, shall be recognised in profit or loss. 2.15.2.4   R eclassification of financial assets     T he Group determines classification of financial  assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After  initial recognition, no reclassification is made for  financial assets which are equity instruments and  financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt  instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is  a change in the business model for managing those  assets. Changes to the business model are expected  to be infrequent. The Group’s senior management  determines change in the business model as a result  of external or internal changes which are significant  to the Group’s operations. Such changes are  evident to external parties. A change in the business  model occurs when the Group either begins or  ceases to perform an activity that is significant to  its operations. If Group reclassifies financial assets,  it applies the reclassification prospectively from  the reclassification date which is the first day of  the immediately next reporting period following  the change in business model. The Group does  not restate any previously recognised gains, losses  (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.     T he following table shows various reclassification and how they are accounted for Original classification Revised  classification Accounting treatment Amortised cost FVTPL Fair value is measured at reclassification date. Difference between  previous amortized cost and fair value is recognised in P&L. FVTPL Amortised Cost Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new gross carrying  amount. EIR is calculated based on the new gross carrying amount. Amortised cost FVTOCI Fair value is measured at reclassification date. Difference between  previous amortised cost and fair value is recognised in OCI. No  change in EIR due to reclassification. FVTOCI Amortised cost Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new amortised cost  carrying amount. However, cumulative gain or loss in OCI is adjusted  against fair value. Consequently, the asset is measured as if it had  always been measured at amortised cost. FVTPL FVTOCI Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new carrying amount.  No other adjustment is required. FVTOCI FVTPL Assets continue to be measured at fair value. Cumulative gain  or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified to P&L at the  reclassification date.     F inancial assets and financial liabilities are offset  and the net amount is reported in the consolidated  balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal  right to offset the recognised amounts and there is  an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the  assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 2.15.2.6 Fair value measurement of financial instruments     F air value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date under current market conditions.     T he Group categorizes assets and liabilities  measured at fair value into one of three levels  depending on the ability to observe inputs  employed for such measurement:    (a)   L evel 1:  inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)  in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    (b)   L evel 2:  inputs other than quoted prices  included within level 1 that are observable either  directly or indirectly for the asset or liability.    (c)   L evel 3:  inputs for the asset or liability which  are not based on observable market data  (unobservable inputs).     T he Group has an established control framework  with respect to the measurement of fair values.  This includes a finance team that has overall  responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value  measurements who regularly review significant  unobservable inputs, valuation adjustments and  fair value hierarchy under which the valuation  should be classified. 2.15.3 Cash and Cash equivalents    C  ash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise  cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with  an original maturity of three months or less, which are  subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For  the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows,  cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term  deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank  overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the  Group’s cash management. 2.16. Borrowing Costs   Borr owing costs are expensed as and when incurred  except where they are directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of qualifying  assets i.e. the assets that necessarily takes substantial  period of time to get ready for its intended use, in which  case they are capitalised as part of the cost of related  asset up to the date when the qualifying asset is ready for  its intended use. 2.17 Taxation   Income tax e xpense represents the sum of the tax payable  for the year and deferred tax.   Curr ent tax is the amount of income taxes payable  (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for  a period. Taxable profit differs from “profit before income  tax” as reported in the statement of profit and loss and  other comprehensive income because it excludes items  of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in  other years and it further excludes items that are never  taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax  is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)   Deferr ed tax liabilities are generally recognised for  all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets  are generally recognised for all deductible temporary  difference to the extent that it is probable that taxable  profits will be available against which those deductible  temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and  liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference  arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other  than in a business combination) of other assets and  liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable  profit nor the accounting profit.   Deferr ed tax liabilities are recognised for taxable  temporary differences associated with investments in  subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is  able to control the reversal of the temporary difference  and it is probable that the temporary difference will not  reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets  arising from deductible temporary differences associated  with such investments and interests are only recognised  to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient  taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the  temporary differences.   T he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed  at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable  profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset  to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are  reassessed at the end of each reporting year and are  recognised to the extent that it has become probable that  sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part  of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.   Deferr ed tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax  rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the  liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rate  (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the end of the reporting period.   T he measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets  reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the  manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the  reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount  of its assets and liabilities.   Curr ent and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in which case, the current and deferred tax are also  recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred  tax arises from the initial accounting for a business  combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting  for the business combination.   Deferr ed income tax assets and liabilities are offset  when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current  tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the  deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income  taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the  taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is  an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 2.18 Employee Benefits 2.18.1 Short-term Benefits   Shor t-term employee benefits are employee benefits  (other than termination benefits) that are expected to be  settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the  annual reporting period in which the employees render  the related service.   All shor t-term employee benefits are recognized in the  period in which the services are rendered by employees. 2.18.2    P ost-employment benefits and other long term  employee benefits 2.18.2.1 Defined contributions plans     A  defined contribution plan is a post-employment  benefit plan under which the Group pays a fixed  contribution into a fund maintained by a separate  body and the Group will have no legal or constructive  obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for  contributions to defined contribution plans are  recognised as an employee benefit expense in the  statement of profit and loss in the periods during  which services are rendered by employees. 2.18.2.2 Defined benefits plans     A  defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit  plan other than a defined contribution plan. The  Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit  plans is calculated by estimating the amount of  future benefit that employees have earned in return  of their service in the current and prior periods.  The benefit is discounted to determine its present  value and reduced by the fair value of plan assets,  if any. The discount rate is based on the prevailing  market yields of Indian Government securities  as at the reporting date that have maturity dates  approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations  and that are denominated in the same currency in  which the benefits are expected to be paid.     T he application of actuarial valuation involves  making assumptions about the discount rate,  expected rates of return on assets, future salary  increases, mortality rates etc. Due to the long-term  nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to  uncertainties. The calculation is performed at each  balance sheet by an actuary using the projected  unit credit method. When the calculation results  in the benefit to the Group, the recognised asset  is limited to the present value of the economic  benefits available in the form of any future refunds  from the plan or reduction in future contributions  to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the  Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or  on settlement of plan liabilities.     R e-measurement of the net defined benefit  liability, which comprises actuarial gain and losses  considering the return on plan assets (excluding  interest) and the effects of the assets ceiling (if any,  excluding interest) are recognised immediately  in the other comprehensive income. The Group  determines the net interest expense (income) on  the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period  by applying the discount rate used to measure  the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of  the annual period to the then net defined benefit  liability (asset), taking into account any changes  in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during  the period as a result of contributions and benefit  payments. Net interest expense and other expenses  related to defined benefit plans are recognised in  profit and loss.     When the benefits of  the plan are improved, the  portion of the increased benefit relating to past  service by employees is recognised as an expense  immediately in the statement of profit and loss. 2.18.3 Other long-term employee benefits   Other long-term employee benefits ar e all employee  benefits other than short-term employee benefits, post- employment benefits and termination benefits.   Other long-term employee  benefits include items which  are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve  months after the end of the annual reporting period in  which the employees render the related service.   F or other long-term employee benefits, net total of the  following amounts is recognized in the statement of  profit or loss:   (a)   Service cost   (b)   Net  interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset)   (c)   R e-measurements of the net defined benefit  liability (asset) 2.19 Foreign Currency   T ransactions in foreign currencies are converted into the  reported currency of the Group using the exchange rate  prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and  liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding  at the end of the reporting period are translated at the  exchange rates prevailing as at the end of reporting  period. Exchange differences arising on the settlement  of monetary assets and liabilities or on translating  monetary assets and liabilities at rates different from  those at which they were translated on initial recognition  during the period or in previous financial statements are  recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in  which they arise.   Non-monetary items denomina ted in foreign currency  are valued at the exchange rates prevailing on the date  of transactions. 2.20 Stripping Activity   In  case of opencast mining, the mine waste materials  (“overburden”) which consists of soil and rock on the top  of coal seam is required to be removed to get access  to the coal and its extraction. The process of removing  overburden to access coal is referred to as stripping.  Stripping is necessary to obtain access to coal and  occurs throughout the life of an opencast mine. Stripping  costs during development and production phases are  classified in property, plant, and equipment. Stripping  costs are accounted for separately for individual mines.   T he Group accounts for stripping activities as follows:   S tripping costs during the Development phase   T hese are initial overburden removal costs incurred to  obtain access to coal to be extracted. These costs are  capitalised when it is probable that future economic  benefits will flow to the Group and costs can be  measured reliably. Once the production phase begins,  capitalised development stripping costs are amortised  over the mine life.   S tripping costs during the production phase:   T hese are overburden removal costs incurred after the mine  has been brought to revenue as per the policy of the group.  Stripping costs during the production phase can give rise to  two benefits, the extraction of coal in the current period and  improved access to coal which will be extracted in future  periods. Stripping costs during the production phase are  allocated between the inventory produced and the stripping  activity asset using a standard strip ratio (overburden- to-coal). The standard strip ratio is the total volume of  overburden expected to be removed over the life of the  mine against the total coal to be extracted over the life of  the mine. When the actual volume of overburden removed  is greater than the expected volume of overburden removal,  the stripping cost for excess overburden removed over the  expected overburden removal is capitalised to the stripping  activity asset being improved access to the coal and  disclosed as stripping activity adjustments in the statement  of profit and loss. The stripping activity asset is amortised  over the expected useful life of the mine. Changes in geo- mining conditions may have an impact on the standard strip  ratio. Changes to the ratio are accounted for prospectively.  Stripping activity asset are shown separately under Property,  plant, and equipment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)   S tripping activity asset for stripping costs during the  production phase are recognised in the mines with a rated  capacity of one million tonnes per annum and above. 2.21 Inventories 2.21.1 Stock of Coal   Inventories of  coal/coke are stated at lower of cost and  net realisable value. The cost of inventories are calculated  using the Weighted Average method. Net realisable value  represents the estimated selling price of inventories less  all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary  to make the sale.   Book stock of  coal is considered in the accounts where  the variance between book stock and measured stock is  up to +/- 5% and in cases where the variance is beyond  +/- 5% the measured stock is considered. Such stocks are  valued at net realisable value or cost whichever is lower.  Coke is considered as a part of the stock of coal.    C  oal & coke-fines are valued at lower of cost or  net realisable value and considered as a part of  the stock of coal.   Slurry (coking/semi-coking),  middling of washeries,  and by products are valued at net realisable value and  considered as a part of the stock of coal. 2.21.2 Stores, Spares, and Other Inventories   T he Stock of stores and spares including other inventories  are valued at cost calculated on the basis of the weighted  average method.   P rovisions are made at the rate of 100% for unserviceable,  damaged and obsolete stores and spares and at the rate  of 50% for stores & spares not moved for 5 years. 2.22    P rovisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets   P rovisions are recognized when the Group has a present  obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,  and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits  will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable  estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.  Where the time value of money is material, provisions are  stated at the present value of the expenditure expected  to settle the obligation.   All pr ovisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date  and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.   Wher e it is not probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be  estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a  contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of  economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose  existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or  non-occurrence of one or more future uncertain events  not wholly within the control of the Group, are also  disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability  of outflow of economic benefits is remote.    C  ontingent assets are possible assets that arise from past  events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain  future events not wholly within the control of the  Group. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial  statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable  on the basis of the judgment of management. These are  assessed continually to ensure that developments are  appropriately reflected in the financial statements. 2.23 Earnings per share   Basic e arnings per share are computed by dividing the  net profit after tax by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted  earnings per shares is computed by dividing the profit  after tax by the weighted average number of equity  shares considered for deriving basic earnings per shares  and also the weighted average number of equity shares  that could have been issued upon conversion of all  dilutive potential equity shares. 2.24 Stripping activity provision (Ratio Variance)   S tripping activity provision was recognized or reversed  based on the current ratio of Overburden to Coal as  compared to the average Stripping ratio (Standard ratio)  of the mine as per the policy followed in earlier years  since inception consistently by CIL. This accounting  method being substantiated and validated by a multitude  of authoritative bodies and forums, including income tax  authorities, the provision created in earlier years have  been continued.   T he amount of the provision so carried forward is reversed  periodically in systematic manner on extraction of actual  volume of overburden being in excess of the expected  volume in terms of the mine specific plan as approved on  mine to mine basis and disclosed as reversal of stripping  activity provision under other operating revenue. Such  reversal is specific to the mines at the rate the said  provision was originally recognised. 2.25 Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions   T he preparation of the financial statements in conformity  with Ind AS requires management to make estimates,  judgments, and assumptions that affect the application  of accounting policies and the reported amounts of  assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets  and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the  amount of revenue and expenses during the reported  period. Application of accounting policies involving  complex and subjective judgements and the use of  assumptions in these financial statements have been  disclosed. Accounting estimates could change from  period to period. Actual results could differ from those  estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognised in the period in which the  estimates are revised and, if material, their effects are  disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 2.25.1 Judgements   In the pr ocess of applying the Group’s accounting  policies, management has made the following judgments,  which have the most significant effect on the amounts  recognised in the financial statements: 2.25.1.1 Formulation of Accounting Policies     Accounting policies ar e formulated in a manner that  results in financial statements containing relevant  and reliable information about the transactions,  other events and conditions to which they apply.  Those policies need not be applied when the effect  of applying them is immaterial.     In  the absence of an Ind AS that specifically  applies to a transaction, other event or condition,  management has used its judgment in developing  and applying an accounting policy that results in  information that is:     a)   r elevant to the economic decision-making  needs of users and     b)   r eliable in that financial statements: and       (i)   r epresent faithfully the financial position,  financial performance and cash flows  of the Group; (ii) reflect the economic  substance of transactions, other events  and conditions, and not merely the legal  form; (iii) are neutral, i.e. free from bias;  (iv) are prudent; and (v) are complete in  all material respects on a consistent basis     In making  the judgment management refers to, and  considers the applicability of, the following sources  in descending order:     (a)   the r equirements in Ind ASs dealing with similar  and related issues; and     (b)   the definitions,  recognition criteria and  measurement concepts for assets, liabilities,  income, and expenses in the Framework.     In making the judgment,  management considers the  most recent pronouncements of the International  Accounting Standards Board and in the absence  thereof those of the other standard-setting bodies  that use a similar conceptual framework to develop  accounting standards, other accounting literature,  and accepted industry practices, to the extent that  these do not conflict with the Indian accounting  Standard and accounting policies and practices as  stated in above paragraph.     T he Group operates in the mining sector (a sector  where the exploration, evaluation, and development  production phases are based on the varied  topographical and geo-mining terrain spread over  the lease period running over decades and prone to  constant changes), the accounting policies whereof  have evolved based on specific industry practices  supported by research committees and approved  by the various regulators owing to its consistent  application over the last several decades. In the  absence of specific accounting literature, guidance  and standards in certain specific areas which are  in the process of evolution, the Group continues  to strive to develop accounting policies in line  with the development of accounting literature and  any development therein shall be accounted for  prospectively as per the procedure laid down above  more, particularly in Ind AS 8. 2.25.1.2 Materiality     Ind  AS applies to items which are material.  Management uses judgement in deciding whether  individual items or groups of item are material in  the financial statements. Materiality is judged by  reference to the nature or magnitude or both of  the items. The deciding factor is whether omitting  or misstating or obscuring an information could  individually or in combination with other information  influence decisions that primary users make on the  basis of the financial statements. Management also  uses judgement of materiality for determining the  compliance requirement of the Ind AS. Further, the  Group may also be required to present separately  immaterial items when required by law.     With ef fect from 01.04.2019 Errors/omissions  discovered during the year relating to prior periods  are treated as immaterial and adjusted during the  year, if all such errors and omissions in aggregate  does not exceed 1% of total revenue from Operation  (net of statutory levies) as per the last audited  financial statement of the Group. 2.25.1.3 Operating lease     Gr oup has entered into lease agreements. The  Group has determined, based on an evaluation of  the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such  as the lease term not constituting a major part of the  economic life of the commercial property and the  fair value of the asset, that it retains all the significant  risks and rewards of ownership of these properties  and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) 2.25.2 Estimates and assumptions     T he key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  year, are described below. The Group based its  assumptions and estimates on parameters available  when the consolidated financial statements were  prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions  about future developments, however, may change  due to market changes or circumstances arising that  are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes  are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.     T he estimates, judgements and associated  assumptions are based on historical experience  and other factors that are considered to be relevant.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.     Estima tes and underlying assumptions are reviewed  on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognised in the period in which the  estimate is revised and future periods affected.     T he application of accounting policies that require  critical judgements and accounting estimates  involving complex and subjective judgements and  the use of assumptions in these standalone financial  statements have been disclosed here in below: 2.25.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets     T here is an indication of impairment if, the carrying  value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds  its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair  value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Group  considers individual mines as separate cash generating  units for the purpose of test of impairment. The value  in use calculation is based on a DCF model. The cash  flows are derived from the budget for the next five  years and do not include restructuring activities that  the Group is not yet committed to or significant future  investments that will enhance the asset’s performance  of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) being tested. The  recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate  used for the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model as  well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth  rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates  are most relevant to other mining infrastructures. The  key assumptions used to determine the recoverable  amount for the different CGUs, are disclosed and  further explained in respective notes. 2.25.2.2 Income Taxes     Deferr ed tax assets are recognised for unused tax  losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable  profit will be available against which the losses can  be utilised. Significant management judgement  is required to determine the amount of deferred  tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the  likely timing and the level of future taxable profits  together with future tax planning strategies. 2.25.2.3    Defined  benefit plans and long term employee  benefits     T he cost of the defined benefit plan and other post- employment medical benefits and the present value  of the obligations are determined using actuarial  valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making  various assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include the  determination of the discount rate, future salary  increases and mortality rates.     Due to the comple xities involved in the valuation and  its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is  highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All  assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.  The parameter most subject to change is the discount  rate. In determining the appropriate discount  rate for plans operated in India, the management  considers the interest rates of government bonds  in currencies consistent with the currencies of the  post-employment benefit obligation.     T he mortality rate is based on publicly available  mortality tables of the country. Those mortality  tables tend to change only at interval in response to  demographic changes. 2.25.2.4 Intangible asset under development     T he Group capitalises intangible asset under  development for a project in accordance with  the accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of  costs is based on management’s judgement  that technological and economic feasibility  is confirmed, usually when a project report is  formulated and approved. 2.25.2.5    P rovision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and  Decommissioning Obligation     In determining the fair value of  the provision for Mine  Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning  Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made  in relation to discount rates, the expected cost  of site restoration and dismantling and the expected timing of those costs. The Group estimates provision using the  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method considering life of the project/mine based on 	  Estimated cost per hectare as specified in guidelines issued by Ministry of Coal, 	  Government of India 	  The discount rate (pre-tax rate) that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the liability. 2.26 Abbreviation used: a.

Stripping  activity provision (net) was recognized or reversed  based on the current ratio of OB to Coal as compared  to the average Stripping ratio (Standard ratio) of the  mine. This accounting method has been substantiated  and validated by a multitude of authoritative bodies and  forums, including income tax authorities.   T he carrying amount of the stripping activity provision is  reversed systematically whenever the situation of reversal  arises on extraction of actual volume of overburden over  expected volume thereof. Such reversal is specific to  mines at the rate the said provision has been recognized.   In the case of  a mine, where the stripping activity provision  has resulted in an excess volume of overburden over the  volume of overburden expected, the corresponding  provision as determined with respect to, multiplied by the  opening average rate of stripping activity being no longer  required has been recognised as reversal of stripping  activity provision under other operating revenue in the  statement of profit and loss.   Amount  of stripping activity provision representing  the credit balance of the stripping activity created till  31.03.2022 is reversed and credited to the profit and loss  accounts in systematic manner. Accordingly  H  7445.29  crore (including  H  2881.75 crore for the year ended 31st  March, 2025) ( H  2438.44 crore for the year ended 31st  March, 2024) has been written back from the provision,  leaving a balance of  H  58468.52 crore as on 31st March,  2025 to be so adjusted over the years as per the policy  followed in this respect (refer note 2.24).   T he Group has adopted a systematic reversal policy for  Stripping Activity Provisions, leaving the requirements  of IND AS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets”. This approach, however, is consistent  with IND AS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”,  considering the nature of the Group’s business and  the objective of financial statements as set out in terms  of the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting  under Indian Accounting Standards. Accordingly, a  provision of  H  58,468.52 crore (P.Y.:  H  61,350.26 crore) is  presented under Non-current Provisions as ""Stripping  Activity Provision"" instead of under Other Equity in  the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Consequently, the  systematic reversal of this provision with consequent  impact on net profit is recognised under Other Operating  Revenue at  H  2881.75 crore for the year (P.Y.:  H  2438.44  crore) (refer note 12.1.4).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTE - 9.1 : PROVISIONS (Contd..) 9.1.3  Provision for Site Restoration/Mine Closure   T he Group's obligation for land reclamation and  decommissioning of structures consists of spending at  both surface and underground mines in accordance  with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of  India. The estimate of obligation for Mine Closure, Site  Restoration and Decommissioning based upon detailed  calculation and technical assessment of the amount  and timing of the future cash spending to perform the  required work. Mine Closure expenditure is provided  as per approved Mine Closure Plan. The estimates of  expenses are escalated for inflation, and then discounted  at a discount rate (@8%) that reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks, so  that the amount of provision reflects the present value of  the expenditures expected to be required to settle the  obligation. The value of the provision is progressively  increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds;  creating an expense recognised as financial expenses.  In reference to above guidelines for preparation of  mine closure plan, an escrow account has been opened.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED) NOTE – 16: ADDITIONAL NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATEDE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR  ENDED 31-03-2025 (Contd..)     A  brief of each level is given below:    Level 1:  Level 1 hierarchy includes financial  instruments me asured using quoted prices.    Level 2:  The fair value of financial instruments that  are not traded in an active market is determined  using valuation techniques which maximize the  use of observable market data and rely as little as  possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant  inputs required to fair value an instrument are  observable, the instrument is included in level 2. This  includes Mutual fund which is valued using closing  Net Asset Value (NAV) as at the reporting date.    Level 3:  If one or more of the significant inputs  is not based on observable market data, the  instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for  investments , security deposits and other liabilities  included in level 3.   (c)   V aluation technique used in determining fair value     V aluation techniques used to value financial  instruments include the use of quoted market  prices (NAV) of instruments in respect of investment  in Mutual Funds.   (d)   F air value measurements using significant  unobservable inputs     At pr esent there are no fair value measurements  using significant unobservable inputs.   (e)   F air values of financial assets and liabilities  measured at amortised cost     T he carrying amounts of trade receivables, short  term deposits, cash and cash equivalents, trade  payables are considered to be the same as their fair  values, due to their short-term nature.     T he Group  considers  that the Security Deposits  does not include a significant financing component.  Security deposits coincide with the company’s  performance and the contract requires amounts to  be retained for reasons other than the provision of  finance. The withholding of a specified percentage  of each milestone payment is intended to protect  the interest of the group, from the contractor  failing to adequately complete its obligations  under the contract. Accordingly,  transaction  cost  of Security deposit is considered as fair value at  initial recognition  and subsequently measured at  amortised cost.    Significant estimates:  The fair value of financial  instruments that are not traded in an active market  is determined using valuation techniques. The  Group uses its judgment to select a method and  makes suitable assumptions at the end of each  reporting period. 5   F inancial Risk Management   F inancial risk management objectives and policies   T he Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise  trade and other payables. The main purpose of these  financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations  and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The  Group’s principal financial assets include loans, trade and  other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents that is  derived directly from its operations.   T he Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and  liquidity risk. The Group’s senior management oversees  the management of these risks. The Group’s senior  management is supported by a risk committee that  advises, inter alia, on financial risks and the appropriate  financial risk governance framework for the Group. The risk  committee provides assurance to the Board of Directors  that the Group’s financial risk activities are governed by  appropriate policies and procedures and that financial  risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance  with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. The Board of  Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each  of these risks, which are summarised below.   T his note explains the sources of risk which the entity is exposed to and how the entity manages the risk and  the impact of hedge accounting in the financial statements. Risk Exposure arising from Measurement Management Credit Risk Trade receivables and  financial assets Ageing analysis/ Credit  rating Department of public enterprises  (DPE guidelines), diversification  of bank deposits credit limits and  other securities; Counterparty  default risk of trade receivables is  managed by financial assurances  like Security Deposits, Advances,  Bank Guarantee etc. Risk Exposure arising from Measurement Management Liquidity Risk Borrowings and other  liabilities Periodic cash flows Availability of committed credit  lines and borrowing facilities Market Risk-foreign exchange Future commercial  transactions, recognised  financial assets and liabilities  not denominated in INR Cash flow forecast  sensitivity analysis Regular watch and review by  senior management and audit  committee.

NOTE – 16: ADDITIONAL NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR  ENDED 31-03-2025 (Contd..)   T he Group risk management is carried out by the board of directors as per DPE guidelines issued by Government of India.  The board provides written principles for overall risk management as well as policies covering investment of excess liquidity.   Cr edit risk management:   R eceivables arise mainly out of sale of Coal. Sale of  Coal is broadly categorized as sale through fuel supply  agreements (FSAs) and e-auction. Macro - economic  information (such as regulatory changes) is incorporated  as part of the fuel supply agreements (FSAs) and  e-auction terms.   F uel Supply Agreements (FSAs)   T he group enters into legally enforceable FSAs with  customers or with State Nominated Agencies that in turn  enters into appropriate distribution arrangements with  end customers. FSAs can be broadly categorized into: 	  FSAs with customers in the power utilities sector,  including State power utilities, private power utilities  (“PPUs”) and independent power producers (“IPPs”)  under various clauses of Scheme to Harness and  Allocate Koyla (Coal) Transparently in India (SHAKTI); 	  FSAs with customers in non-power industries  (including captive power plants (“CPPs”)) as per  Non-Regulated Sector (NRS) Linkage Policy; and 	  FSAs with State Nominated Agencies.   E-Auction Scheme   T he E-Auction scheme of coal has been introduced to  provide access to coal for customers who were not able  to source their coal requirement through the available  institutional mechanisms under the NCDP for various  reasons, for example, due to a less than full allocation of  their normative requirement under NCDP, seasonality of  their coal requirement and limited requirement of coal  that does not warrant a long-term linkage. The quantity of  coal to be offered under E-Auction is reviewed from time  to time by the Ministry of Coal.   Cr edit risk arises when a counterparty defaults on  contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the  group. Counterparty defaults risk of trade receivables is  managed by financial assurances like Security Deposits,  Advances, Bank Guarantee etc.   P rovision for expected credit loss: The Group provides  for expected credit risk loss for doubtful/ credit impaired  assets, by lifetime expected credit losses (Simplified  approach). Refer Note - 4.3, Trade Receivables   Significant estima tes and judgments for Impairment of  financial assets   T he impairment provisions for financial assets disclosed  above are based on assumptions about risk of default  and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgment in  making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to  the impairment calculation, based on the Group’s past  history, existing market conditions as well as forward  looking estimates at the end of each reporting year.   Liquidity Risk   P rudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining  sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability  of funding through an adequate amount of committed  credit facilities to meet obligations when due. Due to  the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group  treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining  availability under committed credit lines. Refer Note 16 (1)  (II) Guarantee for the bank borrowings within consortium  of banks and outside consortium, the fund and non fund  based limit for working capital credit etc.   Management monitors for ecasts of the group's liquidity  position (comprising the undrawn borrowing facilities)  and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected  cash flows. This is generally carried out at local level in  accordance with practice and limits set by the group.
