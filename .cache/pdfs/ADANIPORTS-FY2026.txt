The stage is all set for  the race towards becoming a global  manufacturing and trade powerhouse.  The Big Challenge   Traditional supply chain models are  fragmented, inefficient and costly.  They present bottlenecks that can  hinder progress. For years, Adani Ports and Special  Economic Zone Limited (APSEZ) has  envisioned creating maritime and  logistics infrastructure that is smarter,  faster and more agile. Today, that vision  is a reality. With our bold reinvention as  one of India’s largest and most advanced  Integrated Transport Utilities, we are  taking charge of transforming India's  supply chain dynamics. What We Bring?  An extensive portfolio of ports across  India’s coastline and key global  destinations, serving as vital gateways  for global trade and economic growth. A diverse set of marine assets – tugs,  offshore support vessels, dredgers  – that deliver an extensive range of  marine   services.  A multimodal logistics ecosystem  comprising trains, trucks, multi-modal  logistic parks (MMLPs), warehousing and  freight forwarding services that facilitate  efficient inland goods movement.  SEZ land banks that power industrial  development.  Together, interconnected by advanced  digital platforms, they create one of the  largest end-to-end ecosystems that ensure  seamless, high-performance and cost- effective transport solutions.  They catalyse India’s ability to  manufacture competitively, move around  goods efficiently and export profitably. As  India advances to become a USD 5 trillion  economy, our future-ready platform will  be key to empowering businesses and  enhancing India’s competitiveness. Strength with  Resilience It is not just about our scale or the differentiation we bring in  and how we leverage them to deliver resilient performance. It  is about our commitment to lead and create a larger impact  on our stakeholders, society and the nation. This is what it means to have  20 21 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED

MESSAGE FROM    THE CHAIRMAN Our objectives are aligned with India’s ambitions.  And   our strength comes from the belief that you –  our   shareholders – place in us. Dear Stakeholders, Let me begin with a salute and a bow of gratitude as a  fellow citizen who deeply acknowledges the courage of  our brothers and sisters that guard our peace. During Operation Sindoor, our brave men and women  in uniform stood tall, not for recognition, but for duty.  Times like these make us realise that peace cannot  be taken for granted. It is earned through decades of  silent sacrifice, unwavering resolve and strength built  far from the spotlight, in the deserts, on the borders  and deep at sea. Our achievements as a nation do not just lie in balance  sheets or boardrooms but also belong to the soldiers  who stand watch while we build, and to the uniform  that chooses service while we chase ambition. It is with this humbling sense of purpose that I write  to you today. In 2024-25, the Adani Group delivered  yet another year of significant growth. Growth built  on the bedrock of your unwavering trust, and a belief  in the long arc of transformation. And we have not  grown in calm seas. We have grown in the middle of  global turbulence. Over 60 nations have gone to the polls, redrawing  maps, rewriting alliances. Conflicts in the Middle  East have disrupted energy flows and logistics  corridors. Europe, once an economic stronghold, now  grapples with stagnation and a search for identity in a  fractured world. In the midst of all this, our country stood apart. While prudence elsewhere buckled under pressure,  India surged forward as a beacon of stability, of  growth amidst uncertainty and of confidence  amidst confusion. Yes, we have the wind at our back, a demographic  dividend, a booming digital economy and infrastructure  built at record pace. But make no mistake, this  momentum did not happen by chance. It is the result of vision. Of intent. Of policy with  purpose. I say this with full conviction that the Indian  Government, both at the Centre and across the states,  has laid down the foundation for a truly historic  transformation. A transformation not of a few, but for an  entire nation rising with ambition that declares - India’s  best chapters are just beginning. And together, we are  not just witnessing history. We are helping shape it. As a youngster, I saw my mother as my guiding star.  I recall her often saying: "ભાારતીીય સાામ્રાાજ્યોોનુંં� ભાાગ્ય  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં�  નું  હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ ક્યાા ર ેય  પ તીનું   પ ામ્ ય ા  નુંહી � , પણ  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં� હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ દ ર ેક પ તીનું  પછીી વધુ ં   શક્તિ� શ ાળીી અ નું ે અખં � ડ  સા� કલ્પ સાાથેે ફ ર ી ઊભાા રહ્યાં ા �."  Translated, it meant, "The future of India's empires was  not written by those who never accepted defeat, but by  those brave hearts who turned every fall into a stepping  stone - and each time rose again with stronger resolve  to change history." She would often tell me: “Gautam, history does not remember sailors who sailed  in calm waters; it remembers those who braved the  wildest storms and still returned home." And my dear shareholders, that is exactly what we  have done. Even in the face of fierce headwinds and relentless  scrutiny – we have never retreated. Instead – we have  recalibrated. We have reimagined. And we have become  – more formidable, more unbreakable, more stronger  and more resilient! People often ask me: “How does the Adani Group keep  doing it? How do we rise, time and again?” My answer remains the same: Our conviction is  anchored in clarity. Our objectives are aligned with  India’s ambitions. And our strength comes from the  belief that you – our shareholders – place in us. And all of this was tested last year, when we faced  allegations from the US Department of Justice and the  SEC relating to Adani Green Energy. Let me be clear: this was not the first time we have been  tested. Nor will it be the last. Every challenge sharpens  our resolve. Every setback becomes a stepping stone. Despite all the noise, the facts are that – no one from  the Adani Group has been charged with violating the  FCPA or conspiring to obstruct justice. We live in a  We have become –    more formidable,  more unbreakable,  more stronger and  more resilient! - GAUTAM ADANI 28 29 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED 

world where negativity often echoes louder than truth.  But as we cooperate with legal processes, let me also  restate - emphatically - our governance is of global  standards, and our compliance frameworks are robust  and non-negotiable. And while the numbers tell their own compelling story  – in a year of record-breaking revenue, unprecedented  growth and historic profitability – the deeper truth is  that these milestones are reflections of our relentless  strength and tenacity. They are proof of a Group that  dares to dream beyond constraints, powered by a nation  that breathes possibility into every tomorrow ahead  of us. Let me now talk about a few of the highlights of  FY   2024-25. Across all our sectors, we did more than  just scale – we created impact, inspired change, and  most importantly, deepened our national commitment. Adani Power crossed 100 billion units of power  generation, added 2.3 GW of conventional capacity,  funded  `   12,000+ crore in capex mainly through internal  accruals, and secured a 1,500 MW PPA in Maharashtra.  It is now well on track to reach 31 GW capacity by 2030. Adani Green reached an operational renewable energy  capacity of over 14 GW and is on target to build the  world’s largest renewable energy plant of 30 GW at  Khavda and a total of 50 GW of renewables capacity  by 2030. Also, with over 5,000 MW of pumped  hydro storage targeted to be installed by 2030 and a  40-year 1,250 MW energy storage PPA with UPPCL,  we are setting global benchmarks in the space of  energy transition. Adani Energy Solutions had a huge year. It secured  `   43,990 crore in transmission orders and executed  `   13,600 crore worth of smart metering projects.  It retained its no. 1 DISCOM rank in India and became  the only private player with three national HVDC grid  links in its portfolio. Adani New Industries is aligned with the nation's  sustainability goals and has an order book for  construction of a 300 MW electrolyser plant. It also  launched an electrolyser testing lab at Mundra. It is  on track to expand its solar module manufacturing  lines and will have a 10 GW integrated solar  module manufacturing facility in place by the next  financial year. Adani Ports continued to strengthen its value  proposition as an Integrated Transport Utility with  unparalleled waterfront to customer gate capabilities.  Adani Ports handled an all-time high cargo volume of  450 MMT and achieved a 27% market share in India.  Atmanirbharta. This is the future we are grateful to have  an opportunity to help build. And the same applies to building Data Centers that  India needs to stay competitive in the technology  space. With the surge in AI, AdaniConneX is scaling fast.  We have projects exceeding 210 MW in various stages of  construction in partnership with the global hyperscalers  and have launched a giga-scale renewable-powered data  center campus in Navi Mumbai. Continuing the path of sustainability, Adani Total  Gas is playing a defining role in India’s clean energy  transition. As of this year, we serve close to 1 million PNG  customers and operate 647 CNG stations. Our roadmap  is to double both by 2030. Our e-mobility footprint  now spans 22 states and 4 union territories, with over  3,400 EV charging points installed, thereby positioning  us at the forefront of India’s evolving sustainable  energy ecosystem. But perhaps our most transformative project is unfolding  in Dharavi - Asia’s largest slum, now being reimagined  as India’s most ambitious urban rehabilitation project.  Over 1 million people will move from narrow lanes to  sunlit, modern homes. Inspired by Singapore’s housing  model and co-designed with global experts, the township  will feature spacious layouts, dual toilets, open spaces,  schools, hospitals, transit hubs and parks. Our Dharavi Social Mission is uplifting youth through  skilling, healthcare and employment programmes. A new  multi-modal mobility hub, amphitheatre, cloud kitchens  and riverfront are being planned to serve all of Mumbai. In terms of consolidated numbers, at the Group level,  revenues grew by 7%, EBITDA by 8.2%, and our Net  Debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained healthy at 2.6x. But, as I have stated in the past, our objective is  not to just build businesses - it is to create new  possibilities. Not just to serve markets - but to serve  our nation’s destiny. And in this context, our capital  investment across businesses is set to break all  records. We anticipate an annual CAPEX spend of  USD 15-20 billion for the next 5 years. These are  not just investments in our Group, but investments  in the possibilities for doing our part to build  India’s infrastructure. Before I start wrapping up, let me outline some of the  programmes that have me the most excited about. Exactly three years ago, on my 60 th  birthday, my  family pledged  `   60,000 crore to redefine healthcare,  education, and skill development in India. The Adani  Healthcare Temples are our first major step – world-class,  Adani Ports also continued to strengthen its logistics  network within the Indian hinterland across its diverse  range of assets including rakes, multi-modal logistics  parks, warehouses, agri silos and trucks, in addition  to starting freight forwarding services and a trucking  management platform. Adani Ports' marine division  also completed the successful acquisition of Astro  Offshore during the year and is set to deliver 3x growth  by FY   2026-27. Adani Natural Resources too had a very strong  year contributing to India's energy independence.  It produced a record 47 million tonnes of coal and  iron ore and is on track to achieve over 30% growth  by FY 2025-26. We also pioneered India’s first  hydrogen-powered mining truck as well as launched  an e-commerce platform that will soon enable  online trading of LPG, rock phosphate, copper and  precious metals. Also, in line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, Kutch  Copper has successfully produced its first copper anode  at Mundra thereby marking a strategic move in India’s  capability to meet the surging demand for energy  transition materials. Two and a half years ago, when we acquired  Holcim’s India cement business, we had made a bold  commitment: to double our capacity to 140 MTPA by  FY 2027-28. Today, I am proud to share that we have  already achieved 72% of that target and crossed the  100 MTPA milestone, becoming the ninth-largest  cement company globally. Adani Airports also had a record year of growth.  It launched Aviio – India’s first unified airport operations  app as well as reinforced its position as the country’s  fastest-growing airport operator. We handled a record  94 million passengers in FY 2024-25, registering a  7% growth. We also completed the first test flight at  the greenfield Navi Mumbai Airport, which will open  later this year with an initial passenger capacity of  20   million of what will eventually become a 90 million  passenger airport. When it comes to Adani Defence, we now stand at  the dawn of a new era. Our world-class ammunition  and missile capabilities in Kanpur is a vision to forge  one of South Asia's most formidable complexes.  When Operation Sindoor called, we delivered.  Our surveillance drones became the eyes in the skies,  our kamikaze drones became the swift swords of  attack, and our anti-drone systems became the shield  to help protect our forces and citizens. Every innovation  we make and every system we build is a salute to  the courage of our Armed Forces. This is the spirit of  affordable 1,000-bed campuses in Ahmedabad and  Mumbai with medical colleges, research centres and  wellness spaces all integrated together. Mayo Clinic  is our partner in guiding us to create a future-ready,  AI-powered, patient-first healthcare ecosystem. In parallel, we have committed  `  2,000 crore to build  a world-class skill university and finishing school in  Mundra, designed to empower youth from across India.  Through Schools of Excellence, global certifications  and partnerships with leaders like ITEES Singapore and  IGCC, we aim to create an industry-ready workforce.  This is more than philanthropy – it is our promise to  India because we believe that we are building not just  institutions, but legacies of transformation. And finally, let me end by talking about our participation  at the Maha Kumbh Mela. Over 650 million people  came together, not as strangers, but as one soul.  One purpose. One heartbeat. Along with ISKCON, the  Adani Group initiated the Mahaprasad Seva, offering  free meals to lakhs of devotees. More than 5,000 of our  employees volunteered wholeheartedly, reflecting the  values we cherish. With my family, I had the honour of performing the  sacred Ganga Aarti at the Triveni Sangam – and for  the Adani Group to be part of this was one of the  most moving days of my life. For me, the Maha Kumbh  is not just a festival. It is India’s soul on display – a  living testimony to our resilience, our unity and our  unwavering faith. And we were grateful to have had the  opportunity to perform seva at this year's Maha Kumbh. Let me conclude by saying that history should  remember us not for the size of our balance sheet,  but for the strength of our backbone. Not just for the  markets we entered, but for the storms we handled and  emerged stronger. For it is easy to lead in sunshine, but  true leadership is forged in the face of crisis. Strength is not just power – it is purpose, clarity and the  will to rise. And resilience is not endurance alone – it is  reinvention in the face of adversity. When combined, it  helps us do our part for building an India that refuses to  bend, refuses to break and never stops believing in its  own future. That is our truth. That is our legacy. That is our promise. The greatest chapters of our story are still ahead.  Thank you for being on this journey with us.

Our journey is  not just about  where we stand  today as India’s  leading private port  operator, but about  the transformative  direction we’re  pursuing —  becoming an  Integrated  Transport Utility - KARAN ADANI Managing Director MESSAGE  FROM  MANAGING  DIRECTOR  In 2024, the global economy showed resilience with  3.2% growth, steady demand, and a well-functioning  supply chain despite high interest rates. Dear Shareholder, It is a pleasure to present APSEZ’s  FY   2024 - 25 Annual Report. Our journey  is not just about where we stand today as  India’s leading private port operator, but  about the transformative direction we’re  pursuing – becoming an Integrated Transport  Utility. We are investing boldly in expansion,  decarbonisation, and automation to  consolidate domestic leadership, strengthen  our logistics capability, and grow globally. Global Trade and India’s Rising  Significance In 2024, the global economy showed  resilience with 3.2% growth, steady demand,  and a well-functioning supply chain despite  high interest rates. Global trade grew 3.7%  to USD 33 trillion, supported by strong  performances from India and China. Trade is  expected to continue growing, driven by  container shipping, auto products, and air  freight. However, rising geopolitical tensions  and protectionism – especially U.S.-led  tariff wars – pose fragmentation risks.  Businesses must remain agile to navigate this  complex terrain. Under these circumstances, India stands at  a pivotal point globally. Despite GDP growth  moderating to 6.2%, the outlook remains  robust, fuelled by manufacturing-led growth  and Make in India programme, infrastructure  expansion, and energy transition.  With growing manufacturing capabilities and  global supply chain shifts favouring India, the  nation is on course to become a USD 5 trillion  economy and the third-largest globally. The Logistics Challenge and  Reforms   Push Despite its economic growth, India’s high  logistics cost at 13-14% of GDP, which is  far above global benchmarks, remains a  bottleneck. Poor infrastructure, fragmented  regulations, and digital lag further contribute  to inefficiencies. Addressing these is key to  realising India’s ambition of USD 1 trillion in  annual merchandise exports by 2030. In order  to make India’s logistics sector a true growth  enabler, by bringing down its share in GDP to  8-9%, India needs to invest USD 3 trillion. Recognising this challenge, the Indian  Government’s relentless policy reforms are  catalysing transformation. National priority  programmes like PM Gati Shakti, Sagarmala,  and the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 are  modernising ports and improving last-mile  logistics. Free trade agreements and trade  diversification efforts further bolster India’s  global trade posture. 32 33 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED 

APSEZ: Accelerating National Growth APSEZ has invested aggressively in the  past five years to support this national  transformation. Through organic and  inorganic growth, we’ve built a network  of 15 ports in India and four overseas,  offering multi-cargo handling, strong  hinterland connectivity, and integrated  logistics   solutions. Our digitalisation efforts have created  efficient, tech-enabled port-to-gate services.  We are also leveraging our 18,000+ acre  landbank to promote industrialisation,  unlocking additional economic value. With a  cargo volume CAGR of 24.1% from FY   2002 - 25  (versus India’s 6.3%), we have consistently  outpaced industry growth and delivered on  5-year targets for cargo, revenue, EBITDA,  and   ROCE. Ambition for the Next Phase With our impressive evolution, the most  pertinent question before us is – What next?  How do we take our customers and the nation  ahead? How do we maximise value creation?  On the one hand, we must move swiftly  to capitalise on opportunities and on the  other, bring in our expertise to stay agile and  nimble. These realities call for decisive and  bigger   actions. APSEZ will generate an operating cashflow  of more than  `  1 lakh crore between  FY   2026-30. These will be targeted at  expanding domestic ports and logistics  businesses and international port and marine  operations. Through this, we secure the  Our sustainability efforts have earned global  recognition:    Top 10 globally in the transport sector  by S&P Global CSA    ‘A-’ Leadership rating from CDP    ‘Low’ ESG risk rating from Sustainalytics    ‘Prime’ status from ISS ESG, enabling  responsible investments in our  equity and bonds We are also establishing skill development  centres at selected locations to train local  youth with industry-relevant skills, creating a  seamless talent supply chain to meet growing  manpower needs. Following the electrification of cranes and  the deployment of  electric internal transfer  vehicles  (E-ITVs), we have also introduced  electric reach stackers and empty handlers  at our port. In the near future, we intend to  develop an ecosystem of electricity-based  equipment and vehicles both within and  outside the port as technology progresses. We are committed to community  development, having empowered thousands  through health, education, and livelihood  initiatives. Employee safety, diversity, and  welfare remain priorities. Strong governance underpins our approach.  A majority of our Board members are  independent and committed to regulatory  compliance, stakeholder protection, and  ESG   excellence. path to 1 billion tonnes in cargo volumes  by 2030, with enhanced contribution from  international ports at 15% as compared to 5%  in   FY   2024-25. The logistics vertical is on track to deliver a  stellar revenue growth in next 5 years with  the addition of the new trucking and freight  forwarding segment that is expected to be  the largest revenue contributor alongside  significant expansions across all   segments. Our marine services business is also growing  at a face pace and expected to grow by more  than 3x in the next two years, with expansion  of services in new geographies and addition  of new fleet. All of this would not be possible without  a solid financial foundation. Our average  transformation of EBITDA to operating  cashflows is healthy at over 70%. With over  50% sticky cargo in our mix and the ongoing  diversification, we expect cash flow  generation to be robust, providing us a war  chest for aggressive expansion. Sustainability and Inclusivity: Our  Critical Pillars We aim to be the world’s most sustainable  transport utility and have committed to  net-zero emissions by 2040. This includes  deploying 1,000 MW of renewable energy  (200 MW solar, 52 MW wind, 25 MW hybrid  already commissioned) and transitioning to  electricity-based equipment. We now operate  a fleet of 400 electric internal transfer  vehicles, with recent additions in Colombo. The Road Ahead India’s coming decade is promising – powered  by demographic strength, infrastructure  growth, manufacturing self-reliance, and  clean energy transitions. The Union Budget  2025 reinforces this momentum, emphasising  logistics-led growth and competitiveness. APSEZ is fully aligned with this vision. As a  future-ready Integrated Transport Utility,  we’re focussed on expansion, efficiency,  and customer centricity. By enabling the  smooth and cost-efficient movement of  goods across India and beyond, we aim to  accelerate national development and unlock  stakeholder   value.

Our domestic ports  revenue grew by  12%, supported by  an unprecedented  market share  of 27% and a  commendable  EBITDA margin  of 73%. Notably,  Mundra Port  became the first  Indian port to  exceed 200 million  metric tonnes of  cargo handled in a  single year. - ASHWANI GUPTA Chief Executive Officer MESSAGE  FROM THE  CEO We aspire to become the world’s leading transport  utility company by delivering customer-centric services  through a technology-driven infrastructure ecosystem. Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board of Directors at APSEZ,  I extend our heartfelt thanks to all our  stakeholders for your unwavering trust and  support over the past year. I am pleased to report that during FY 2024-25,  APSEZ achieved remarkable performance  across all key metrics. We experienced robust  growth, with revenue, EBITDA, and net profit  increasing by 16%, 20%, and 37% respectively,  surpassing our guidance for the year, including  cargo volume targets. Our domestic ports revenue grew by 12%,  supported by an unprecedented market share  of 27% and a commendable EBITDA margin of  73%. Notably, Mundra Port became the first  Indian port to exceed 200 million metric tonnes  of cargo handled in a single year. We are looking at our entire business in  three growth pillars: Ports, Logistics and  Marine Services. For our first pillar, which is  Ports – throughout the year, we expanded  our domestic and international presence  significantly. We successfully completed the  acquisition of Gopalpur, commenced operations  at Vizhinjam and Colombo ports, and received  Board approval for the acquisition of NQXT  in Queensland, Australia. Logistics segment,  our second pillar, continued its impressive  trajectory, achieving a 39% year-on-year  increase in revenue driven by our existing  portfolio and the introduction of new business  segments such as trucking and international  freight network services. As the third pillar of our operations, the marine  business continues to grow. Following the  acquisition of Astro Offshore and continued  investments in fleet expansion, we now operate  a robust fleet of 115 vessels across the Middle  East, Africa, and South Asia. This growth has been underpinned by our  steadfast commitment to financial discipline.  Last year, we set a clear target to reduce our  net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to between 2.2x and  2.5x. We exceeded this goal, closing the year at  1.9x – an improvement from 2.3x the previous  year and 3.3x in FY 2020-21. This strengthened  financial position gives us the flexibility to  confidently pursue future opportunities. Our vision aligns with India’s moment  of logistics transformation We aspire to become the world’s leading  transport utility company by delivering  customer-centric services through a  technology-driven infrastructure ecosystem.  By leveraging our assets, expertise, and  strategic partnerships, we aim to redefine  excellence in integrated transport solutions. With visionary leadership and sustained  growth, I believe this is not just India’s decade   –  it is India’s century. India is already on track  to become third-largest economy in the world  and reach to USD 5 trillion soon. As we rise  on the global stage, India is set to shape trade  policies and drive global discourse, becoming a  force for positive change. Our robust growth is  further supported by accommodative monetary  policy and stable inflation. Despite global trade  36 37 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED 

volatility, India’s merchandise trade remains  resilient, propelled by proactive governance  and strategic economic agreements. Several key factors reinforce this  momentum:    Industrialisation:  Global manufacturing  companies are adopting geographical  diversification approach and trying to reduce  the dependency on certain geographies  due to geopolitical tensions, supply chain  disruptions and rising costs. India is poised  to become a biggest beneficiary of this  strategic shift leveraging its infrastructure,  skilled workforce and growing manufacturing  capabilities. As manufacturing scales up, the  demand for raw material and containerisation  of intermediate and finished goods increases    Infrastructure:  Strategic investments in  ports, transport corridors, multi-modal  logistics parks, and digital infrastructure  enhance connectivity and improve efficiency,  making exports more competitive    Energy:  Growing industrialisation and  penetration of cooling systems will drive  energy demand. This is expected to drive  the volume of coastal coal and imported  thermal coal. The railway policies are also  encouraging the conversion of all rail route  to Rail-Sea-Rail movement of thermal coal.  The expansion of renewable energy also  contributes to containerised volume, while  increasing refinery capacity drives crude oil  imports and POL exports    Agricultural:  Enhanced cold chain logistics  and the development of high-quality  Agri-silos are reducing wastage, improving  food security, and increasing cargo  movement from rural to urban markets With over 95% of India’s trade by volume and  70% by value occurring via sea, our maritime  actively addressing these inefficiencies by  investing across the entire logistics value chain  – including rail connectivity, inland container  depots (ICDs), warehousing, and last-mile  delivery – thus catering our customers with  end-to-end supply chain solutions. As the largest port operator in the country, we  manage over 27% of India's EXIM cargo volume,  which provides us with a robust customer base  for offering logistics services. Additionally, our  Agri logistics business is set to grow in tandem  with the Food Corporation of India’s (FCI)  expansion of Agri silos, enhancing food security  and supply chain efficiency. We have launched new customer-facing  platforms and are investing further in strategic  command centres and a Trucking Management  Solution. These initiatives will enhance fleet  utilisation, ensure SLA adherence, enable  real-time troubleshooting, and ultimately  deliver a superior customer experience. These strategic advantages, combined with  our technological advancements, position us  to lead the transformation of India’s logistics  landscape – and become the country’s largest  integrated transport utility company. Marine has emerged as our third business pillar,  poised to drive exponential growth for APSEZ.  We are building a comprehensive marine  ecosystem by expanding our service offerings  and geographic footprint, with a focus on the  Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. We will  also be adding new capacities in line with the  Indian Government’s Make-in-India programme  to capture the needs of the future Indian  maritime sector. To support this growth, we are committed to  equipping our workforce with future-ready  skills. We are establishing specialised training  industry is poised to benefit significantly.  APSEZ domestic port volumes are growing  twice as fast as the Indian maritime sector,  positioning us as a key beneficiary. Manufacturing growth and increased trade  set the logistics sector on a solid growth  trajectory, projected to expand at 8–9%  annually. These elements establish a strong  foundation for sustained growth, making  logistics a cornerstone of India's economic  transformation. With your continued support,  we are confident in our ability to meet and  exceed our goals. Scaling Infrastructure for a Future- Ready Global Logistics Network We are strategically scaling our infrastructure  to meet future demand. Our domestic ports  currently have an EC-approved capacity of  1,560   MMT – more than double our existing  operational capacity of 633   MMT – which  positions us well to respond swiftly as market  needs evolve. Domestically, major capacity expansions are  underway at Vizhinjam and Mundra, where  we are deploying state-of-the-art automated  terminal technologies. To further enhance  operational efficiency, we are establishing a  centralised Command and Control Centre and  completing a major upgrade of our Terminal  Operating System (TOS) within the year. Internationally, we are expanding terminal  capacities in Colombo and Tanzania, while  deepening integration of Haifa and NQXT into  our global portfolio. India’s logistics sector remains fragmented  and needs efficiency enhancement, currently  accounting for 13–14% of the country’s GDP.  We see this as a significant opportunity. We are  schools to accelerate this mission. This year, we  are also launching skill development centres  at select locations to empower local youth  with industry-relevant capabilities – creating  a strong talent pipeline to meet our evolving  human resources needs. Growth with Stability Going forward, we adopt a cautiously  optimistic stance. Our focus is on maximising  opportunities while negating risks by closely  monitoring global trade and geopolitical  developments, policy shifts and a wave of tariff  regimes enacted by the US government. We will  continue to build on our financial discipline  and drive robust cash flow generations to  fund growth plans. This approach will preserve  balance sheet integrity and provide financial  cushion against uncertainties. We are confident in our strategic direction,  both within the country and, more significantly,  on the international stage. Our focus is on  establishing a strong presence along the  Southeast Asia–India–Middle East–Africa  corridor. We are expanding our logistics  and marine business in line with our core  philosophy of managing and operating the  entire ecosystem seamlessly. I thank all our stakeholders for putting their  trust in us. We are confident in executing our  strategy to ensure a resilient path forward  to sustained value creation and shaping the  future of ports and logistics industry. Ashwani Gupta Chief Executive Officer India’s logistics sector remains fragmented and needs  efficiency enhancement, currently accounting for  13–14% of the country’s GDP.

Materiality assessment Unlocking  lasting value  by addressing  key issues In advancing our ESG agenda, we  actively address a broad spectrum  of issues arising from our operations  and their impact on stakeholders.  By integrating materiality insights  into our strategic planning, we  ensure  our sustainability objectives  address stakeholder expectations  while strengthening our business  performance and promoting  environmental stewardship.  Consequently,  the outcome of the  exercise helps us to align our ESG  efforts with strategic priorities, risks  and opportunities, while ensuring  long-term value generation. Our Approach to Materiality At APSEZ, we have been conducting annual materiality  assessment since 2015, with a comprehensive review and  update undertaken every two years to ensure relevance  and alignment with evolving stakeholder expectations  and ESG priorities. Our previous materiality assessment  was conducted in FY 2022-23 in alignment with the  principles of double materiality, wherein we gathered  insights from both internal and external stakeholders. In FY 2023-24, we conducted an internal review of  material topics, aligning our analysis with global  ESG frameworks, emerging trends in the ports and  logistics sector, and peer benchmarking insights.  A comprehensive bottom-up materiality assessment has  been carried out in the current fiscal year, following the  approach of double materiality to gain fresh insights  and update the list of material topics. The assessment  has been conducted in accordance with the  guidance provided by key standard setting bodies  and frameworks, particularly GRI Standards 2021, and  European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We initiated the assessment by identification of key  stakeholders which has been performed in accordance  with the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard,  that provides guidance on identification and  engagement with stakeholders. We charted a four-step approach as part of the analysis: Identify Questionnaire Development &  Stakeholder Consultation Assess & Prioritise Monitoring & Validation Structured Process to Materiality The materiality assessment process followed a structured  and methodical approach which commenced with an  understanding of the organisational context – high-level  overview of our activities, business relationships,  stakeholders, and sustainability requirements of all our  entities. This groundwork supported in identifying ESG  considerations, pertaining to our business.

2.     Questionnaire Development and Stakeholder  Consultation:  Building upon the insights  gathered from the identification process,  we developed materiality assessment  questionnaires relevant to respective  stakeholder groups. The questionnaires focussed  upon capturing the significance to our business  and the impact on stakeholders.     With a keen emphasis on capturing diverse  perceptions, the questionnaire was circulated  among all internal and external stakeholders  for their valuable input. For assessing the  impacts from impact materiality perspective,  scale, scope, and irremediable character  were considered in case of negative impacts.  Additionally, likelihood of occurrence was  considered in case of potential impacts.     To determine the financial implications from  company’s value perspective, the responses  were sought from the senior management on  scale of impacts, likelihood of occurrence as well  as potential financial effects of the risks and  opportunities identified. 3.     Assess and Prioritise:  The feedback gathered  from consultation with internal and external  stakeholders was thoroughly analysed  considering both financial and impact  materiality. The analysis was carried out using  a defined scoring methodology. This analysis  prioritised impacts and associated risks and  opportunities from the wide range of responses  we gathered. Furthermore, the outcome  was summarised in the materiality matrix-  representing the significance of material topics  from high to medium to low priority. 4.     Monitoring and Validation:  We have aligned  our ESG Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  with relevant material topics, Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs), strategic priorities,  and risks. These material topics are integrated  into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)  framework and undergo annual review to ensure  alignment with our business model, strategy and  decisions including CAPEX and OPEX planning.  Our Chief Risk Officer provides an oversight  of the assessment process.

Identify:  Since impact and financial materiality  are interconnected, we adopted the double  materiality approach for our evaluation of key  topics. This comprises the consideration of  the effects of the organisation's actions on  stakeholders and the environment, coupled with  the financial implications for the company which  necessitates adjustments to business strategy,  including investment decisions, business model  and management choices to mitigate risks or  benefit from opportunities. The identification  process entailed an analysis of sector-specific  dynamics and operational intricacies, in line  with the global benchmarks and international  standards. These impacts were categorised under  Environmental, Social and Governance dimension.  The two perspectives of materiality assessment are  elaborated below:   a)     Impact  Materiality:  Under impact materiality,  we considered the context of our organisation,  its sector, and operations to determine several  actual or potential and positive or negative  impacts on the economy, environment  and people. These impacts were further  categorised as reversible or irreversible,  short-term or long-term.   b)     Financial  Materiality:  For financial materiality,  we identified risks and opportunities of the  identified impacts to determine financial  considerations, carried out through the  analysis of responses of senior leadership.

It may also affect our relationship  with local community who depend  on the marine resources like  fish catch, for their livelihood.  The mitigation of these risks is  essential for maintaining business  sustainability and trustworthiness. Type of impact Biodiversity and Land Use Business Case Ports and logistics, being pivotal in  global supply chains and economic  workflow, often require land-use  changes to accommodate growing  infrastructure demands. This can  disrupt local communities, harm  natural habitats, and intensify  pollution. Port activities such as  dredging can also damage marine  habitats, disturbing the aquatic  environment. Our aim is to address  these issues by harmonising  economic advancement,  environmental preservation, and  social responsibility. At APSEZ, our biodiversity  strategies aim to bolster  conservation and sustainability,  reflecting our commitment  to protecting and enhancing  biodiversity.

Risk and opportunities  Managing risks and  unlocking potential  We operate across diverse businesses and locations globally, exposing  our organisation to internal and external risks. With a multilayered risk  management system and a robust governance framework, we navigate this  dynamic landscape while ensuring our operating controls are aligned with  the Group’s overarching vision and mission. This proactive approach enables  achieving our strategic objectives and strengthens business resilience.  Our Approach to Enterprise Risk  Management (ERM) We have a comprehensive and matured ERM  framework to effectively manage both financial  and non-financial risks and achieve strategic  objectives. The framework provides a systematic  approach to identifying, prioritising, managing,  monitoring, and reporting key and emerging risks  in a timely, comprehensive manner. Based on the  globally recognised Committee of Sponsoring  Organisations (COSO) framework for ERM, it  ensures the seamless integration of internal  controls into our business processes. Risk management is also integrated with the  business planning and compliance functions.  To promote an effective risk culture, we  have mandated risk-related awareness and  training programmes for employees to build  awareness of the ERM framework and promote  an effective risk culture. This includes regular  risk management training for all non-executive  directors and focussed training throughout the  organisation on risk management principles.  We also conduct function-specific risk training,  alongside multi-functional climate change and  sustainability training by internal and external  resources. Additionally, we incorporate risk  criteria in developing our services and provide  financial incentives that incorporate risk  management metrics. Risk Governance Mechanism We have integrated a dual approach to risk  management, which includes:    Bottom-up approach: Identification and  regular assessment of risks by our ports,  logistics, agri-logistics, service units,  and corporate functions, followed by  effective mitigation    Top-down approach: Identification and  evaluation of long-term, strategic, and macro  risks by the Risk Management Group (Senior  Leadership Team) and the Risk Management  Committee (RMC) The RMC, chaired by an independent director,  and various Board sub-committees constituted  under it oversee the ERM process, including  framing, implementing, and monitoring the  risk management plan. The Committee meets  at least once every quarter to review risk  exposure and management plans on behalf of  the Board. The RMC comprises three members,  all non-executive directors, with two also being  independent directors. All three members have  diverse business experience and extensive risk  management exposure. Our risk management framework is structured  across three lines of defence with clear roles and  responsibilities:    First Line:  Site Risk Managers (location  heads and designated site risk managers)  prioritise and approve site-level operational  risks and implement mitigation plans.  Department Risk Representatives (HODs)  identify and log critical risks, implement  mitigation strategies, and assist with ongoing  lead indicator assessments    Second Line:  The Head of ESG (Chief Risk  Officer) sets control standards and oversees  compliance, ensuring adherence to the highest  risk management standards, and reports  directly to the CEO    Third Line:  The Management Audit &  Assurance Services (MA&AS) team,  comprising expert accountants, engineers,  and SAP executives, monitors and audits  risk management performance across all  functions. They provide objective assurance  on the effectiveness of our risk management  and compliance processes and report directly  to the Chairman of the Board. The MA&AS  team also conducts systematic internal audits,  performed by qualified internal auditors, at  least annually to ensure our risk management  framework remains robust and effective 88 89 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED

This included climate-related physical risks  such as rising sea levels and extreme weather  events (storms, flooding, droughts and severe  winds) and transition risks that comprise  technological, regulatory and market changes for  a lower-carbon economy. Sensitivity Analysis We have carried out sensitivity analysis involving  changing driver metrics linked to various financial  and operational parameters while keeping all  the other parameters constant. The analysis  indicated that a one-day closure of APSEZ’s  largest Mundra Port would result in a loss  before tax of  `  14 crore, while the closure of  all the ports would cause a loss of  `  50 crore. With increasing climate change, the likelihood  of intensity and frequency of extreme  weather events will increase in future which  may result in greater disruption of port  operations. We have conducted a climate  vulnerability assessment and risk exposure of  12 of our ports considering 1.5 O C and greater  than 2 O C scenarios of IPCC AR6. Based on  this, a detailed adaptation plan has been  created for four of our most at-risk ports.

Emerging Risks Amid changing political, economic, social, environmental, legal and technological circumstances, our business is  inevitably facing emerging risks. We identify emerging risks as those strategic risks that may become material in the  medium (3-10 years) to long term (> 10 years) if not appropriately mitigated now. We see technological changes for ports and changing geoeconomics leading to a shift in cargo demand as the  key emerging risks. While both these factors are strategic to business with the potential to impact the cost and  profitability in the medium to long term, their magnitude of impact does not cross our risk appetite at present.  However, we are taking appropriate mitigating measures at the highest level to minimise any residual risks for the  business in future. Skill gaps in workforce  to adopt to technological  advancements/automation Major ports worldwide  are increasingly adopting  automation. APSEZ must  therefore build capabilities  to leverage digitalisation  and technology adoption  to stay competitive. The lack of technologically  adept manpower though  poses a risk, requiring  significant investments in  their skilling.    Shortage of skilled  manpower and lack of  capabilities to support  large-scale integrated and  automated port operations  and handle crises    Potential of growth,  productivity gains and  profit from automation  falling short of expectations  due to lack of data  to make integration  possible and high capital  expenditure involved    Risk of losing the advantage  of cost competitiveness  driven by low-cost  labour in India We have initiated and have  in the pipeline several  smaller automation projects  to build the necessary  systems, processes  and knowledge base.  This is gradually building  our internal capabilities and  team’s readiness.

Climate change Amid the fast-aggravating climate change crisis facing humanity, APSEZ remains on track with its ambitious goal to  be Carbon Neutral by 2025. Our Climate Strategy Led by our sustained focus on reducing the ecological impact of our business for the realisation of our 2025 Carbon  Neutrality goal, we have pillared our climate strategy around: This strategy is aimed at enhancing our operational  resilience towards the climate change impacts.   It also seeks to develop robust frameworks to integrate  climate change considerations. Our carbon reduction and resource  preservation efforts are driven by our  initiatives to conserve water, reduce  waste, and adopt energy-efficient  technologies. Reducing  greenhouse  emissions Utilising  renewable  energy sources Improving  energy  efficiency Climate Vulnerability Risk Given the heavy reliance of our business infrastructure on the sea, we have conducted a Climate Vulnerability Risk  Assessment study. The study has identified Mundra, Dhamra, Hazira, and Krishnapatnam ports as being vulnerable  to climate change-related risks. It has shown that the rise in sea levels due to global warming poses a significant  threat to our port facilities, resulting in higher indirect costs, increased turnaround times, and reduced operational  efficiency. It is imperative for us to take proactive measures to manage these risks effectively. Reduce Our Impact  Through low carbon  pathway commitments,  reduce emissions in  operations and supply chain Build Resilience Enhance physical and  strategic resilience of both  our operations and key  stakeholders Strengthen the System Develop a robust system to  track and ensure integration  of climate change in relevant  business activities To ensure the effective implementation of our strategic roadmap, we are continuously investing in strengthening  these levers. Regular assessment of the progress is undertaken, and the relevant strategies are adapted as needed.  Stakeholder collaboration is another important driver of our strategy. Sustainable  infrastructure  development Resource  planning Process optimisation  through technological  interventions Fulfilling the national/  international standards  or guidelines Positive legal  compliance 5 Levers of Our Net-Zero Journey We have adopted a well-defined strategic roadmap to drive our efforts towards Net-Zero by 2040 – a key goal of our  climate strategy. The roadmap is structured around five levers, each of which complements and reinforces the other.  a) Climate Governance Our climate governance  framework is headed by the APSEZ  Board. Supported by Corporate  Responsibility Committee (CRC),  Corporate Social Responsibility  Committee (CSRC), Stakeholders’  Relationship Committee (SRC)  and Risk Management Committee  (RMC), the Board monitors  performance, adherence to the  standards, and risks faced within  the organisation.  Corporate Responsibility  Committee (CRC)     Oversees implementation of  the ESG strategy and policies,  including the management of  transition risks and delivery  against ESG targets    Management of ESG priorities is  embedded across the business  segments, at the corporate  and business unit levels,  flowing from the Board    Reviews corporate level  performance against  environmental and social metrics,  and develops a strategy ESG Team     Develops the  Company’s ESG agenda    Supports business functions in  driving implementation ESG Head (Chief Risk Officer)    Handles business risk  management at executive level    Reports directly to CEO to  ensure independence from  other functions Risk Management With climate-related risks becoming  important to our risk management  process, we have put in place  a systematic risk management  approach as part of our climate  governance framework.     Comprises Group-level Risk  Management Team to track the  changes in the external and  internal business environments  in real-time, and take  counter measures    The ERM and risk assurance  procedure is integrated with  the business planning and  compliance functions    ESG Head engages with  Risk Management and  Audit Committee on all  climate change risks    ESG Head also updates the  committee on the company’s  enterprise risk management    Responsibility to identify and  respond to climate change risk  lies with Chief Executive Officer  (CEO) at business unit level  and site-level environmental  management teams, along  with cross-functional teams,  at the site level    Board of directors discusses  climate-related issues annually Climate Action Amid the growing global climate  change crisis, the need for  urgent and exhaustive action has  become accentuated. The Paris  Agreement, aimed at limiting  the temperature increase to 1.5  degrees Celsius, as well as the COP  29, which underlined the need  for collective and strong action  towards the Paris Agreement  goal, are aligned to the world’s  battle against climate change.

Climate-Related Management Incentives We encourage active participation by our stakeholders, including our employees, in our climate strategy. We offer  them various climate-related incentives (financial and non-financial) for promoting actions that contribute to  mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable practices. The incentives are aimed at rewarding and recognising individuals or entities that demonstrate exceptional efforts  in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adopting renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and  promoting climate resilience. a) MADHYAM    On-line reward scheme introduced at  Group level in 2016    Provides employees with a channel  to share their ideas, suggestions,  and insights on strategy, operations,  organisation, CSR, financial and  technology with the Chairman    Ideas assessed at various level from  the perspective of value addition  or financial impact – ranging from  `  5,000 to  `  50,000 (based on  impact sphere – Group, business unit  or department level), awarded to the  employee by the Chairman if the idea  is implemented on ground    Activities incentivised: Emissions  reduction project, Emission reduction  strategy, Emissions reduction target,  Energy reduction project, Energy  reduction target, Efficiency project,  Company performance against a  climate-related sustainability index b) Employee Spot  Recognition Scheme    For promoting  a sense of  belongingness  and motivation  among employees    Recognises and  rewards exemplary  behaviour/ contribution of  employees for  implementing best  practices in energy  saving, waste  management &  greener commute c) Employees Award &  Recognition for Technical  Projects    Launched in 2018 to  encourage and motivate  technical professionals    Focussed on plant  performance (energy  efficiency) enhancement  and adoption of  advanced technology  to achieve business  goals through scientific  approaches towards  business suitability and  plant reliability Employees Type of Incentive    Corporate ESG targets cascaded to divisional & departmental levels across sites    (all ports, logistics & agri logistics)    Individual targets set for each site    Separate tracker for each site and division, with quarterly target set for FY 2024-25    Divisional owners (usually CEOs and Heads of the section at corporate level) have such  targets in their dashboards    Each department has a cascaded target (e.g. Engineering service, Horticulture, Marine  operation); HoDs own the said target    Performance evaluation assesses target achievement and outcome is linked  with variable pay Business  Unit  Managers Type of Incentive    Variable pay linked to various financial and ESG indicators – Revenue, EBIDTA, ROCE, Health  & Safety, Energy Intensity, GHG Intensity, Water Intensity, Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL), and  Mangrove afforestation area    On recommendation of Nomination and Remuneration Committee, remuneration paid/  payable by way of salary, perquisites and allowances (fixed component), incentive and/or  commission (variable components), to Executive Directors within the limits prescribed  under the Act is approved by the Board of Directors and by the shareholders in the  General Meeting CEO Type of Incentive    10% of the compensation linked to ESG performance and organisation performance Others Type of Incentive Climate Risk Assessment We are cognisant of the potential impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, changing weather patterns,  and extreme weather events, on our operations. We undertake climate risk assessment to: We rely on the guidance of the  Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  to manage and report  on climate-related risks.  TCFD provides a framework for  categorising and addressing  such risks. Following the  TCFD recommendations helps  in better understanding  and managing the potential  financial impact of  climate-related risks on our  business, and in developing  suitable strategies to  address   them. Climate Change Scenario Analysis In pursuance of our climate risk process, we have undertaken qualitative  and quantitative climate change scenario analysis. The analysis seeks to  explore climate vulnerabilities to enhance our resilience to climate-related  risks. The approach helps in assessing and understanding the potential  impacts of climate change on various systems, such as ecosystems,  economies, and societies.  We consider different climate change scenarios to understand and identify  a wide range of possibilities, covering different levels of risk, uncertainty  and volatility. This, in turn, enables us to ensure that our assets and  operations are equipped and capable of managing climate-related risks  effectively, and are also empowered to seize any resultant opportunities.  We have conducted climate-related scenario analysis on two scenarios:   2°C or below 2°C, and Above 2°C.  Identify, assess  and manage short-,  medium- and long-term  risks, including  climate-related risks,  on an ongoing basis. Identify material,  physical and transition  climate-related  financial risks  and potential  business   impacts. Systematically identify,  evaluate, and mitigate  potential risks associated  with climate change to  ensure the resilience  of our operations and  infrastructure. 156 157 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED 

Emissions Reduction Plan As part of our Carbon Neutrality Roadmap to achieve net zero carbon  emissions by 2040, we have set forth an emission mitigation plan,  aimed at:  a)   Reducing energy intensity by operation and maintenance excellence  b)   Achieving fuel-switch through electrification of equipment, such as  RTGs, MHCs, ITVs, and locomotives c)   Sourcing the entire electricity from renewable sources  d)   Offsetting the remainder emissions We conducted a Climate Change  Vulnerability Risk Assessment for  the infrastructure related to our  port operations. The assessment  was conducted in line with the  guidelines suggested by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) and best practices  for climate risk analysis. This was  followed by a qualitative evaluation  for the four most vulnerable ports,  based on which we identified the  implementation timeframe and the  expected cost implications of the  adaptive measures. Till date, we  have completed the Climate Risk  Vulnerability Assessment for 14  ports to determine their exposure  and sensitivity to changing climate. Managing Climate-Related Risk The leadership team, Board and relevant committees at APSEZ provide  oversight of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties annually.  Our internal controls include policies, processes, management systems,  organisational structures and standards to manage the various business  and associated risks. The Group’s operational risk committee provides  oversight of operational risk management for the Group, including risks  related to climate change and sustainability. Acute (extreme weather events)  Chronic (changing weather  patterns and rising mean  temperature and sea level)  Physical Risk  Policy and Legal Technology Market Reputation Transition Risk a) Internal Carbon Pricing We deploy an internal carbon pricing (ICP) mechanism to help minimise our GHG emissions by navigating and  mitigating the potential financial impacts of the existing and anticipated GHG regulations. This helps in driving low  carbon investments and energy efficiency within the organisation. Prior to project  implementation, we  conduct a thorough  evaluation of  greenhouse gas (GHG)  projects from a financial  perspective In case of high  projected GHG  emissions, we  prioritise the  assessment of better  technologies that  can help reduce  emissions.  This enables our projects  to not only meet the  financial objectives  but also contribute  to environmental  sustainability by actively  seeking and adopting  cleaner and more  efficient solutions.  ICP is also used  as a strategic  tool to align  with stakeholder  expectations and  catalyse behavioural  changes within their  operations.  We have implemented an internal carbon pricing mechanism, applying a price of USD 20 per metric tonne of  CO 2  equivalent (tCO 2 e) on all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our operations. We set aside an equivalent  cumulative amount for investment in renewable projects and energy efficiency measures. As a result, in    FY 2024-25, APSEZ generated a fund of USD 9.5 million through this carbon pricing measure. b)   Enabling Low-Carbon Services In line with our commitment to contributing actively towards a low-carbon society, we offer our customers  a range of sustainable solutions to help them reduce their carbon footprint. We are focussed on providing  integrated logistics solutions to our customers, with the objective of enhancing the sustainability of our  services. We aim to offer more sustainable transportation options to them, going forward. In FY 2024-25, we used internal  accruals and debt to invest  `   1,664 crore in projects related  to procurement of new cranes,  electrification of equipment, rail  infra, energy efficiency, emission  reduction, environment protection,  water management, waste treatment  and adaptation to climate change.  `  934 crore  Total expenditure on  environmental initiatives of  which  `   512 crore was spent on  renewable generation   plant `  137 crore  Spent on Breakwater  construction Given the growing concerns  surrounding greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions and their impact  on global warming, there is an  increasing focus on addressing  the issue. Global businesses  face a serious potential impact  on their agendas as a result of  climate commitments, pledges, and  associated actions, as indicated  by the recent COP27 negotiations.  The need for decisive action to  mitigate GHG emissions for building  a sustainable and resilient future for  all cannot be overstated. At APSEZ, energy efficiency  measures are being implemented  across all operational locations.  Our efforts are focussed on  enhancing the proportion or  renewable energy (solar, wind  power) in the total energy mix.  We aim to continue to invest in  decarbonising our operations  through electrification and use of  renewable energy, through effective  actions, collaboration with partners,  and innovation. We strive to reduce  the emissions through efficient  utilisation of energy with the  overarching aim of decarbonising  our operations.    Aligned to our "Carbon Neutral  by 2025" goal, we are continually  striving to increase energy  efficiency at all our operational  sites through operational and  maintenance excellence and  increase in the percentage  of renewable energy sources  (solar and wind power) in the  overall energy mix    As part of our Energy and  Emissions Policy, we take several  innovative measures to promote  the adoption of advanced  technologies and strengthen the  GHG emissions reduction process    We undertake regular  measurement, monitoring and  review of our GHG emissions  in accordance with our  environmental policy    We measure, monitor, and review  our GHG emissions, adhering  to the GHG Protocol corporate  accounting and reporting  standard, which covers seven  greenhouse gases recognised by  the Kyoto Protocol - carbon dioxide  (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide  (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),  perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur  hexafluoride (SF 6 ) and nitrogen  trifluoride (NF 3 ) Focus on Reducing Scope 2  Emissions Our efforts on reduction of GHG  emissions are centred mainly around  Scope 2 emissions mitigation, since  the major source of emissions at  APSEZ is electricity consumption,  which is categorised as Scope 2  emissions. We strive to reduce these  Scope 2 emissions by integrating  renewable energy (RE) sources and  increasing the RE proportion in our  power generation with the aim to  reduce the overall direct emissions  produced by our operations.  In terms of Scope 1 emissions, we  are working towards their reduction  by transitioning our operations to  electric power and implementing  energy efficiency measures. c)   Greenhouse Gas Emissions 158 159 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED 

We have successfully achieved emissions levels well below our  targeted amounts for the fiscal year 2024-25. In FY 2024-25, our emissions intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2 was  significantly lower than the previous year.  Scope 1   (metric  tonnes   CO 2 e) Scope 2   (metric  tonnes   CO 2 e) Scope 3   (metric  tonnes   CO 2 e) Target FY 2024-25   1,65,000 3,30,000 20,50,000 Our growing volume of business led to an increase in our absolute emissions  but the emission intensity per unit of revenue witnessed a slight decrease  in FY 2024-25. 32% Share of Scope 1 emissions in  total Scope 1 + 2 emissions  {Key sources – fossil fuels  like diesel, natural gas, and  furnace oil   (residual fuel oil) use in the  equipment and vehicles  owned by   us} We are continuously striving to reduce our Scope 1 emissions through use of alternative fuels, electrification,  and enhancement in the energy efficiency of our operations.

d)   Energy Performance At APSEZ, we have prioritised  effective energy management to  steer our climate change strategy.  The contribution of energy  consumption to the greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions underscores  the importance of optimal energy  usage. Further, in view of the  significant impact of energy  expenditures on our operational  costs, we realise the importance of  efficient energy management for  ensuring cost-effectiveness. All our  operating ports and our two joint  ventures (AICTPL and ACMTPL) are  certified with Energy Management  System (ISO 50001:2018).    Our efforts are geared towards  consistent reduction in our  energy consumption intensity.  We ensure precise monitoring  and management of energy use  by employing a comprehensive  system for data collection and  analysis for predefined energy  consumption KPIs. This helps in  the identification and rectification  of irregularities across all sites    To promote energy optimisation,  we also undertake regular  energy audits, setting of  quantified energy saving targets,  implementation of reduction  actions, continuous evaluation  of progress, utilisation of clean  energy, investment in innovative  technologies to decrease energy  consumption, and training of  employees on energy efficiency    An annual surveillance audit  is conducted at APSEZ under  Energy Management System  (ISO 50001:2018) to assess  the progress made against  the various objectives and  targets on energy consumption,  determine the areas of significant  energy use, and identify the  opportunities for improvement in  energy performance Our energy management initiatives  are focussed on:    Developing and enhancing  our operational energy (RE)  conservation capacity    Exploring new initiatives to  harness renewable energy  sources for boosting our ability  to minimise the environmental  impacts of our business    Bolstering our operational energy  conservation capabilities    Finding new and impactful ways  to increase utilisation of RE  sources in our operations Besides being imperative for  our climate change agenda,  these measures are important  for controlling our operational  costs. Our energy management  initiatives over the last few years  have led to a constant decline in  our energy consumption intensity.  Continuous monitoring of the  energy consumption KPIs across our  sites ensures sustained progress  on this count. We deploy a process  of systematic data collection and  analysis in energy consumption to  track the key KPIs. Energy Management Strategy  At APSEZ, we have adopted a multi-pronged energy management strategy, centred around:  Spreading  awareness and  implementing  strict monitoring  measures to  boost the energy  efficiency of our  operations Adoption of  advanced, new  technologies Use of alternative  fuels to minimise  carbon footprint Electrification of  equipment and  machines In FY 2024-25 the total energy consumption at APSEZ stood at 3,790 TJ, which was 10% more than  FY   2024-25. This was due to the addition of the Vizhinjam, Gopalpur and Tanzania ports. However, the  energy intensity of our operations saw a decline from 122 GJ/crore to 117 GJ/crore.  In line with our sustainability goals,  we have set a target to reach 100%  of total electricity consumption  from renewable energy sources by  2025. In FY 2024-25, we achieved  a notable 16% of RE consumption,  underscoring our commitment to  the realisation of our ambitious  target, which reflects our  determination to reduce our carbon  footprint, promote clean energy  practices, and contribute to a more  sustainable future. Note:  100% data coverage Our energy consumption increased  marginally by 10% in FY 2024-25. Note:  Additional sites Vizhinjam,  Gopalpur and Tanzania ports.

Robust biodiversity risk assessment  As part of our sustainability thrust, we take care to address risks related to biodiversity and ecosystems, alongside  critical areas such as climate change, waste, water, and community relations. We have put in place a comprehensive  risk management strategy that encompasses the unique challenges presented by coastal and marine ecosystems.  We have adopted a structured and meticulous approach for mitigating various nature-related risks. Frameworks & Standards  Guiding Our Biodiversity Risk  Assessment By complying stringently with  various risk related frameworks  and best practices, and integrating  them into our multi-disciplinary  company-wide risk management  processes, we ensure effective  risk assessment at APSEZ. The key  frameworks and standards include:    Local and National Regulations:  Cover all relevant environmental  and social laws, regulations,  policies and guidelines, at  national, state and local levels    International Best Practices  and Guidelines:  Include  globally recognised standards,  including the IFC Performance  Standards on Environmental  & Social Sustainability (2012)  and the World Bank Group  Environmental, Health, and Safety  (EHS) Guidelines    Sector-Specific Guidelines:  Encompass General EHS  Guidelines (2007), along with  sector-specific guidance for Ports,  Harbours, and Terminals (2017),  and Shipping (2007) Biodiversity Risk Assessment  Scope  In identifying the scope of our  biodiversity risk assessment, we  follow a comprehensive approach,  covering the potential impacts  of our operations on biodiversity  within the immediate vicinity of  our ports and those influenced  by our upstream and downstream  activities, and at our direct  operation sites. This enables us to  identify and address risks triggered  by activities like infrastructure  construction, dredging, shipping  activities, and land use changes.  Risk Identified:  Based on our broad  perspective and strategy, we have  identified the following risks:    Upstream Operations -  habitat  disturbance, introduction of  invasive species    Direct Operations -  pollution  risks from oil spills and chemical  discharges, alterations to  natural water flow    Downstream Operations -  noise  and vibrations that impact marine  life due to movement of vessels Biodiversity Risk Assessment Process  Stage 1 Preliminary Biodiversity Risk Screening Stage 2 Detailed Biodiversity Impact Assessment Stage 3 Formulation of Biodiversity Management Plans    Meticulous screening process at the start of  project to identify potential impacts on biodiversity,  particularly in areas of ecological sensitivity    Leveraging of Integrated Biodiversity Assessment  Tool (IBAT) for business   y Referencing of wide array of databases,  including the ENVIS Centre on Wildlife  and Protected Areas, the IUCN Red List of  Threatened Species, Birdlife Data Zone,  ebird.org, and databases from Conservation  International and the Critical Ecosystem  Partnership Fund, among others    Comprehensive assessment of  potential biodiversity impacts.    y Details provided in our  Environmental Impact  Statement (EIS) or  Environmental Impact  Assessment (EIA) reports,  which conform to a suite of  legislative requirements and  international guidelines and  include contributions from  experts and the public   y Assessment leverages the  Ecosystem Service Matrix (ESM)  to identify dependency-related  biodiversity risks to ecosystems,  within and adjacent  to project sites   y This process helps us acquire  an in-depth understanding  of the direct effects of our  operations on biodiversity and  the surrounding ecosystem During Construction of  Terminals    Increased sediment load and  potential changes in water quality  resulting from suspended solids,  altered dissolved oxygen levels,  and biochemical oxygen demand    Conceivable effects of the mix  of hydrocarbons and chemicals  on water bodies, impacting  aquatic ecology    Impact on aquatic fauna  as a result of underwater  noise increase risk    Potential disruptions to benthic  habitats and marine life on  account of bioaccumulation of  toxic materials During Port Operations    Impact on water bodies  from increased organic load,  potentially affecting water quality  and aquatic life    Risks to marine ecology as a  result of untreated wastewater  discharge, runoff, and  vessel movement   y Identifying location-specific key species  and biodiversity-rich areas that could be  impacted by our projects    Assessment of the ecosystem services  within and around the project area, such  as erosion control and pollution mitigation,  to fully understand the environmental  dynamics at play. This is done through the  Ecosystem Service Matrix (ESM) analysis Identified Impact-Related Biodiversity Risks    Formulation of location-specific Biodiversity Management Plans for Mundra, Dhamra, Hazira and Vizhinjam,  as part of our Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) reports, based on screening and risk  assessment.

Stage 4 Ongoing Monitoring of Value Chains and Stewardship    Regular monitoring and mitigation of indirect impacts in our upstream activities    Includes evaluation of marine biodiversity, hydrodynamic changes, shoreline erosion study,  and water quality    Proactive diligent monitoring and integrated biodiversity management plans in place to  ensure sustainability of our operations and protection of marine ecosystems Risk Mitigation Hierarchy  A risk mitigation hierarchy is followed for all new projects, with focus on avoiding, reducing, regenerating,  restoring and transforming negative impacts through various strategic initiatives. Reserve Areas to Restore & Regenerate Refers to allocation of specific areas at all operational sites for indigenous vegetation, in line with our  committment to the restoration and regeneration of biodiversity. Example : We have collaborated with the Gujarat Ecology Society (GES) for the restoration of natural  grassland habitats (Ecological Restoration) along the Guneri village, covering 40 Ha. of grassland in  Gauchar land. Transform/0ffset Refers to ensuring adequate compensation for any residual impacts by creating or enhancing biodiversity  elsewhere. We strive to achieve no net loss of biodiversity and adopt compensatory measures for  unavoidable impacts. Example:  Replacement of biodiversity loss/damage at one location is undertaken at another location. Reduce at Source Refers to measures taken to minimise negative impacts where they cannot be completely avoided.  This includes implementing technologies to reduce pollution, and creating buffer zones to protect nearby  ecosystems. Care is also taken to implement design improvements and measures such as pollution  control and sea traffic management to minimise adverse impacts. Example:  A ship tranquillity study assesses the harbour’s calmness and stability to ensure safe and  efficient port operations and take control measures, if required. This has been done for all the operational  ports of APSEZ.  Refers to planning and designing of all new port projects in ways that avoid negative impacts on  biodiversity. Process includes selection of locations that are not critical habitats for endangered species,  and scheduling of construction activities to avoid sensitive periods like breeding seasons.  Example:  The outcome of biodiversity risk screening is considered when deciding on the location and  design of ports, related infrastructure, and operations. The recently operational Vizhinjam International  Seaport Limited (VISL) Port does not impact mangroves or sensitive marine ecosystems due to its carefully  chosen strategic location and design. Avoid at Source Biodiversity management plan to  minimise ecological footprint Protection of biological diversity and its sustainable utilisation within our operational sites is a key priority at  APSEZ. Efforts in this direction are propelled by an integrated strategic approach, implemented through the  Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP), which is the mainstay of our commitment to environmental stewardship and  sustainable development. The BMP lists out the various measures we undertake to minimise our ecological footprint  while nurturing the health, resilience and diversity of ecosystems. The BMP seeks to harmonise the operational activities at APSEZ with biodiversity conservation. It ensures stringent  compliance by the company with the regulatory requirements, along with positive contribution to global and local  biodiversity goals. It drives our aspiration to lead by example, showcasing our efforts to synergise sustainable  operational practices with the conservation and enhancement of the ecosystem. Key Elements   of BMP  Formulation of strategies  to prevent, control, or  eradicate invasive species  that threaten local  biodiversity. Invasive Species  Management Implementation of restoration  projects, such as the Guneri  Restoration initiative, to  rehabilitate degraded ecosystems  and promote the recovery of  native species and habitats. Habitat    Restoration Adoption of a systematic approach  to monitor biodiversity, assess  the effectiveness of conservation  measures, and adapt management  strategies based on observed  outcomes. Monitoring and   Evaluation Collaboration with local  communities, stakeholders and  conservation organisations, to  integrate traditional knowledge  and practices in biodiversity  conservation efforts. Community Engagement   and Participation Identification and protection of  critical habitats, species, and  ecosystems within and around  our operational sites, to maintain  and enhance biodiversity. Conservation of Species  and Ecosystems Promotion of practices  that ensure the sustainable  use of natural resources,  thus reducing the negative  impacts on biodiversity and  ecosystem services.

Oil spill prevention and management  We have put in place a robust Oil  Spill Action Plan to prevent and  quickly mitigate any hazardous  substance spills that pose a  notable threat to the environment.  The meticulously designed plan  aligns with both the National Oil  Spill Disaster Contingency Plan  (NOS-DCP) and the standards set  by the International Petroleum  Industry Environmental  Conservation Association.  This ensures compliance with global  best practices in spill management. The oil spill contingency plan is:    Designed to handle Tier-1 level  oil spills, considering various  accident scenarios and identifying  vulnerable areas with a prepared  mitigation plan    Regularly updated, keeping  in view the potential  threats and impacts A modelling study shows that a  700-tonne crude oil spill (Tier-I)  would spread over a 400-metre  radius within four hours. APSEZ is  equipped with world-class facilities  to combat such spills. These include  oil spill dispersants, absorbent pads,  a portable dispersant storage tank,  portable pumps, oil containment  boom, skimmer system, floating  storage tanks, fence boom  towing bridles, and towing lines.  These resources ensure effective  response and management during  shoreline clean-up operations and  emergencies. Comprehensive Coverage The plan is crafted to address various  potential spill scenarios during  anchoring, berthing, and cargo handling,  and covers a wide range of operational  activities that could lead to spills. Land Spill Management The plan includes specific strategies  for immediate spill control and onshore  clean-up, taking into account the fact  that spills can also occur on land with  detrimental effects on soil, habitats and  terrestrial life. Regular Maintenance and Inspection The plan includes a comprehensive list of  scheduled inspections and maintenance,  centred around preventive measures to  minimise the risk of spills. The integrity  and proper functioning of equipment and  containment systems is ensured as part  of this regime. Zero Spills Achievement In FY 2024-25, APSEZ successfully  achieved zero spills, underscoring the  effectiveness of its spill prevention and  response strategies. Key Aspects of the  Oil Spill Action Plan Our 7   Point Oil Spill  Action Plan  Utilise leak-proof containers for the transport of  waste materials. Ensure secure storage of hazardous waste in  closed containers. Provide first-aid kits for immediate response to  minor injuries that may occur during handling.

Grade and compensation  structures are considered, with  focus on maintaining synergies  between the acquiring and  acquired companies, as part of  the employment harmonisation  process. It is ensured that the  standard employment terms are  communicated and accepted across  the board, and compensation  packages are harmonised for both  payroll and non-payroll employees.

Succession Planning APSEZ takes care to apply a  well-defined succession planning  process to its most strategic and  critical roles. Systematic evaluation  of such roles is undertaken within  a well-structured framework, which  applies to all employees at the O1  level and higher, including the CEO.  To ensure proper execution of the  Succession Planning process:    We have in place a well-defined  accountability framework     We have developed a robust  responsibility matrix to oversee  the entire process and ensure  alignment with the organisation's  strategic goals The matrix helps APSEZ in ensuring  consistency and transparency  in the identification and  development of the company’s  future leaders. It specifies the  roles and responsibilities of the  senior management and the human  resources department.  The criticality of the positions  is suitably categorised after a  detailed evaluation by the HR Head  (Operating Unit / Corporate) & the  COO / the CEO / Business Head.  The categories are based on:  a)   Organisation’s ability to sustain  its business operations and avoid  any adverse effect it might face  as a result of such vacancy b)   Ease of availability and quality of  such resource/skills in the talent  market  c)   Contribution to the topline /  bottom-line in terms of Gross  Revenue, Net Profit and EBIDTA,  in absolute relative terms Another key factor taken into  account in the process of  identifying the critical positions in  the company’s business strategies  for next five years, with a review  every two years unless there are any  significant changes before that.

The ideas are  assessed based on their scope of influence, financial  impact, and contributions to process or safety  improvements. Employees are rewarded at different  levels, with the incentives ranging from  `  5,000 to  `  5,00,000, depending on the idea’s impact and  successful implementation. Bi-Annual Performance Evaluation APSEZ conducts a bi-annual performance evaluation to ensure a fair and transparent employee performance  assessment. A multi-tiered review process is followed, involving direct feedback from reporting managers  and oversight from higher departmental authorities. This enables a thorough assessment of each employee's  contributions. A four-tier rating scale is used to categorise employees as top, strong, good, or low performers.  This helps in identifying and rewarding excellence, and in providing a clear roadmap for improvement and  progression. The appraisal systems also cover compliance with codes of conduct, with any breach of the code of  conduct making the employee unsuitable for appraisal.  Performance Appraisal We conduct performance appraisals to evaluate employee contributions and align them with organisational goals.  These appraisals focus on assessing strengths, identifying areas for improvement, and setting future objectives to  enhance overall productivity and growth. Types of Performance Appraisals 'Anytime Anyone Feedback'       Helps  individuals  seek feedback about  themselves or provide  feedback about another  employee at any time       Enables employees and  their managers gain a  better understanding of  their work and performance  from those with whom  they work closely Individual Feedback Sessions A constructive feedback session  for an individual employee  follows the appraisal process.  It helps the company assess the  appraisal reports and promote an  open dialogue on the individual  performance metrics and future  aspirations. Besides ushering  greater transparency into  the expectations from the  employees, this helps strengthen  the employee-manager  relationship, enabling continuous  improvement and career  development. Management by  Objectives (MBO)    The collaborative  performance  management process  sets goals through  manager-employee  partnerships.  Annual strategic  planning identifies  priorities, expanded  into measurable  KPIs and projects. Multi-Dimensional  Performance  Appraisal    (360º feedback)    The 360-degree    review system  gathers feedback on  job-specific skills,  communication,  leadership, teamwork,  and interpersonal    skills, aiding in  understanding  employee  performance and  fostering individual    development Team-Based  Performance  Appraisal    Employee evaluation    based on    contributions    and collaborative  team behaviour helps  assess the impact of  teamwork on overall  organisational    performance. Agile Conversations    Mid-year reviews  ensure continuous  performance  dialogues, discussing  KRAs with  management and  sharing feedback.  This helps employees  address knowledge  gaps, re-evaluate  goals, and receive  ongoing support  from immediate  reporting officers. Diligent Evaluation for Promotion Employees at APSEZ have to undergo a diligent evaluation process to become eligible for promotion. This ensures  the integrity of the promotion process and promotes employee trust and loyalty. A series of assessments are  carried out for specific roles, with key evaluation areas covering psychometric testing, situational judgement  evaluations, case studies, behavioural event interviews, and role-playing exercises. We also arrange for third-party  audits, optimising Organisational Citizenship Behaviour and enhancing productivity. Every decision on employee  promotion is driven by a detailed review of the assessment results, considering the individual performance scores,  the requirements of the position, and the availability of vacancies.  100% of employees receiving  performance appraisal 217 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED 216 

Performance-Linked Compensation Framework To promote meritocracy and a culture of equal pay, a structured, performance-linked compensation  framework is in place at APSEZ. Employee achievements are recognised and rewarded at all management  levels through this framework. This helps promote a high-performance environment in alignment with the  company’s strategic goals. Performance-Linked Compensation Structure A tiered performance-linked compensation structured has been adopted at APSEZ, based on the grades of  the employees. Under this structure, a significant portion of the Total Cost to Company (CTC) is allocated  as performance-based incentives: O1 to E1 Grades Employees in these grades  get performance-based  incentive amounting to  10% of their CTC. E2 to E4 Grades The performance-based  incentive for these  employees stands at 15% of  their CTC. GM and Above At the General Manager level  and above, the performance  pay is calculated on the basis  of both organisational and  individual performance metrics,  including contributions towards  ESG objectives. Performance Pay at APSEZ 30% 70% Individual Performance (70%)    Covers individual goal and    ESG performance. Organisation Performance (30%) Measured in terms of business    goals and financial performance,    with a weightage of 50% on   revenue, 25% on EBITDA,    and 25% on Return on    Capital Employed (RoCE). ESG-Linked Performance Given its commitment to  sustainable business practices  and workplace safety, APSEZ has  strategically linked executive  compensation with ESG  performance. The evaluation  metrics include compliance with  the Code of Conduct, Human  Rights, Financial and Operational  targets, Risk Management, IT,  Cyber Security, and Customer  Satisfaction. The linkage  underscores the company’s  commitment to responsible  business conduct and stakeholder  well-being. Equal Pay Commitment The company deploys uniform  performance evaluation and  compensation criteria for all  employees, regardless of gender,  with the objective of ensuring  an equal-opportunity workplace.  It stringently follows a policy of  equal pay for equal work, and  conducts periodic reviews of its  compensation structure to maintain  gender pay equity. The Nomination  and Remuneration Committee  (NRC) recommends to the Board  the remuneration of the Executive  Directors, including the CEO,  based on criteria such as industry  benchmarks, the company’s  performance vis-à-vis the industry,  Tobin’s Q, responsibilities shouldered,  and performance/track record. CEO’s Compensation Structure  The compensation structure for the  Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has  three components: a fixed salary,  a variable pays, and a long-term  incentive. This remuneration aligns  well with the business size and  complexity. The variable pay and  long-term incentive are linked to  both financial and ESG indicators,  which include Total Shareholder  Return, Revenue, EBITDA, ROCE,  Health & Safety metrics, Human  Rights parameters, Energy Intensity,  GHG Intensity, Water Intensity,  Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL), and  Mangrove Afforestation. The NRC  recommends the remuneration of  the Executive Directors to the Board  of Directors for approval. A 4-point scale is deployed  within the Performance  Management System at APSEZ  to calculate the performance  pay. The scale is designed  to accurately reflect the  individual’s contributions  in calculating the pay.  The performance pay structure  makes qualitative adjustments  based on ESG performance and  safety considerations in the  case of senior management  personnel, in line with APSEZ’s  commitment to sustainable  business practices.

Human rights  Protecting  human  rights  Protection of Human Rights is a key priority  across APSEZ. In line with the Adani Group's  vision of "Growth with Goodness" and to ensure  business sustainability, we strive to enhance the  living standards of the people in the areas of  our operations. We are aware of the impact of  incidents of Human Rights abuses on the Company.  To this effect, we take stringent care to ensure  the well-being of our employees and workers.  Maintaining fair working conditions, upholding  their rights, and ethical business conduct is pivotal  to our people strategy. Our business operations  have, till date, not  adversely affected any  indigenous communities,  nor have we found any  such communities within  our operational areas.  This underscores our  respect for the rights  and cultural heritage of  indigenous people.  The Adani Group follows a detailed  Human Rights Policy, along with  stringent guidelines, to uphold  Human Rights. These policies  underscore our commitment  to safeguarding the Human  Rights across our operations.  They function as a framework to  guide our employees and businesses  in ensuring total alignment with  the highest standards of integrity  and ethical conduct. They cover  our interactions with both internal  and external stakeholders, ensuring  that no divergence takes place  in terms of the guidelines and  policy   provisions. We have carefully aligned our  Human Rights Guidelines  to the  United Nations Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights  and the International Labour  Organisation's Declaration on  Fundamental Principles and Rights  at Work. This ensures not only  the protection of Human Rights  for all employees but also across  our stakeholder groups, value  chains, and partners, endorsing  our strong commitment to ethical  business practices and respect for  human   dignity.

Strategic Approach to Human Rights We have formulated a well-defined Human Rights strategy, which, like our Human Rights Guidelines, is completely  aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and International Labour  Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Setting equally high standards for our  suppliers and business partners, we expect them to adopt similar standards in HR policies and management. Our Human Rights strategy is designed to ensure stringent compliance with the local and international laws, as well  as our internal Human Rights policies. We expeditiously address and mitigate/correct any non-compliance issue.  The strategy is focussed on: We identify, prevent, mitigate  and respond to any potential  impacts on Human Rights in our  business operations through a  comprehensive due diligence  process. The process involves  identification and assessment  of Human Rights related risks  across own operations, value chain  operations, and new partnerships  such as mergers, acquisitions and  joint ventures. The process covers the entire  span of our employees, workers,  suppliers, consumers and  communities. In the pre-merger  and acquisition stage, the process  covers multiple attributes, including  the country’s reputation and  ongoing controversies pertaining  to Human Rights such as child  labour/forced labour/bonded labour,  diversity, human trafficking, equal  remuneration, sexual exploitation,  racial/gender discrimination etc.  APSEZ’s Corporate Responsibility  Committee, Corporate Social  Responsibility Committee, and  Stakeholders' Relationship  Committee have been mandated  with the task of overseeing the  integration of policy commitment.  These committees are also  responsible for ensuring the  alignment of material ESG aspects,  including Human Rights, with the  business strategy. A systematic risk management  process enables effective risk  management at APSEZ.     Enterprise Risk Management  (ERM) framework integrates  both top-down and bottom-up  approaches. The bottom-up  approach includes identification  of risks by the employees, based  on their circle of competence, and  development of risk mitigation/ prevention strategies by the  senior management with the  Board’s approval. The top-down  approach involves senior  management setting the risk  appetite, defining risk policies,  and ensuring alignment with  the organisation's strategic  objectives. Mitigation measures  are implemented by the  functional teams at the site  level, with oversight from the  corporate team.     Systematic periodic review is  undertaken of the risk mapping to  identify potential Human Rights  issues. This helps us proactively  address and mitigate any risks,  ensuring that our operations  and supply chain uphold our  commitment to Human Rights.  We regularly update our risk  assessments, enabling us to  implement necessary and  timely measures to protect  workers' rights and maintain  high standards of safety and  well-being. For example, we have  implemented a security check-in  process at all our operational  sites to identify Human Rights  risks associated with child labour  and forced labour. The Risk Management Committee  identifies all potential issues,  and accordingly adapts our due  diligence approach to each  incident based on the nature of  the enquiry. Appropriate remedies  are formulated and stakeholder  engagements are undertaken to  implement the required corrective  actions in case of non-compliance.  Self-Assessment Questionnaires  (SAQs) help in assessing Human  Rights risks in a quantitative  manner, enabling the company to  further strengthen its internal due  diligence efforts. We conducted the Self-Assessment  Questionnaires (SAQs) for  employees, suppliers, customers  and the community. APSEZ reached  out to all its employees with the  Self-Assessment Questionnaires  survey to identify Human Rights  risks. Nearly 77% of the employees  participated in the survey. Comprehensive Human Rights Due Diligence Due Diligence for our Human  Rights Risk Assessments Conduct of initial SAQs,  internal audits Review of the results and  risk assessment by the Risk  Management Committee Conduct due diligence of  identified medium & high-risk  areas Approval of the necessary  actions and remediation  measures, to be implemented  by the Board Committee Implementation of corrective  action and remediation by the  functional team Monitoring and  communication of  identified   risks Heightened Due Diligence  A well-defined Heightened Due  Diligence process is in place  and is pursued in situations of  conflict and emerging Human  Rights issues for the community.  This is aligned to the company’s  neutral approach in case of a  conflict so that its activities  do not influence the conflict  dynamics in any manner. Integrated Human Rights Policies Human Rights principles are well integrated into our business operations, making them a central proposition of our  corporate culture. Due Diligence Processes Due diligence is maintained in the process of identification, prevention, mitigation and consideration of the Human  Rights impacts of our business operations and supply chain. Remedial Actions Quick and suitable remedies are adopted in the event of any Human Rights violations linked to our business  activities. Transparency in Communication Care is taken to ensure open and transparent communication with our stakeholders regarding our Human Rights  processes and actions. Stakeholder Engagement We engage closely and constructively with the employees, suppliers, local communities, governments, NGOs, and  other relevant stakeholders for the protection of Human Rights, upholding high standards in this regard. Human Rights Policy Effectiveness Monitoring Process  We follow a meticulous process to monitor the effectiveness of our Human Rights Policy. Procuring  Information from existing  grievance  mechanisms,  employee  surveys, internal  audits, etc. Measuring Human  Rights Indicators in terms of  percentage of  workforce trained on  the Human Rights,  number of complaints  and findings with  respect to violations  of Human Rights  policy, and number  of Human Rights  impact assessments  conducted. Fact-Finding done by Risk  Management  Committee,  which ensures  thorough  examination and  redressal of any  reported Human  Rights issues/ complaints. Preventive  & Corrective  Measures  including  preventive  strategies  implemented  to avoid Human  Rights violations  and corrective  actions taken  promptly in case  of violation. Review involving course  correction,  as needed, to  enhance Human  Rights protection  and compliance. 226 227 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED

Screening of Significant Suppliers Led by our focus on strengthening our supply chain and ensuring its resilience, we undertake a strategic  screening process to evaluate our suppliers on various metrics. Criteria for Screening Focus on suppliers that are  central to our operations and  generally irreplaceable due  to their unique offerings;  which incudes high-volume  suppliers, essential component  providers, and those in  monopolistic   positions. ESG Considerations Supplier evaluation on  their ESG performance,  including their past actions  and commitments towards  managing ESG risks; also  covers assessment of the  broader impacts associated  with potential risks, such as  environmental degradation,  social inequity, or governance  failures, that could arise from  the geographical, sectoral, or  commodity-specific contexts in  which they operate. Sustainability Risk Matrix Is applied for effective  categorisation of suppliers,  enabling nuanced assessment  of suppliers by assigning  ESG parameter evaluation  scores and grades; aids in  identifying suppliers that may  pose significant sustainability  risks or have outstanding  sustainability practices. Grade/Score Above 85% Between 60 and 85% Below 60% O Grade Low Risk Low Risk Low Risk B Grade Low Risk Medium Risk Medium Risk A Grade Low Risk High Risk High Risk  Suppliers are tiered for streamlined engagement, with Tier 1 receiving special attention. A dedicated team evaluates  potential suppliers based on ESG, HR, and techno-commercial criteria. Vendor onboarding is crucial for mitigating any concerns. Suppliers must adhere to APSEZ's Supplier Code  of Conduct and Sustainable Procurement Policy. They undergo screening based on quality, manpower, audit  experience, and compliance with environmental and social norms. APSEZ has established procurement guidelines aimed at reducing environmental and social impacts.

Protecting Data Privacy We have prioritised data protection and privacy at  APSEZ, not merely as a compliance requirement but as  a core value that drives our commitment to excellence  and integrity in all our operations. We are committed to  upholding the highest standards of data protection and  privacy. Our business model is built on a foundation of  trust, transparency, and ethical practices, ensuring that  all personal and sensitive information is handled with  the utmost care and confidentiality. Data Privacy Governance Our commitment to safeguarding the privacy and  security of the data of our various stakeholders is  unwavering. To uphold this commitment, we are in  the process of formulating a comprehensive Data  Privacy Policy, covering all individuals and entities  associated with the organisation, including but not  limiting to employees, contractors, partners, customers  and third-party vendors. The policy will help manage  personal and sensitive data responsibly. It will comply  with current regulations and will incorporate the global  best practices, underscoring our belief that privacy is a  fundamental right. We implement robust measures to protect Personally  Identifiable Information (PII), ensuring our processes  meet regulatory standards. We also encourage our  stakeholders, including customers and business  partners, to contact us via email or phone with any  questions about their personal data. These initiatives  are designed to promote transparency and open  communication regarding data collection and use. We have integrated a detailed privacy policy system  into our group-wide risk and compliance management  framework. This system ensures the protection of  stakeholders' privacy rights, regulatory compliance in  data handling practices, and effective risk mitigation  strategies. By embedding privacy policies throughout  the organisation, we prioritise data security, and build  trust with our customers and   partners. The Head - Cybersecurity is responsible for ensuring  compliance of the Privacy Policy at APSEZ. Strategy for Data Privacy Protection &  Risk   Mitigation Given the threat posed by data privacy issues to the  company’s integrity and operational continuity, we have  aligned our framework for data privacy risk assessment  with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act.  Our efforts are focussed on ensuring compliance with  legal requirements and industry best practices as per  the   Act. Detection Mechanisms    Monitoring Tools:  Intrusion Detection Systems  (IDS), Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, and  Security Information and Event Management  (SIEM) platforms are utilised to monitor  suspicious activities    Access Logs:  Access logs are regularly reviewed to  identify unauthorised access or anomalies    Incident Reporting Channels:  Employees are  trained to promptly report suspicious activities or  potential breaches to the cybersecurity team Reporting Procedures    Internal Reporting:  Potential breaches are  escalated to the Incident Response Team (IRT) for  further investigation and containment    Regulatory Reporting:  Timely notification to  regulatory authorities is ensured for confirmed  breaches involving personal data, as mandated by  data privacy regulations    Stakeholder Notification:  Detailed information  about the breach and the measures taken is  provided to affected individuals and stakeholders,  along with guidance on how they can  protect themselves Our Data Privacy Protocols  We have instituted a comprehensive privacy impact  assessment (PIA) for various projects at APSEZ.  The assessment is designed to evaluate how a  project, system or process affects the privacy of  individuals whose data is being collected, stored,  or processed. It ensures compliance with data  protection laws like the GDPR and DPDP Act, and  helps mitigate potential privacy risks. At APSEZ, we have established elaborate  mechanisms to detect and report data breaches  as part of our cybersecurity framework.  The framework is also being extended to include  privacy considerations. We employ a combination  of technical and procedural measures to ensure  timely detection and reporting of breaches. Key Steps in Conducting a PIA Determine if the project involves  high-risk data processing activities,  such as handling sensitive personal  information. Document the process of collection,  usage, storage, and sharing of the  collected. Assess potential risks to individuals'  privacy, including data breaches or  misuse. Engage with stakeholders, including  data subjects, to gather their input and  concerns. Identify measures to mitigate identified  risks, such as data encryption or access  controls. Record the findings and decisions  made during the assessment. Regularly review and update the PIA  to reflect changes in the project or  regulatory environment. Identify the  need for a  PIA Describe the  Information  Flows Identify  Privacy Risks Consult   Stakeholders Evaluate    Privacy  Solutions Document  the    PIA Review and    Update Data protection and information sharing practices We follow elaborate practices designed to ensure the  integrity and security of data sharing and protection. These include: Safe Data Storage Back-up and secure storage for 5 years for all essential  applications, including IPOS Container and IPOS  Non-Container systems; Protection and safe retention  for 7 years for all financial documents Controlled Information Sharing Adani Microsoft SharePoint Solution Information used  to enable sharing with third parties, when necessary;  Approvals needed for this from relevant business and  cybersecurity teams, ensuring compliance with strict  security protocols Seeking Consent Individual’s opt-in consent obtained, where required  under relevant Data Protection Laws, before processing  activities on customer data / personal information  are   undertaken Data Deletion Identification and secure deletion of  data that is no  longer needed, ensuring that it cannot be recovered.   Deletion process, including details of what was deleted   and when, clearly documented Data Anonymisation Data identified for anonymisation and for application  of techniques like generalisation, suppression, or  pseudonymisation, to protect privacy while retaining its  analytical value Purpose-Specific Data Usage Restriction on use of personal data of all stakeholders  to essential business operations, such as invoice  generation and payment processing. Such data includes  key identifiers like names, addresses, email, mobile  numbers, and financial details. All such data securely  blocked in the system after completion of process/ service Regulatory Compliance Strict regulation of disclosure of customer information  to third parties; Limited to legal obligations with  government agencies; May include sharing of specific  details, such as PAN and GST numbers, for tax  filing   purposes Privacy by Design Privacy-by-design principles being adopted to embed  data privacy into IT systems, in line with DPDP Act; To   include features like data minimisation, encryption, and  role-based access controls Protection of Personal Information Emphasis on protection of personal data or information  of all the stakeholders, including customers, employees,  third-party vendors, partners, suppliers, etc.; DPDP  Act 2023 acts as regulation on data privacy and  control; Our stakeholder data privacy measures include  authorisation, encryption, verification, data back-up  and recovery; We adopt the best business practices to  protect all private data, including restrictions on data  collection and access,  regular audits, employee training  on privacy practices, and regular reviews of compliance  with the data protection laws As a B2B enterprise, with our primary focus on  commercial activities rather than marketing, we don’t  necessitate an opt-out option for our customers  regarding the handling of their personal information.  In the broader context, given that the personal data  is predominantly used for commercial purposes, the  application of such data for secondary purposes is  not   relevant. 312 313 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED 

Compliance Robust data privacy incident  response management A robust Incident Response Plan  (IRP) is in place with respect to  cybersecurity & data privacy at  APSEZ. The plan ensures effective  management of data breaches  involving personal data and is  aligned with the organisation's  overall cybersecurity strategy as  well as the requirements of privacy  regulations like the DPDP Act. We are now in the process  of establishing dedicated  communication channels, such as  an email helpdesk  and a grievance  cell, to enable data principals  to seamlessly lodge complaints.  These mechanisms will be backed  by defined timelines to address  concerns efficiently. Training & Awareness Cyber Security  and Data Privacy  training and awareness help  employees identify and avoid  cyber threats, reducing the risk of  data breaches and cyberattacks.  These training fosters a culture  of security compliance, ensuring  that everyone in the organisation  understands their role in protecting  sensitive information and  maintaining regulatory standard. Key Topics of these trainings focus  on phishing awareness, password  best practices, and data protection.  Additionally, it cover safe internet  practice, Social Engineering ,  mobile device security, two-factor  authentication, and incident  reporting to ensure comprehensive  understanding and protection. The effectiveness of data privacy  and cybersecurity training is  measured through several methods: 1.   Pre- and Post-Training  Assessments:  Comparing  knowledge and skills before  and after training to gauge  improvement. 2.   Phishing Simulations:   Conducting simulated phishing  attacks to see how well  employees apply what they've  learned 3.   Employee Feedback:  Gathering  feedback from participants to  understand their perception  of the training's relevance and  effectiveness Maintaining Confidentiality We follow a zero-tolerance policy  against any violations to the  privacy policy.  We have embedded  the principle of confidentiality  of personal information into our  code of conduct. Any violation  of the privacy policy, or  involvement in privacy breaches,  by an employee invites strict  disciplinary action. We have an  excellent track record in terms  of customer privacy protection,  and have not reported any cases  of information security breaches,  data breaches, or cybersecurity  incidents in the past three fiscal  years. APSEZ has the distinction  of ZERO substantiated incidents  related to breach of customer  privacy, data theft, leaks, or loss  for FY 2024-25. This underlines  our strong commitment to data  protection and implementation of  cybersecurity measures. No fines  or penalties levied have been  imposed on APSEZ with respect  to data security breaches or  cybersecurity incidents.

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 367 Management Discussion & Analysis Global Economy The global economy showed remarkable strength in the  face of various challenges this past year. Despite ongoing  geopolitical tensions and a cost-of-living crisis affecting  many countries, it managed to remain resilient.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  the global growth rate is at 3.3% for 2024, fuelled by  strong private consumption and government spending,  particularly in the United States and many emerging  markets. Notably, the global infrastructure construction  market was valued at around USD 3.05 billion this year.  While the U.S. economy outperformed expectations, the  UK and Europe experienced a slowdown and narrowly  avoided falling into a recession. On the bright side, India  continued to shine, but China faced challenges due to a  slowdown in its property sector. Advanced Economies:  The United States saw a GDP  growth of 2.8% in 2024, an improvement from earlier  forecasts. This positive outlook is largely due to strong  labour markets and easing inflation. In contrast, the Euro  area grew at a slower rate of 0.9% in 2024, with a slight  decline in Germany. This reflects ongoing difficulties in  the industrial output and energy sectors. Emerging Markets and Developing Economies:  For China,  the GDP growth is at 5.0% in 2024, reinforced by fiscal  measures and a less severe slowdown in the real-estate  market. Overall, emerging markets and developing  economies are set to grow by 4.3% in 2024, driven by  increased investments in technology and infrastructure. Global Real GDP Growth 3.3 2.8 3.0 1.8 1.4 1.5 4.3 3.7 3.9 2025 (P)  2024 2026 (P) World Output Emerging Market and Developing Economies Advanced Economies (P) stands for projected numbers (in %) After peaking in mid-2022, headline inflation across  the globe started falling. However, core and services  disinflation remained slow. Central Banks of Advance  Economies kept their policy rates on hold as inflation is  yet to go below their tolerance levels. Global inflation decreased from 6.8% in 2023 to  5.9% in 2024, with a further decline to 4.5% in 2025.  Advanced economies saw an average inflation rate  of 2.6% in 2024, aligning with central bank's target by  2025. In contrast, emerging markets experienced higher  inflation rates, averaging 8.1% in 2024 and easing to 6%  in 2025.  (Source: World Economic Outlook, IMF (April 2024)) When it comes to monetary policy and interest rates,  major central banks, including the Federal Reserve,  European Central Bank, and Bank of England, are likely  to maintain current interest rates until the latter half  of 2024, followed by a gradual reduction. This strategy  aims to strike a balance between facilitating economic  growth and controlling inflation. In terms of oil prices, Brent crude oil average price  was around USD   80 per barrel in 2024, influenced  by geopolitical tensions and supply considerations.  Forecasts for 2025 suggest an average price of  USD  73 and USD 72 in 2026 per barrel, with non-OPEC  producers, particularly the United States, expected  to increase output, which could help stabilise prices.  (Source: capital.com) Coal prices have seen volatility due to the global  shift towards clean energy and changes in policy.  The growing adoption of renewable energy sources and  international climate commitments are affecting coal  demand and pricing, prompting a transition in energy  generation methods. Outlook Global economic growth is to reach 2.8% in  2025 and  then rise to 3.0% in 2026. This projection for 2025 is  largely influenced by the strong performance of the  United States and several significant emerging markets.  In advanced economies, growth is anticipated to hold  steady at 1.4% and 1.5% in 2025 and 2026, respectively.  Specifically, in the United States, growth is forecasted  at 1.8% in 2025 before slowing to 1.7% in 2026, as the  labour market cools and consumption growth moderates.  Meanwhile, the Euro area is expected to rebound from its  low, with growth rates forecasted at 0.8% in 2025 and  1.2% in 2026, driven by stronger household consumption  and falling inflation. 

368 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED The global infrastructure construction sector is projected  to grow by USD   3.20 billion in 2025 and reach around  USD   4.96 billion by 2034, growing at a compound annual  growth rate (CAGR) of 5.0% during the forecast period. The global economic outlook for 2025-26 presents a  mix of positive trends and notable risks. While global  headline inflation is projected to decline, with estimates  of 4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026, ongoing geopolitical  instability remains a significant concern. Conflicts and  trade disputes could disrupt global trade, impacting  economic stability. Additionally, the transition towards cleaner energy  sources pose challenges for resource-dependent  economies, which may struggle to adapt to the evolving  energy landscape. Furthermore, climate risks, including  unpredictable weather patterns, could adversely affect  agriculture and overall economic stability.  According to the WTO, global merchandise trade volume  rose by 2.9% in 2024 but is expected to decline by  0.2% due to trade policy uncertainty. It is projected  to rebound with a 2.5% increase in 2026 despite  weaker global demand. Indian Economy Against a challenging global backdrop, India stands out  as one of the fastest-growing major economies, driven by  strong domestic consumption, favourable demographics,  and increasing disposable incomes. The government's  strategic reforms, substantial investments in both  physical and digital infrastructure, and initiatives such as  ‘Make in India’ and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI)  scheme have been crucial in enhancing the country’s  growth, resilience, and self-reliance. According to the Second Advanced Estimate (SAE) data  published by the National Statistical Office (NSO),  a  sequential slowdown of real GDP has been observed,  achieving a rate of 6.5% in FY 2024-25, compared to  9.2% in FY   2023-24 as per the First Revised Estimate  which is considered to be the highest in previous 12  years except for FY    2021-22. This has been marked  by a broad-based recovery across industrial sectors,  particularly  in  manufacturing.  The  financial  services  sector in India has also played a pivotal role in driving  economic momentum. As a vital enabler of capital flow  and investment, this sector has witnessed significant  innovation  and  growth,  especially  in  fintech,  digital  banking, and inclusive finance. With the Reserve Bank  of India’s supportive regulatory framework and initiatives  aimed at promoting financial inclusion and literacy, the  financial services sector has shown sustained growth. High-frequency indicators, such as Goods and Services  Tax (GST) collections, reported significant growth during  FY 2024-25. Revenue collection from GST surged by  9.4%, reaching  `   22.09 lakh crore during the year under  review.   (Source: GST Portal) In FY 2024-25, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shifted  its monetary policy stance from a prolonged pause to an  accommodative approach, initiating rate cuts to bolster  economic growth amid easing inflationary pressures.  The central bank reduced the policy repo rate by a total  of 50 basis points, bringing it down to 6.0% through  two consecutive 25 basis point cuts in February and  April 2025.  (Source: Economic Times) This  policy  shift  was  underpinned  by  a  significant  moderation in inflation. Retail inflation, measured by the  Consumer Price Index (CPI), averaged 4.6% in FY 2024-25,  down from 5.4% in FY 2023-24 and 6.7% in FY 2022-23.  As of April 2025, CPI inflation eased to 3.16%, marking  the lowest level since July 2019 and remaining below the  RBI's 4% target for the third consecutive month.  (Source: Press Information Bureau) Wholesale inflation also exhibited a downward trend.  The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation declined sharply  to 0.85% in April 2025 from 2.05% in March, primarily  due to reductions in fuel and power prices. The WPI  Food Index inflation decreased from 4.66% in March to  2.55% in April 2025, indicating easing price pressures in  food items. The convergence of declining CPI and WPI  inflation has provided the RBI with additional room for  monetary easing.

This optimistic  outlook is driven by vigorous infrastructure investments,  strong capital expenditure from the private sector, and  a  growing  financial  services  industry.  With  ongoing  strategic reforms, India is in a strong position to  maintain sustainable long-term economic growth  and development. Several key elements contribute to this favourable  outlook. India is poised to harness its demographic  dividend,  benefit  from  increased  capital  expenditure,  and capitalise on proactive government policies.  Additionally, strong consumer demand and enhanced  rural  consumption  prospects  play  a  significant  role.  As headline inflation approaches target levels, an uptick  in rural consumption is anticipated. The government's  commitment to capital expenditure and fiscal discipline,  coupled with rising consumer and business confidence,  creates a positive environment for investment and  consumption. Initiatives such as ‘Make in India 2.0’,  improvements in the Ease of Doing Business, and the  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme are expected  to bolster infrastructure, enhance manufacturing  capabilities, boost exports, and position India as a global  manufacturing hub. As inflation trends towards target levels by 2025, it is likely  that the RBI will adopt more accommodative monetary  policies.  A  significant  emphasis  on  infrastructure,  supported by public initiatives, is projected to stimulate  gross  fixed  capital  formation.  Furthermore,  increased  rural demand, driven by government programmes like the  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), is  expected to further enhance consumption levels. Industry Overview Global Ports Global maritime trade is intrinsically linked to the world  economy, reflecting trends in GDP and merchandise  trade. Over the past decade, the trade-to-GDP ratio, which  gauges the responsiveness of trade to economic changes,  has declined steadily, with the disparity becoming more  pronounced since 2018. This trend is attributed to  rising trade protectionism, regionalisation, reshoring  of production, and the adoption of trade-restrictive  measures and industrial policies. Global maritime trade and world GDP 8 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 2006 GDP growth rate Seaborne  trade  growth  rate 2012 2018 2008 2014 2020 2010 2016 2022 2024 In 2024, global trade achieved a record of USD 33 trillion,  growing at an annual rate of 3.7%, according to UNCTAD.  Trade expansion was led by 9% growth in services and a  modest 2% rise in merchandise trade. Maritime Trade Volumes and Economic Influences Global maritime trade grew by 2%, in 2024 (to 12.53 billion  tonnes), building upon the 2.4% growth (12.3 billion  tonnes) observed in 2023. This recovery was supported  by global economic resilience, with GDP growth of 3.7%  defying predictions of a recession despite unprecedented  monetary tightening. While China’s recovery was slower  than expected, its economy played a crucial role in global  growth, alongside the United States, which avoided an  anticipated downturn.

370 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED added volatility to the maritime trade landscape.  Despite these headwinds, seaborne trade growth  in tonne-miles outpaced tonnage growth driven by  longer-haul voyages. Long-Term Growth and Challenges UNCTAD forecasts global maritime trade to expand by 2%  in 2024 and an average of 2.4% annually between 2025  and 2029. This growth is underpinned by strong demand  for major bulk commodities like iron ore, coal, and grain,  alongside containerised goods. However, challenges such  as geopolitical tensions, extreme weather conditions,  and economic uncertainties and ongoing tariff war pose  significant short-term risks. Technological advancements, the transition to cleaner  energy, and infrastructure development are expected  to be critical drivers of growth in the longer term.  Drewry predicts containerised trade to shrink by 1%  in 2025, followed by moderate growth through 2029.  Despite oversupply concerns in the containership market,  improvements in port productivity and vessel scrapping  could mitigate this imbalance over time. Risks and Opportunities The global economy continues to face headwinds,  including persistent inflation, high borrowing costs,  and geopolitical complexities. Policy uncertainties  driven  by  elections,  fiscal  constraints,  and  trade  disputes further complicate the medium-term outlook.  However, opportunities lie in the expansion of green  energy  and  artificial  intelligence  sectors,  alongside  potential interest rate cuts in major economies that  could stimulate trade. Balancing immediate priorities  with sustainability and resilience will be essential to  nurturing stable growth in maritime trade. Policy Implications To safeguard global maritime trade amidst these  challenges, UNCTAD’s 2024 Review of Maritime Transport  underscores the importance of a comprehensive policy  framework. Key recommendations include:    Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience:  Investing in  infrastructure and technology, diversifying supply  sources, and reducing dependence on critical  chokepoints to prepare for disruptions    Promoting International Cooperation:  Strengthening  trade agreements and encouraging regional and  South–South trade to mitigate geopolitical risks and  ensure smoother trade flows    Sustainable Practices:  Advancing green technologies  and sustainable operations to align with environmental  goals and unlock new trade opportunities    Adapting to Market Trends:  Regularly monitoring trade  patterns, alternative supply sources, and the impact of  disruptions to maintain long-term stability and growth India’s EXIM Trade The EXIM Trade of India experienced modest growth in  FY   2024-25, primarily influenced by the low prices of crude  oil. Merchandise exports remained nearly at FY   2023-24  levels due to reduced volume and lower unit realisation in  petroleum products. Meanwhile, imports in FY 2024-25  increased by over 6%. In FY   2025-26, the volume of  crude and POL segments is expected to increase, but  their value may decrease due to low prices and higher  output. Gold imports are anticipated to decline following  the high base of FY   2024-25. Overall, merchandise  imports are projected to grow moderately in value terms  in FY   2025-26. Merchandise exports are expected  to grow faster than imports, largely driven by the  non-POL segment. India plays a significant role in global trade, with its  export-import (EXIM) activities shaped by a diverse  mix of commodities, key trading partners, and evolving  policy measures. Merchandise exports are a crucial  source of foreign exchange earnings, with engineering  goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery, and  pharmaceuticals being leading export categories.  On the import side, crude oil, electronic goods, gold,  and machinery constitute a significant share, reflecting  domestic demand patterns and industrial requirements.  All these factors contributes towards India's rising share  in global merchandise trade which, according to the WTO,  stands at 2.2% in exports and 3.4% in imports (excluding  intra-EU trade). The country’s trade patterns are influenced by shifts in  global demand, currency fluctuations, trade agreements,  and geopolitical developments. Ports serve as the  backbone of India’s EXIM trade, handling a substantial  share of the country’s cargo movements. With its  strategic location and world-class infrastructure, APSEZ  plays a vital role in facilitating seamless trade flows,  supporting India’s integration into global supply chains.  The efficiency of cargo handling, turnaround times, and  multimodal connectivity are key determinants of India’s  trade competitiveness, positioning APSEZ as a crucial  enabler of export growth. India’s EXIM trade is also shaped by government policies  such as the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP), Production-Linked  Incentive (PLI) schemes, and tariff structures that  impact cost dynamics and export competitiveness.  Additionally, trade relations with key partners like the US,  the European Union, China, and Southeast Asia drive the  volume and composition of India’s external trade. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 371 This growth in India’s exports can be attributed to the  country’s ongoing economic activity, supported by  momentum in both manufacturing and services sectors.  Additionally, improving demand from trading partners,  along with anticipated global monetary easing, is likely  to support this growth. However, various risks such as  global uncertainties in certain advanced and emerging  economies, geoeconomic fragmentation, crises in the  Middle East and West Asia, possible intensification of  protectionist policies, and disruptions in global supply  chains could impact the outlook.

Additionally, APSEZL has established  key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets for supply chain management sustainability that apply to Tier  1 suppliers. These suppliers are deemed highly dependent, as they are the direct vendors with whom the  Company engages in large volume transactions.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end  of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.     Being a service provider company, APSEZL doesn’t have any products to reclaim for re-use and recycle.  However, the Company complies with all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to waste management.  The C ompany has defined processes in place for managing waste at each of its operational sites/locations.      Plastic  Waste:  As per the statutory guidelines, for obtaining Environmental Clearance (EC) from MoEF&CC,  we are required to have Single Use Plastic (SUP) free ports. Accordingly, all our operating ports are SUP free.  Other than SUP, plastic waste is being disposed to authorized vendors for reuse and recycle appropriately.      E-waste:  All e-waste generated in-house is handed over to certified vendors for safe disposal.     Hazardous waste:  Hazardous waste is handled, segregated, stored, and transported in accordance with applicable  regulatory requirements and best industry practices. Hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally  sound manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation. Hazardous waste (chemicals,  sludge, oil etc.) collected from incoming vessels are channelized through a separate line, which is handed over to  authorized third-party dealers.      Other  Waste:  APSE ZL has initiated ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ (ZWL) initiative for non-hazardous waste as we are  committed towards responsible waste disposal practices, and we have implemented the 5R approach (Reduce,  Reuse, Recycle, Recover, and Reprocess) across all our facilities. As part of the ZWL initiative Mundra, Kattupalli,  Ennore, Dhamra, Goa, and Tuna sites have achieved Zero Waste to Landfill certification. Essential measures taken  towards effective waste management are:    i.     We have implemented a sustainable waste management practice by recycling bio-degradable waste and  using it as manure.    ii.   Non-biodegradable waste such as paper, plastic, and scrap is sent to recyclers.    iii.     Non-recyclable and non-recoverable dry waste (loose refused derived fuel) was sent to cement plants for  co-processing.    iv.   STP sludge was used as a soil conditioner/manure.   v.     Under the International Maritime Organization’s MARPOL 73/78 convention, vessels that call at our port  deliver their waste safely to our facility at a nominal charge, in alignment with the ‘polluter pays’ principle’.    vi.     We continuously impart training to our employees on responsible waste disposal practices to ensure that  they are aware of their roles in implementing sustainable waste management practices. In addition, we work  with our customers to manage their waste through appropriate channels.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy  adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes  and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.     APSEZL, being in the service industry (i.e., provides services for cargo handling & logistics, operations &  maintenance of port sector) does not produce any products using hazardous and toxic chemicals. As such,  we don’t have potential to recycle generated waste in our operations. However, APSEZL complies with all the  applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to waste management. Achieving Zero Waste to Landfill at all our  sites by FY 2024-25 is an ambitious sustainability goal that aims to divert all waste from landfills and eliminate  the need for traditional waste disposal practices.     We dispose of our waste in an environmentally friendly manner through CPCB / SPCB registered CHWIF/ TSDF or  authorized recyclers. As we move towards our vision of Zero Waste to landfill at all sites, several initiatives have  been implemented in the handling and management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at all operating  port locations by focusing on 5R principles of waste management i.e., Reduce, Reuse, Reprocess, Recycle and  Recover. Essential measures we take towards effective waste management:   a.     We have implemented a sustainable waste management practice by recycling bio-degradable waste and  using it as manure.   b.   Non-biodegradable waste such as paper, plastic, and scrap are sent to recyclers.    c.     Non-recyclable and non-recoverable dry waste (loose refused derived fuel) was sent to cement plants for  co-processing.    d.   STP sludge was used as soil conditioner/manure.   e.     APSEZL has successfully accomplished its objective of establishing a single-use plastic-free port across its  sites as part of its commitment to the 5R’s principle.    f.     We continuously educate and train our employees on responsible waste disposal practices to ensure that  they are aware of their roles in implementing sustainable waste management practices.

The  value  in  use  of  the  underlying  businesses is determined based on the discounted  cash  flow  projections.  Significant  judgements  are  required to determine the key assumptions used in  the discounted cash flow models, such as discount  rate, growth rate and future operating and finance  cost based on management’s view of future business  prospects. Considering the materiality of the amount involved,  and  significant  management  judgement  required  for  valuation,  Impairment  of  investments  in  and  loans granted to subsidiaries and joint ventures has  determined to be a key audit matter in the current  year audit.

We also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section  143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for  expressing our opinion on whether the company has  adequate internal financial controls with reference  to standalone financial statements in place and the  operating effectiveness of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates and related disclosures made by  management and Board of Directors. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of management  and Board of Director’s use of the going concern  basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty  exists related to events or conditions that may  cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern. If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required to  draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related  disclosures in the standalone financial statements  or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our  opinion.  Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report.  However,  future  events  or  conditions  may cause the Company to cease to continue as  a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content  of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  standalone  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. •   Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  statements/financial  information of the branch which is included in the  Company to express an opinion on the standalone  financial  statements.  We  are  responsible  for  the  direction, supervision and performance of the audit  of financial information of such branch included in  the standalone financial statements of which we  are the independent auditors. For the other branch  included  in  the  standalone  financial  statements,  which have been audited by other auditor, such  other auditors remain responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audits carried  out  by  them.  We  remain  solely  responsible  for  our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

We describe  these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter  or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine  that a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial control with reference  to  standalone  financial  statements  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially  adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in accounting policy as mentioned in  note 2.2 (w) hitherto in use.     The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and  liabilities which have been measured at fair value or revalued amount:    Derivative financial instruments,    Defined Benefit Plans – Plan Assets measured at fair value; and      Certain  financial  assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  (refer  accounting  policy  regarding  financial instruments).     In addition, the financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( ` ) in crore and all values are rounded off to  two decimal ( `  00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated. 2.2   Summary of material accounting policies   a)   Current versus non-current classification       The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification.  An asset is treated as current when it is:    Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle; or    Held primarily for the purpose of trading; or    Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or    Cash and cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least  twelve months after the reporting period      All other assets are classified as non-current.     A liability is classified as current when:    It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle; or    It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or    It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or    There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting period.     The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities respectively.       The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash  or cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle. 

510 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   b)   Foreign currency transactions :       The Company’s financial statements are presented in INR, which is functional currency of the Company.  The Company determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements are  measured using that functional currency.     Transactions and balances       Transactions   in   foreign   currencies   are   recorded   at   the   exchange   rate   prevailing   on   the   date   of   transaction.  However, for practical reasons, the Company uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual  rate at the date of transaction.       Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency  spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.       Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using  the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.   c)   Fair value measurement     The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.       Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on  the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:    In the principal market for the asset or liability, or    In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability     The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.       The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use  when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.       A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to  generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market  participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.       The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient  data is available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the  use of unobservable inputs.       All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are  categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is  significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:    Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities    Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is directly or indirectly observable    Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is unobservable       For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company  determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization  (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 511 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       The  Company's  Management  determines  the  policies  and  procedures  for  both  recurring  fair  value  measurement, such as derivative financial instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value  and for non recurring fair value measurement, such as an assets under the scheme of business undertaking.       External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as business undertaking for transfer  under the scheme and unquoted financial assets and financial liabilities. Involvement of external valuers  is decided upon annually by the Management and in specific cases after discussion with and approval by  the Company's Audit Committee. Selection criteria includes market knowledge, reputation, independence  and whether professional standards are maintained. The Management decides, after discussions with the  Company’s external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.       At each reporting date, the Management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which  are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Company’s accounting policies. For this analysis,  the Management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the  valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.       The Management, in conjunction with the Company’s external valuers, also compares the change in the fair  value of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.       For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the  basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy  as explained above.       This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the  relevant notes.    Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions (refer note 34.2 and 2.3)    Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy (refer note 34.2)    Investment in unquoted equity shares (refer note 4)    Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) (refer note 34.1)   d)   Revenue recognition       Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred  to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled  in exchange for those goods or services.     The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognized.     Port Operation Services       Revenue from port operation services including cargo handling, storage, rail infrastructure and other  ancillary port services are recognized in the accounting period in which the services are transferred to  the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in  exchange for those services.       In cases, where the contracts include multiple contract obligations, the transaction price will be allocated  to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling prices. Where these prices are not directly  observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin. Revenue recorded by the company is net  of variable consideration on account of various discounts offered by the Company as part of the contract.       Revenue on take-or-pay charges are recognized for the quantity that is the difference between annual  agreed tonnage and actual quantity of cargo handled. The amount recognized as revenue is exclusive of  goods & service tax where applicable. 

512 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Income in the nature of license fees / waterfront royalty and revenue share is recognized in accordance with  terms and conditions of relevant service agreement with customers/ sub concessionaire.       Income towards infrastructure premium is recognized as revenue in the year in which the Company provides  access to its common infrastructure.    Interest  income       For all financial assets measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive  income, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly  discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument  or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized  cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected  cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment,  extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is  included in other income in the statement of profit and loss.    Dividends       Revenue is recognized when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally  when shareholders approve the dividend.   e)   Government Grants       Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and  all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized  as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to  compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized either as an income in equal  amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset or by deducting grant in arriving at the carrying  amount of the assets.       Waterfront royalty on cargo under the concession agreement is paid at concessional rate in terms of rate  prescribed by Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) and notified in official gazette of Government of Gujarat,  wherever applicable.   f)   Exceptional Items       An item of income or expense which by its size, type or incidence requires disclosure in order to improve an  understanding of the performance of the Company is treated as an exceptional item and disclosed as such  in the financial statements.   g)   Taxes     Tax expense comprises of current income tax and deferred tax.     Current income tax       Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid  to the taxation authorities. Current income tax(including Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)) is measured at the  amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income-Tax Act, 1961 enacted in  India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially  enacted, at the reporting date.       Current income tax relating to items recognized outside the statement of profit and loss is recognized  outside  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  (either  in  other  comprehensive  income  (OCI)  or  in  equity).  Current tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in  equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in  which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 513 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025    Deferred  tax       Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet approach on temporary differences between the tax bases  of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.     Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:   y   When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a  transaction that (i) is not a business combination (ii) at the time of the transaction, affects neither the  accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and (iii) at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to  equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.       In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments In subsidiaries, associates and  interests in joint ventures, deferred tax is not recognised when the timing of the reversal of the temporary  differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the  foreseeable future.       Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax  credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that  taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of  unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:   y When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial  recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that (i) is not a business combination (ii) at the time  of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and (iii) at the time of  the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.       In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and  interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that  the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against  which the temporary differences can be utilised.       The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent  that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the  deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date  and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the  deferred tax asset to be recovered.       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when  the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or  substantively enacted at the reporting date.       Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside the statement of profit and loss is recognized outside  the statement of profit and loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are  recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.       The Company recognizes tax credits in the nature of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit as an asset only  to the extent that there is sufficient taxable temporary difference /convincing evidence that the Company  will pay normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed to  be carried forward. In the year in which the Company recognizes tax credits as an asset, the said asset is  created by way of tax credit to the statement of profit and loss. The Company reviews the such tax credit  asset at each reporting date and writes down the asset to the extent the Company does not have sufficient  taxable temporary difference /convincing evidence that it will pay normal tax during the specified period.  Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. 

514 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   h)   Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)       Property, Plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises the purchase price, borrowing costs (if capitalisation criteria are  met) and other cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use.       Property, Plant and Equipment and Capital Work in progress are stated at cost. Such cost includes the cost  of replacing parts of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if  the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced  at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a  major inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as  a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to  statement of profit or loss as incurred.       The Company adjusts exchange differences arising on translation difference/settlement of long term  foreign currency monetary items outstanding in the Indian GAAP financial statements for the period ending  immediately before the beginning of the first Ind AS financial statements i.e. March 31, 2016 and pertaining  to the acquisition of a depreciable asset to the cost of asset and depreciates the same over the remaining  useful life of the asset. The depreciation on such foreign exchange difference is recognised from first day  of the financial year.       Borrowing cost relating to acquisition / construction of Property, Plant and Equipment which take substantial  period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the period till  such assets are ready to be put to use.       Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as prescribed  under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets mentioned below for which  useful lives estimated by the management and assessment made by expert. The identified component of  fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives and the remaining components are depreciated over  the life of the principal assets. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and  reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used.       The Company has estimated the following useful life to provide depreciation on its certain Property, Plant  and Equipments based on assessment made by expert and management estimate. Assets Estimated Useful life  Leasehold Land Development Over the balance period of Concession Agreement and  approved Supplementary Concession Agreement by  Gujarat Maritime board as applicable Marine Structure, Dredged Channel, Building  RCC Frame Structure 50 Years as per concession agreement Dredging Pipes - Plant and Machinery  1.5 Years Nylon and Steel coated belt on Conveyor - Plant  and Equipment 4 Years and 10 Years respectively Inner Floating and outer floating hose, String of  Single Point Mooring - Plant and Machinery 6 Years Fender, Buoy installed at Jetty - Marine  Structures 5 - 10 Years Drains & Culverts 25 Years as per concession agreement  Carpeted Roads – Other than RCC 10 Years Tugs 20 Years as per concession agreement 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 515 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       At the end of the sub-concession agreement and supplementary concession agreement, all contracted  immovable and movable assets shall be transferred to and shall vest in Gujarat Maritime Board (‘GMB’)  for consideration equivalent to the Depreciated Replacement Value (the ‘DRV’). Currently DRV is not  determinable, accordingly, residual value of contract asset is considered to be the carrying value based  on depreciation rates as per management estimate/ Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 at the end of  concession period.       An item of property, plant and equipment covered under Concession agreement, sub-concession agreement  and supplementary concession agreement, shall be transferred to and shall vest in Grantor (government  authorities) at the end of respective concession agreement. In cases, where the Company is expected to  receive consideration of residual value of property from grantor at the end of concession period, the residual  value of contracted property is considered as the carrying value at the end of concession period based  on depreciation rates as per management estimate/Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 and in other  cases it is  `  Nil.       An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is derecognized upon  disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising  on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the  carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.       The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed  at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively.   i)   Intangible assets       Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable  to the asset will flow to the company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets  acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  amortisation  and  accumulated  impairment  losses.  Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the  related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.       Intangible assets are not ready for the intended use on the Balance Sheet date are disclosed as "Intangible  assets under development".     The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.       Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment  whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the  amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each  reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future  economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as  appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible  assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part  of carrying value of another asset.       Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually,  either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually  to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from  indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.       Intangible assets are de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from  its use. Any gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement  of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. 

516 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     A summary of the policies applied to the Company’s intangible assets is as follows: Intangible Assets  Method of Amortisation  Estimated Useful life  Software applications  on straight line basis  5 Years based on management estimate Railway License on straight line basis  35 Years based on validity of license   j)   Borrowing costs       Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that  necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as  part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.  Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing  of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences arising on translation of monetary items  denominated in foreign currencies.   k)   Leases       The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract  conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.     Company as a lessee       The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term  leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and  right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.     i)    Right-of-Use Assets         The Company recognises right-of-use assets (“RoU Assets”) at the commencement date of the lease  (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any  accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of  lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial  direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease  incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the  lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.         If ownership of the leased asset transferred to the company at the end of the lease term or the cost  reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of  the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in  section (m) Impairment of non-financial assets.    ii)   Lease  Liabilities         At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the  present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed  payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease  payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value  guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain  to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term  reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend  on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in  the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.         In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at  the lease commencement date in case the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 517 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of  interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is  remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g.,  changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease  payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.     iii)    Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets         The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those  leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a  purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption that are considered  to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as  expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.     Company as a lessor     Income from long term leases       As a part of its business activity, the Company leases / sub-leases certain assets on long term basis to its  customers. Leases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of lease transfer substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating lease. In some  cases, the Company enters into cancellable lease / sub-lease transaction agreement, while in other cases,  it enters into non-cancellable lease / sub-lease agreement. The Company recognizes the income based on  the principles of leases as set out in relevant accounting standard and accordingly in cases where the lease  / sub-lease agreement are cancellable in nature, the income in the nature of upfront premium received  / receivable is recognized on operating lease basis i.e. on a straight line basis over the period of lease /  sub-lease agreement / date of memorandum of understanding takes effect over lease period and annual  lease rentals are recognized on an accrual basis.       In  cases  where  long  term  lease  /  sub-lease  agreement  are  non-cancellable  in  nature,  the  income  is  recognized on finance lease basis i.e. at the inception of lease / sub-lease agreement / date of memorandum  of understanding takes effect over lease period, the income recognized is equal to the present value of  the minimum lease payment over the lease period (including non-refundable upfront premium) which is  substantially equal to the fair value of leased / sub-leased. In respect of land given on finance lease basis,  the corresponding cost of the land and development costs incurred are expensed off in the statement of  profit and loss.   l)   Inventories     Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value.       Stores and Spares: Valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a moving weighted  average basis. Cost of stores and spares lying in bonded warehouse includes custom duty payable.       Stores and Spares which do not meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are accounted  as inventories.       Net Realisable Value in respect of stores and spares is the estimated current procurement price in the  ordinary course of the business.   m)   Impairment of non-financial assets       The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.  If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates  the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating  unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an  

518 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those  from other assets or group of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable  amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.       In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to  the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account.  If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are  corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair  value indicators.       The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which  are prepared separately for each of the Company’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.  These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term  growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.     Impairment losses including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.       For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there  is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such  indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised  impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the  asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the  carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that  would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in  prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless the asset is carried at a  revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.       Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at every year end and when circumstances indicate that the  carrying value may be impaired.       Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of CGU to which the goodwill  relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is  recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.       Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually at year end at the CGU level,  as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.   n)   Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets    General       Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a  past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating  to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but  disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent assets are disclosed where  inflow of economic benefits is probable.       If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate  that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in  the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 519 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Operational Claim provisions       Provisions  for  operational  claims  are  recognised  when  the  service  is  provided  to  the  customer.  Further recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of operational claim related cost  is revised annually.   o)   Retirement and other employee benefits       Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Company has no  obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. The Company recognizes contribution  payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service.  If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the  contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid.       The Company operates a defined benefit gratuity plan in India, which requires contributions to be made to  a separately administered fund. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined  using the projected unit credit method.       Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding  amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding  amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the  balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which  they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods.       Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.  The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the  statement of profit and loss:    Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and  non-routine settlements; and    Net interest expense or income       Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilised within the next twelve months, is treated as short term  employee benefits. The Company measures the expected cost of such absence as the additional amount  that is expected to pay as a result of the unused estimate that has accumulated at the reporting date.  The Company treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months as long term  compensated absences which are provided for based on actuarial valuation as at the end of the period.  The actuarial valuation is done as per projected unit credit method. The Company presents the entire leave  as a current liability in the balance sheet, since it does not have an unconditional right to defer it’s settlement  for twelve months after the reporting date.   p)   Financial instruments       A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability  or equity instrument of another entity.    Financial  assets     Initial recognition and measurement       All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus in case of financial asset not recorded at fair  value through profit and loss, transaction cost that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial  assets. Trade receivable that do not contain a significant financing component are initially recognised at  transaction price. 

520 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025    Subsequent  measurement     For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in three categories:    Debt instruments at amortised cost    Debt instruments, derivative financial instruments and equity instruments at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL)    Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)     Debt instruments at amortised cost     A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:   (a)     The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual  cash flows, and   (b)      Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.       This category is most relevant to the Company. After initial measurement, such financial assets are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost  is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an  integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses  arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss.     Debt instrument at FVTPL       FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for  categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.       Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized  in the statement of profit and loss.       The Company classifies its debt instruments which are held for trading under FVTPL category. Held for  trading assets are recorded and measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value. Gains and losses on changes in  fair value of debt instruments are recognised on net basis through profit or loss.     Debt instrument at FVTOCI       A debt instrument is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held  within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.    Equity  investments       All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. For equity instruments, the Company  may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income, subsequent changes in the fair  value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made  on initial recognition and is irrevocable.       If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the  instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to  P&L, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.       Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognized in the P&L. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 521 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are accounted for at cost less impairment, if any.    Perpetual  debt       The Company invests in a subordinated perpetual debt, redeemable at the issuer's option, with a fixed coupon  that can be deferred indefinitely if the issuer does not pay a dividend on its equity shares. The Company  classifies these instruments as equity under Ind AS 32.    Derecognition       A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets)  is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company’s balance sheet) when:    The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or    The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation  to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’  arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the  asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of  the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.       When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a  pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of  ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the  asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the  extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated  liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights  and obligations that the Company has retained.       Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the  lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the  Company could be required to repay.     Impairment of financial assets       The Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss  on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure :     a)      Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g. loans, debt  securities, deposits and bank balances.     b)    Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)     c)    Lease receivables under Ind As 116     d)      Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from  transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115     The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on:    Trade receivables or contract revenue receivables; and    All lease receivables resulting from transactions within the scope of Ind As 116       Under the simplified approach the Company does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises  impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.       For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Company determines  that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk  

522 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 has not increased significantly, 12 month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk  has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.       ECL is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with  the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at the original EIR.  ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as income / (expense)  in the statement of profit and loss (P&L).     The balance sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below:     Financial assets measured as at amortised cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables:       ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance  sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company  does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount.       For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the Company combines financial instruments on  the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed  to enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis.    Financial  liabilities     Initial recognition and measurement       Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives, as appropriate.       All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and  payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.       The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank  overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.    Subsequent  measurement     The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:     Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss       Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial  liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities  are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.  This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not  designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.     Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.       Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated  as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities  designated as FVTPL, fair value gains / losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in  OCI. These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the Company may transfer the  cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.       The Company classifies its debt instruments which are held for trading under FVTPL category. Held for  trading assets are recorded and measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value. Gains and losses on changes in  fair value of debt instruments are recognised on net basis through profit or loss. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 523 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Loans and borrowings       After initial recognition at fair value, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss  when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.       Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or  costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement  of profit and loss.     This category generally applies to borrowings.     Financial guarantee contracts       Financial guarantee contracts issued by the company are those contracts that require a payment to be  made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment  when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised  initially as a liability at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), adjusted for transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.     After initial recognition, an issuer of such a contract shall subsequently measure it at the higher of:     (i)    the amount of the loss allowance determined and     (ii)      the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in  accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115    Derecognition       A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or  expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially  different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or  modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.  The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.     Reclassification of financial assets       The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial  recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial  liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a  change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to  be infrequent. The Company’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of  external or internal changes which are significant to the Company’s operations. Such changes are evident  to external parties. A change in the business model occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to  perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies  the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately  next reporting period following the change in business model. The Company does not restate any previously  recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.     Offsetting of financial instruments       Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if  there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to  settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 

524 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   q)   Derivative financial instruments     Initial recognition and subsequent measurement       The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, cross currency  swaps, options, interest rate futures and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest  rate risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value through  profit or loss (FVTPL) on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently  re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as  financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.       Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument or on settlement  of such derivative financial instruments are recognised in statement of profit and loss and are classified  as Foreign Exchange (Gain) / Loss except those relating to borrowings, which are separately classified  under Finance Cost.   r)   Redeemable preference shares     Redeemable preference shares are initially recognised at fair value and classified as financial liability.       On issuance of the redeemable preference shares, the fair value of the liability component is determined  as net present value of transaction using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument.  This amount is classified as a financial liability measured at amortised cost (net of transaction costs) until it  is extinguished on redemption. The residual amount is classified under Equity.       Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the redeemable preference  shares based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are  initially recognised.   s)   Cash and cash equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks & on hand and short-term deposits  with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.       For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term  deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the  Company’s cash management.   t)   Cash dividend to equity holders of the company       The Company recognises a liability for payment of dividend to equity holders of the Company when the  distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the  corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding  amount is recognised directly in equity.   u)   Earnings per share       Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders  by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.       For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit for the period attributable to equity  shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the  effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.   v)   Business Combination       Business Combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind  AS 103, Business Combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets  transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 525 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 the date on which control is transferred to the Company. The cost of acquisition also includes fair value of  any contingent considerations. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed  in a business combination are measured initially at the fair value on the date of acquisition.       Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination are  expensed as incurred.       Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control are  accounted for using the pooling of interests method. The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are  reflected at their carrying amounts and no adjustments are made to reflect their fair values or recognise  any new assets or liabilities. The difference between any consideration given and the aggregate historical  carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded in capital reserve and presented  separately from other capital reserves.       If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of reporting period in which  the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is  incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or  liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at  the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amount recognised at that date.       Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of  the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.   w)   Amended standards adopted by the Company       The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are consistent with those  followed in the preparation of the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended March 31,  2024, except for amendments to the existing Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS). The Company has not  early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.       The Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified new standards or amendment to existing standards under  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.       The Company applied following amendments for the first-time during the current year which are effective  from April 01, 2024:     Introduction of Ind AS 117       MCA notified Ind AS 117, a comprehensive standard that prescribe, recognition, measurement and disclosure  requirements, to avoid diversities in practice for accounting insurance contracts and it applies to all  companies i.e., to all "insurance contracts" regardless of the issuer. However, Ind AS 117 is not applicable to  the entities which are insurance companies registered with IRDAI.       Additionally,  amendments  have  been  made  to  Ind  AS  101,  First-time  Adoption  of  Indian  Accounting  Standards,  Ind  AS  103,  Business  Combinations,  Ind  AS  105,  Non-current  Assets  Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued Operations, Ind AS 107, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments  and Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to align them with Ind AS 117. The amendments also  introduce enhanced disclosure requirements, particularly in Ind AS 107, to provide clarity regarding financial  instruments associated with insurance contracts.       Amendments to Ind AS 116 -Lease liability in a sale and leaseback       The amendments require an entity to recognise lease liability including variable lease payments which are  not linked to index or a rate in a way it does not result into gain on Right of use asset it retains.       The Company has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has determined that  these amendments do not have a significant impact on the Company's Financial Statements. 

526 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 2.3   Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions     The preparation of the Company’s Ind AS Financial Statements requires management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and  the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions  and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or  liabilities affected in future periods.   (A)   Judgements       In the process of applying the accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which  has the most significant effect on the financial statements:     (i)   Entities in which the Company holds less than a majority of voting rights (de facto control):-       a)      The Company owns 49% ownership interest in Dholera Infrastructure Private Limited ("DIPL").  The Company has entered into an agreement with the other shareholders of the DIPL basis  which the directors of the Company have assessed that it has the practical ability to direct  the relevant activities of DIPL unilaterally and therefore Company has control over DIPL and  considered as subsidiary.       b)     The Company along with its subsidiary owns 49% ownership interest in Mundra Solar Technopark  Private Limited. The Company took control over business against outstanding receivables from  the said entity. The Company also exercises control over board of the said entity pursuant to a  shareholder agreement consequential to which the Company has considered as subsidiary.       c)      The Company along with its subsidiary owns 48.97% ownership interest in Mundra LPG Terminal  Private Limited ("MLTPL"). Considering the further Investment in equity instrument, the Company  has obtained management and operational control of MLTPL from April 2022 and the same has  been considered as subsidiary.   (B)    Estimates and assumptions       The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting  date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and  liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and  estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances  arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur.     i)   Impairment of financial assets         The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and  expected cash loss. The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the  inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Company’s past history, existing market conditions as  well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Refer note 4(b).    ii)    Taxes         Deferred tax (including MAT Credits) assets are recognised for unused tax credits to the extent  that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the credits can be utilised.  Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can  be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future  tax planning strategies. Further details on taxes are disclosed in note 27. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 527 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     iii)    Fair value measurement         In measuring the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for financial reporting purpose, the Company  uses market observable data to the extent available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the  Company engages third party qualified valuers to establish appropriate valuation techniques and inputs  to the model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where  this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions  about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Refer note 34 for  further disclosures.     iv)   Depreciation / amortisation and useful lives of property plant and equipment / intangible assets         Property, plant and equipment / intangible assets are depreciated / amortised over their estimated  useful lives, after taking into account estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated  useful lives and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation  / amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful lives and residual values are  based on the Company’s historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated  technological changes.

The goodwill is tested  for impairment annually. As at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 the goodwill is not impaired.       The recoverable amount of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculation. The key assumptions for  the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and  expected changes to  direct costs during the year. Management estimates discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current  market assessments of the time value of money. The growth rate are based on management's forecasts.  Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes  in the market. The Company prepares its forecasts based on the most recent financial budget approved by  management with projected revenue growth rates. The management believes that any reasonable possible  change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.  Goodwill is attributable to future growth of business out of synergies.   ii)   Refer footnote to note 14 and 18 for security / charges created. 3.

During the year ended on March 31, 2023, AVCTPL and VPT had initiated termination on mutual consent  as per right under the concession agreement citing force majeure events, which went for arbitration.  Both the parties have filed the claim with arbitrators and the final outcome is yet to be decided.         During the year ended on March 31, 2022, the arbitration tribunal, in its interim order, observed that  terminal remaining idle leads to its deterioration and fails to generate any revenue. Hence, terminal  should be put to operation without any delay and has directed VPT to release an ad-hoc interim payment  to AVCTPL. Based on such directions, ad-hoc payment of  `  155 crore has been received against handing  over the possession, management and operational control of the terminal, leaving open all rights and  contentions of both parties for examination at a later stage. Company has reassessed the carrying  values of its loan and equity investment in AVCTPL in light of the aforesaid developments and has  continued to carry these balances at values net of impairment provisions amounting to  `  297.38 crore.     (ii)     The carrying amounts of long-term investments in equity shares of Adani Murmugao Port Terminal  Private Limited ("AMPTPL") amounts to  `  115.89 crore as at March 31, 2025 and non-current loans given  to AMPTPL amounts to  `  423.01 crore as at March 31, 2025. The Company has been providing financial  support to AMPTPL to meet its financial obligations as and when required in the form of loans, which  are recoverable at the end of the concession period. AMPTPL had been in arbitration with Mormugao  Port Trust (MPT) regarding revenue share on deemed storage charges and loss of return on capital  due to MPT's non-fulfilment of obligations under the concession agreement until June 2019. In earlier  years, AMPTPL had created a provision amounting to  `  134.61 crore for revenue share on deemed  storage charges based on the demand raised by Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) in FY 2016 -17 and and  continued to account provision for the period till September 2019. During the year, the Conciliation and  Settlement Committee (CSC) finalized a settlement agreement under the Arbitration and Conciliation  Act, 1996. As per the settlement, royalty on storage charges was agreed at 20% of 1% of the Annual  Revenue Requirement (ARR). Consequently, AMPTPL has reversed the excess provision of  `  132.35  crore during the year ended March 31, 2025.         The Company has determined the recoverable amounts of its investments and loans in AMPTPL as at  March 31, 2025 by considering a discounted cash flow model. Such determination is based on significant  estimates & judgements made by the management as regards the benefits of the rationalization of  revenue share on storage income, cargo traffic, port tariffs, inflation, discount rates which have been  considered over the remaining concession period and are considered reasonable by the Management.  On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Company’s management has concluded that no  provision for impairment in respect of such investments and loans is considered necessary at this stage.

The management decides its contribution based on the results of this review.  The management aims to keep annual contributions relatively stable at a level such that no plan deficits  (based on valuation performed) will arise.

(xi)     Asset - Liability Matching Strategies       The Company has purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in  which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance  Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year  (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). The policy, thus, mitigates the liquidity risk.        However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of  liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in  interest rates, which should result in a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset). 31   Segment Information     The Company is primarily engaged in one business segment, namely developing, operating and maintaining  the ports services, ports related Infrastructure development activities and development of infrastructure at  contiguous Special Economic Zone at Mundra, as determined by chief operating decision maker, in accordance  with Ind-AS 108 "Operating Segments".     Considering the inter relationship of various activities of the business, the chief operating decision maker  monitors the operating results of its business segment on overall basis. Segment performance is evaluated based  on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the financial statements. 30   Disclosures as required by Ind AS - 19 Employee Benefits  (Contd.)

The company has entered into call option agreement for an equity investment, whereby the company  has agreed to grant the buyer an option to purchase the underlying equity investment, the fair value of  such call option as at March 31, 2025 is  `  Nil (previous year  `  10.17 crore). The fair value is determined  using the Black-Scholes Model which takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the  spot price, expected price volatility and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option. The critical  inputs for options granted are : (i) Expected price volatility : 38 %  (ii) Risk-free interest rate: 5.60 % (iii)  Intrinsic value : Nil.   b)    Description of significant unobservable inputs to valuation:       The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the  fair value hierarchy together with a quantitative sensitivity analysis as at March 31, 2025 and March 31,  2024 are as shown below: Particulars Valuation   technique Significant   unobservable inputs Weighted  average Sensitivity of the  input to fair value FVTOCI assets in  unquoted equity shares Cost Approach  (Summation Method) Underlying Assets NA NA       During the previous year, company has changed valuation technique from DCF (under Income approach)  to Cost approach as it represent more reasonable estimate of fair value based on valuation report by  Registered valuer.   c)    Financial Instrument measured at Amortised Cost       The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost in the financial  statements are a reasonable approximation of their fair values since the Company does not anticipate  that the carrying amounts would be significantly different from the values that would eventually be  received or settled. 34.3   Financial Risk Management objective and policies     The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and  other payables, lease liabilities and financial guarantee contracts. The main purpose of these financial liabilities  is to finance the Company’s operations/projects and to provide guarantees to support its operations and its  subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company’s principal financial assets include loans, investment including  mutual funds, trade and other receivables, lease receivables and cash and cash equivalents which is derived  from  its operations. The Company also holds FVTOCI investments and enters into derivative transactions.     In the ordinary course of business, the Company is mainly exposed to risks resulting from exchange rate  fluctuation (currency risk), interest rate movements (interest rate risk) collectively referred as Market Risk, Credit  Risk, Liquidity Risk and other price risks such as equity price risk. The Company's senior management oversees  the management of these risks. It manages its exposure to these risks through derivative financial instruments  by hedging transactions. It uses derivative instruments such as Cross Currency Swaps, Full Currency swaps,  Interest rate swaps, foreign currency future options and foreign currency forward contract to manage these  risks. These derivative instruments reduce the impact of both favourable and unfavourable fluctuations.     The Company’s risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control of Central  Treasury Team of the Company under the framework of Risk Management Policy for Currency and Interest  rate risk as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company’s central treasury team ensures  appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company through appropriate policies & procedures  and financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk  objectives. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. 

596 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     The decision of whether and when to execute derivative financial instruments along with its tenure can vary  from period to period depending on market conditions and the relative costs of the instruments. The tenure is  linked to the timing of the underlying exposure, with the connection between the two being regularly monitored.  The Company is exposed to losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the derivative  contracts. All derivative contracts are executed with counterparties that, in our judgment, are creditworthy.  The outstanding derivatives are reviewed periodically to ensure that there is no inappropriate concentration of  outstanding to any particular counterparty.     Further, all currency and interest risk as identified above is measured on a daily basis by monitoring the mark  to market (MTM) of open and hedged position. The MTM is derived based on underlying market curves on  closing basis of relevant instrument quoted on Bloomberg/Reuters. For period end, the MTM for each derivative  instrument outstanding is obtained from respective banks. All gain / loss arising from MTM for open derivative  contracts and gain / loss on settlement / cancellation / roll over of derivative contracts is recorded in statement  of profit and loss.   a)   Market risk       Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because  of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and  other price risk, such as equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and  borrowings, deposits, FVTOCI investments, short term Investments and derivative financial instruments.     The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024.       The sensitivity analysis have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed  to  floating  interest  rates  of  the  debt  and  derivatives  and  the  proportion  of  financial  instruments  in  foreign currencies are all constant as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024. The analysis exclude the  impact of movements in market variables on: the carrying values of gratuity and other post-retirement  obligations; provisions.     The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:     -     The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective  market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at March 31, 2025 and  March 31, 2024.     (i)    Interest rate risk         The Company is exposed to changes in market interest rates due to financing, investing and cash  management activities. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates  relates primarily to the Company’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates and period  of borrowings. The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and  variable rate loans and borrowings. The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts or interest  rate future contracts to manage its exposure to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rates.       Interest rate sensitivity         The following paragraph demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates  on loans and borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Company's profit before  tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:          If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher / lower and all other variables were held constant, the  Company's profit for the year ended  March 31, 2025 would decrease / increase by  `  10.07 crore (previous  year  `  5.55 crore). This is mainly attributable to interest rates on variable rate of long term borrowings.  The same has been calculated based on risk exposure outstanding as on balance sheet date. The year  end balances are not necessarily representative of average debt outstanding during the year. 34   Financial Instruments, Fair Value Measurements, Financial Risk and Capital Management   (Contd.) 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 597 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     (ii)    Foreign currency risk         Exchange rate movements, particularly the United States Dollar (USD) and Euro (EUR) against Indian  Rupee (INR), have an impact on the Company’s operating results. The Company manages its foreign  currency risk by entering into currency swap for converting other foreign currency loan into INR.  The Company also enters into various foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk arising out  of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings or creditors. Further, to hedge  foreign currency future transactions in respect of which firm commitment are made or which are highly  probable forecast transactions (for instance, foreign exchange denominated income) the Company has  entered into foreign currency forward contracts as per the policy of the Company.         The Company is mainly exposed to changes in USD, EURO, CHF, SGD and CNY. The below table  demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1% increase or decrease in the respective foreign currency rates  against INR, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis is prepared on the net  unhedged exposure of the Company as at the reporting date. 1% represents management’s assessment  of reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rate.         The Company’s forex revenues provide a natural hedge to its forex debt, derisking it against  currency movements. `  In crore Particulars Impact on Profit before tax Impact on Pre-tax Equity For the year ended March 31, 2025 For the year ended March 31, 2024 For the year ended March 31, 2025 For the year ended March 31, 2024 USD Sensitivity RUPEES / USD –  Increase by 1%  (256.72) (284.13) (256.72) (284.13) RUPEES / USD –  Decrease by 1%  256.72   284.13   256.72   284.13  EURO Sensitivity RUPEES / EURO –  Increase by 1% (0.01) (0.02) (0.01) (0.02) RUPEES / EURO –  Decrease by 1%  0.01   0.02   0.01   0.02  SGD Sensitivity RUPEES / SGD –  Increase by 1% *  *  *  *  RUPEES / SGD –  Decrease by 1% *  *  *  *  CHF Sensitivity RUPEES / CHF –  Increase by 1%   -   *    -   *  RUPEES / CHF –  Decrease by 1%   -   *    -   *  CNY Sensitivity RUPEES / CNY –  Increase by 1% (1.11)   -   (1.11)   -   RUPEES / CNY –  Decrease by 1%  1.11    -    1.11    -         * Figures being nullified on conversion to  `  in crore 34   Financial Instruments, Fair Value Measurements, Financial Risk and Capital Management   (Contd.)

The Company manages the equity price risk through  diversification and by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments. Reports on the equity  portfolio are submitted to the Company’s senior management on a regular basis. The Company’s Board  of Directors reviews and approves all equity investment decisions. The Company has given corporate guarantees and pledged part of its investment in equity in order to  fulfil the collateral requirements of the subsidiary and joint venture companies. The counterparties  have an obligation to return the guarantees/ securities to the Company. There are no other significant  terms and conditions associated with the use of collateral.   b)    Credit risk       Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer  contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities  (primarily trade receivables and other financial assets) and from its financing activities, including loans  to others, deposits with banks, financial institutions & others, foreign exchange transactions and other  financial assets.       Customer credit risk is managed by the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to  customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive evaluation  and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment.       An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients.  In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for  impairment collectively. The calculation is based on exchange losses historical data.       Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and other counter parties is managed by the  Company’s treasury department in accordance with the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds  are  made  only  with  approved  counterparties  and  within  credit  limits  assigned  to  each  counterparty.  Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the Management of the Company on an annual basis, and may be  updated throughout the year subject to approval of the Company’s Finance Committee. The limits are set to  minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s potential  failure to make payments.       Corporate Guarantees given to banks and financial institutions against credit facilities availed by the  subsidiaries and joint ventures  `  9,406.14 crore (previous year  `  8,301.34 crore)     Concentrations of Credit risk form part of Credit risk       Considering that the Company operates the port services and provide related infrastructure services, the  Company is significantly dependent on such customers located at Mundra. Out of total income from port  operations, the Company earns 62% revenue (previous year 63%) from such customers, and with some of  these customers, the Company has long term cargo contracts. As at March 31, 2025, receivables from such  customer constitute 42% (previous year 30%) of total trade receivables. A loss of these customer could  adversely affect the operating result or cash flow of the Company.   c)   Liquidity risk       Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments  associated  with  financial  instruments  that  are  settled  by  delivering  cash  or  another  financial  asset.  Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair value. 34   Financial Instruments, Fair Value Measurements, Financial Risk and Capital Management   (Contd.) 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 599 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       The Company has an established liquidity risk management framework for managing its short term, medium  term and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company’s exposure to liquidity  risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Company  manages the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate funds in cash and cash equivalents. The Company also  has adequate credit facilities agreed with banks to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all its normal  operating commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner.

The primary objective of the company’s capital management is to maximize shareholder value. The Company  manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic environment and the  requirements of the financial covenants.     The company monitors capital using gearing ratio, which is net debt (total debt less cash and bank balance &  Investments in Mutual Fund) divided by total capital plus net debt. `  In crore Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Total Borrowings (refer note 14 and 18)  51,472.76   49,702.30  Less: Cash and bank balance (refer note 11)  1,644.24   3,754.83  Net Debt (A)  49,828.52   45,947.47  Total Equity (B)  30,436.59   29,354.16  Total Equity and Net Debt (C = A + B)  80,265.11   75,301.63  Gearing ratio (D=A/C) 62% 61% In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company's capital management, amongst other things, aims to  ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital  structure requirements.

The  Group  accounted  for  the  acquisitions under the acquisition method of  accounting for business combinations. Accordingly,  the purchase price was allocated to the assets  acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair  values  on  the  acquisition  date.  The  determination  of such fair values for the purpose of purchase price  allocation was considered to be a key focus area of our  audit as the allocation of the purchase consideration  based on fair values of assets acquired and liabilities  assumed involves judgments and estimates such as  appropriateness of the valuation methodology applied  and the discount rates applied to future cash flow  forecasts. Accounting  for  Business  Combination  is  a  key  audit  matter  considering  significant  estimates  and  management judgement involved in the assessment Our audit procedures included the following: 1.

616 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in our  audit 3 Assessing carrying value of goodwill for impairment  testing As at March 31, 2025, the Group’s carrying value of  goodwill is  `  7,093.59 crores. In accordance with Ind  AS, goodwill needs to be tested for impairment at every  reporting period. Recoverability of the carrying value  of goodwill is predicated upon appropriate attribution  of goodwill to a cash generating unit (CGU) or group  of cash generating units (CGUs) and determination of  recoverable amount of the underlying CGUs. Significant Management judgement is required in the  area of impairment testing, particularly in assessing  whether the carrying value of the CGU including the  goodwill can be supported by the recoverable amount.  Recoverability of the carrying values of goodwill is  dependent on future cash flows of the underlying  CGUs and there is a risk that if these cash flows do  not meet management’s expectations, the assets will  be impaired. The cash flow forecasts and related value in  use  calculations  include  a  number  of  significant  management assumptions, judgements and estimates  including  revenue  growth  rates,  net  profit  margin,  perpetual growth rates and discount rate that are  dependent on expected future market and economic  conditions. Any  change  in  the  basis  or  assumptions  could  materially affect the recoverable amount used in the  impairment test with a consequent impact on the  consolidated financial statements of the Group. In view of the foregoing, valuation and allocation of  goodwill has been identified as a Key Audit Matter. Our audit procedures included the following: 1.   Combination  of  testing  the  design,  implementation and operating effectiveness in  respect  of  management’s  basis  for  allocation  of goodwill to CGUs and determination of  recoverable amounts to measure the impairment  provision, if any, that needs to be accounted for. 2.   As part of our substantive testing procedures, we  have  examined  management’s  judgement  and  estimates in the area of impairment testing by  considering and evaluating cash flow projections,  the reasonableness of key assumptions including  revenue  growth  rates,  net  profit  margin  and  perpetual growth rates used to estimate future  cash flows and discount rates applied to these  forecasted future cash flows and retrospective  review of the projections. 3.   Involved valuation specialists where considered  necessary, to independently assess the  assumptions and methodologies used by the  Group in computing the recoverable amount. In  making this assessment, we also assessed the  objectivity, independence and competency of the  valuation specialists. 4.   Obtained  suitable  management  representation  on the projections of future cash flows and the  various assumptions used in the valuation. Tested  the arithmetical accuracy of the management’s  impairment testing model. 5.   Assessed the adequacy of relevant disclosures  made in the consolidated financial statements.

These arrangements have been entered  into to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk and  interest rate risk arising from certain debt instruments  denominated in foreign currency. The derivatives are  measured at fair value as per Ind AS 109. Mark to  market gain/loss on these derivatives are recognised  in the other comprehensive income for cash flow  hedges. In  view  of  significance  and  impact  on  financial  statements we have identified it as a key audit matter. We have applied following audit procedure in this  regard: 1.   Discussing  and  understanding  management’s  perception and studying policy of the Group for risk  management. Motive of derivative transactions  are studied and observed underlying exposure is  not more than the volume of derivatives. 2.   Verification of fair value of derivative in terms of  Ind AS 109. 3.   Testing  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  derivative transactions. 4.   Evaluation of management’s key internal controls  over  classification,  valuation,  and  valuation  models of derivative instruments. 5.   Obtained details of various financial derivative  contracts as outstanding as on March 31, 2025. 6.   Verification  of  underlying  assumptions  in  estimating the fair valuation arrived at for those  financial derivative contracts. 7.   We also obtained confirmations from the banks  with whom such financial derivative contracts  have been entered into and independently  compared the valuation so arrived at by the  contracting banks. 8.   Additionally, we have verified the accounting of  gain/loss on mark to market basis in the other  comprehensive income for cash flow hedges. 9.

624 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section  143(3)(i)  of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for  expressing our opinion on whether the Holding  Company  has  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements in place and the operating effectiveness  of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates and related disclosures made by the  management and Board of Directors. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of the management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern  basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty  exists related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its  associate and jointly controlled entities to continue  as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention  in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor’s  report.  However, future events or conditions may cause  the Group and its associate and jointly controlled  entities to cease to continue as a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the consolidated financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. •   Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the financial information of the entities  or business activities within the Group and  its associate and jointly controlled entities to  express an opinion on the consolidated financial  statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audit of the  financial statements of such entities included in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  which  we  are  the  independent  auditors.  For  the  other  entities or business activities included in the  consolidated  financial  statements,  which  have  been audited by other auditors, such other auditors  remain responsible for the direction, supervision  and performance of the audits carried out by them.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance of  the Holding Company and such other entities included in  the consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent auditors regarding, among other matters,  the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 625 From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the consolidated  financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025  and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s  report  unless  law  or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter  or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine  that a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication.

626 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Report on the Internal Financial Controls  under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section  143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) Opinion In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements of the Company as of and for the year ended  March 31, 2025, we have audited the internal financial  controls reference to consolidated financial statements  of  Adani  Ports  And  Special  Economic  Zone  Limited  (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) which  includes  the  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  of  the  Holding  Company’s  one  branch  and  its subsidiary companies (the Holding Company and  its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”),  its associate and jointly controlled entities, which are  companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal  Financial Controls The respective Management and the Board of Directors  of the Group and jointly controlled entities, which  are companies incorporated in India, are responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  internal  financial  controls based on the internal control with reference to  consolidated  financial  statements  criteria  established  by the respective companies considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note  issued  by  ICAI.  These  responsibilities  include  the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating  effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct  of its business, including adherence to the respective  company’s  policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its  assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors,  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements of the Group and jointly controlled entities,  which are companies incorporated in India, based on our  audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the Standards on  Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act,  to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan  and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  was established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects. ANNEXURE B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE  ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ADANI PORTS AND  SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED [Referred to in paragraph 1(h) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent  Auditor’s Report of even date to the Members of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited on the Consolidated  Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025] 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 627 Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial statements and their operating effectiveness.  Our audit of internal financial controls with reference  to consolidated financial statements included obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors  in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matter  paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements of the Group and jointly controlled entities,  which are companies incorporated in India. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls  With Reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements A Company’s internal financial control with reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  is  a  process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  consolidated financial statements for external purposes  in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance with authorizations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the consolidated financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls With Reference to Consolidated  Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial control with reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Other Matter Our  aforesaid  report  under  Section  143(3)(i)  of  the  Act  on  the  adequacy  and  operating  effectiveness  of  the  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated financial statements in so far as it relates  to 108 subsidiary companies and 21 jointly controlled  entities, which are companies incorporated in India, is  based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of  such companies incorporated in India. Our opinion is not  modified in respect of this matter.

(refer note 39(i)(3)) 2   Basis of preparation 2.1     The consolidated financial statements of the Group has been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 read with section  133 of Companies Act, 2013 and presentation requirements of Division II of schedule III to the Companies Act,  2013 (as amended).     Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially  adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in accounting policy as mentioned in  note 2.3 (aa) hitherto in use.     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical basis, except for the following assets  and liabilities which have been measured at fair value or revalued amount :-    Derivative financial instruments    Defined Benefit Plans - Plan Assets measured at fair value and      Certain  financial  assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  (refer  accounting  policy  regarding  financial instruments).     In addition, the consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( ` ) in crore and all values are  rounded off to two decimal ( `  00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated. 2.2   Principles of consolidation     The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries and joint  venture entities as at March 31, 2025. The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:-      Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities  of the investee)    Exposure or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and    The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns     Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption  and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all  relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:    The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee    Rights arising from other contractual arrangements    The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights     The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are  changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group  obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities,  income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated  

638 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 financial  statements  from  the  date  the  Group  gains  control  until  the  date  the  Group  ceases  to  control  the subsidiary.     Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other  events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted  in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate  adjustments are made to that Group member’s financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial  statements to ensure conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.     The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting  date as that of the parent company. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of  a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same  date as the financial statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of  the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.   Consolidation procedure:   (a)     Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of  its subsidiaries.   (b)     Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion  of equity of each subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any related goodwill.   (c)     Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to  transactions between entities of the Group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that  are recognised in assets, such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are eliminated in full).  Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial  statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of  profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions.         Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders  of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling  interests having a deficit balance. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash  flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.       A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity  transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:    Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary    Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests    Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity    Recognises the fair value of the consideration received    Recognises the fair value of any investment retained    Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss    Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained  earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets  or liabilities. 2.3   Summary of material accounting policy information   a)   Investment in associates and joint venture entities       An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power  to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but do not have control or joint  control over those policies. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 639 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       A joint venture entity is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the  arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is a contractually agreed  sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require  unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.       The considerations made in determining whether significant influence or joint control, are similar to those  necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.       The Group’s investments in its associate and joint venture entities are accounted for using the equity  method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture entities is initially  recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s  share of net assets of the joint venture/associates since the acquisition date.       Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with Investment in Joint Ventures/associates are  added to the cost of Investments.       The consolidated statement of profit and loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the  joint venture and associate entities. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s  OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the joint venture entities,  the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.  Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint venture entities  are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture entities.       If an entity’s share of losses of a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture  (which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the  associate or joint venture), the entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses  are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made  payments on behalf of the joint venture. If the joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity  resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses  not recognised.       The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of a joint venture entities is shown on the face of the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.       The financial statements of the joint venture entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.  When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.       After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an  impairment loss on its investment in its joint venture entities. At each reporting date, the Group determines  whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture entities are impaired. If there is  such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable  amount of the joint venture entities and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit  of a joint venture entities’ in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.       Upon loss of significant influence over associate entity/ joint control over the joint venture entities, the Group  measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying  amount of the associates entity / joint venture entities upon loss of significant influence or joint control  and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.   b)   Current versus non-current classification       The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification.  An asset is treated as current when it is:    Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle; or 

640 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025    Held primarily for the purpose of trading; or    Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or    Cash and cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least  twelve months after the reporting period.     All other assets are classified as non-current.     A liability is classified as current when:    It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle; or    It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or    It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or    There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting period     The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities respectively.       The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash  or cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.   c)   Foreign currency transactions :       The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in INR, which is also the parent company’s  functional currency. For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items included in  the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. However, for practical  reasons, the Group entities use an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of  transaction. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign operation the  gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that arises from using this method.     Transactions and balances       Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional  currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.       Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency  spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.       Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using  the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.    Group  companies       On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into INR at the rate of  exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at exchange  rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. For practical reasons, the group uses an average rate to  translate income and expense items, if the average rate approximates the exchange rates at the dates of  the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI  and parked in separate component of Other equity called ""Foreign Currency Translation Reserve"" (FCTR).  On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is  recognised in statement of profit and loss. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 641 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   d)   Fair value measurement       The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on  the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:    In the principal market for the asset or liability, or    In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability     The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.       The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use  when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest.       The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to  generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market  participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.       The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient  data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing  the use of unobservable inputs.       All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are  categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is  significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:     Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities       Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is directly or indirectly observable       Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is unobservable       For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group  determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization  (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period.       The Group's Management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement,  such as derivative financial instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value and for non  recurring fair value measurement, such as an assets under the scheme of business undertaking.       External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets such as business undertaking for transfer  under the scheme and unquoted financial assets and financial liabilities. Involvement of external valuers  is decided upon annually by the Management and in specific cases after discussion with and approval  by the respective company's Audit Committee. Selection criteria includes market knowledge, reputation,  independence  and  whether  professional  standards  are  maintained.  The  Management  decides,  after  discussions with the Group’s external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.       At each reporting date, the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities  which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Group’s accounting policies. For this analysis,  the Management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the  valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.       The Management, in conjunction with the Group’s external valuers, also compares the change in the fair value  of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. 

642 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the  basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy  as explained above.       This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the  relevant notes.    Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions (refer note 2.4 and 34.2)    Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy (refer note 34.2)    Investment in unquoted equity shares (refer note 4 and 10)    Financial instruments (including those carried at amortised cost) (refer note 34.1)   e)   Revenue recognition       Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred  to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.     The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.     Port operation and logistics services       Revenue from port operation services including cargo handling, storage, rail infrastructure, other ancillary  port services and logistics services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are  transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be  entitled in exchange for those services.       In cases, where the contracts include multiple contract obligations, the transaction price will be allocated  to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling prices. Where these prices are not directly  observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin. Revenue recorded by the Group is net  of variable consideration on account of various discounts offered by the Group as part of the contract.       Revenue on take-or-pay charges are recognised for the quantity that is the difference between annual  agreed tonnage and actual quantity of cargo handled. The amount recognised as revenue is exclusive of  goods and services tax wherever applicable.       Income in the nature of license fees / waterfront royalty and revenue share is recognised in accordance with  terms and conditions of relevant service agreement with customers/ sub concessionaire.       Income towards infrastructure premium is recognised as revenue in the year in which the Group provides  access to its common infrastructure.     Construction and Development of Infrastructure Assets       The  Company‘s  business  operations  includes  construction  and  development  of  infrastructure  assets.  Where the outcome of the project cannot be estimated reasonably, revenue from contracts for such  construction and development activities is recognised on completion of relevant activities under the  contract and the transfer of control of the infrastructure when all significant risks and rewards of ownership  in the infrastructure assets are transferred to the customer.     Non scheduled aircraft services     Revenue from chartered services is recognised when the service is performed under contractual obligations.     Revenue recognition from Service Concession arrangements in Agri Logistics Business       Service Concession arrangements revenue relating to construction contracts which are entered into with  Government Authorities for the construction of infrastructure necessary for the provision of services are  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 643 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivables. Revenue from service concession  arrangements is recognised based on the fair value of construction work performed at the reporting date.     Once the infrastructure is in operation, the treatment of income is as follows:       Finance income over financial asset after consideration of fixed storage charges is recognised using  effective interest rate method. Variable storage charges revenue is recognised in the period of storage of  food grains. Revenues from other variable charges such as loading and unloading charges, bagging charges,  stacking charges, etc. as per the rates mentioned in SCA are recognised in each period as and when services  are rendered in accordance with "Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers".    Interest  income       For all financial assets measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive  income, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly  discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument  or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised  cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates the expected  cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment,  extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is  included in finance income in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.    Dividend       Dividend Income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, which is  generally when shareholders approve the dividend.   f)   Government grants       Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and  all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as  income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate,  are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised either as a income in equal amounts over  the expected useful life of the related asset or by deducting from the carrying amount of the asset.     Royalty on Cargo       Waterfront royalty under the various concession/sub concession agreement is paid at concessional rate in  terms of rate prescribed by Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) and notified in official gazette of various state  Government authorities, wherever applicable.   g)   Exceptional Items       An item of income or expense which by its size, type or incidence requires disclosure in order to improve an  understanding of the performance of the Group is treated as an exceptional item and disclosed as such in  the financial statements.   h)   Taxes     Tax expense comprises of current income tax and deferred tax.     Current income tax       Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid  to the taxation authorities. Current income tax (including Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT")) is measured at  the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income-Tax Act, 1961 enacted  in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially  enacted, at the reporting date. 

644 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised  outside  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  (either  in  other  comprehensive  income  or  in  equity).  Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in  equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in  which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.    Deferred  tax       Deferred tax is provided using the balance-sheet approach on temporary differences between the tax bases  of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.     Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:-      When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a  transaction that (i) is not a business combination (ii) at the time of the transaction, affects neither the  accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and (iii) at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to  equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.      In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates  and interests in joint venture entities, deferred tax is not recognised when the timing of the reversal of  the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not  reverse in the foreseeable future.       Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax  credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that  taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of  unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:      When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial  recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time  of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.    In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates  and interests in joint venture entities, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is  probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be  available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.       Some of the subsidiaries and joint venture entities of the Company are also eligible for tax deductions  available under section 80IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for a period of 10 years out of eligible period of  15 years. In view of some of the subsidiaries and joint venture entities availing tax deduction under Section  80IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary difference,  which reverse after the tax holiday period in the year in which the temporary difference originate and no  deferred tax (assets or liabilities) is recognised in respect of temporary difference which reverse during  tax holiday period, to the extent such gross total income is subject to the deduction during the tax holiday  period. For recognition of deferred tax, the temporary difference which originate first are considered  to reverse first.       The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent  that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the  deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date  and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the  deferred tax asset to be recovered.       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when  the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or  substantively enacted at the reporting date. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 645 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in  other comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying  transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.       The Group recognizes tax credits in the nature of Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credit as an asset only  to the extent that there is sufficient taxable temporary difference/convincing evidence that the Group  will pay normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed to be  carried forward. In the year in which the Group recognises tax credits as an asset, the said asset is created  by way of tax credit to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Group reviews such tax credit  asset at each reporting date and writes down the asset to the extent the Group does not have sufficient  taxable temporary difference/convincing evidence that it will pay normal tax during the specified period.  Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit.   i)   Property, plant and equipment (PPE)       Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises the purchase price, borrowing costs (if capitalisation criteria are  met) and other cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use.       Property, plant and equipment and Capital work-in-progress are stated at cost. Such cost includes the cost  of replacing parts of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if  the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced  at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a  major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a  replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised  in consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the  decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of respective asset if recognition criteria  for the provision are met.       The Group adjusts exchange differences arising on translation difference/settlement of long term foreign  currency monetary items outstanding in the Indian GAAP financial statements for the period ending  immediately before the beginning of the first Ind AS financial statements i.e. March 31, 2016 and pertaining  to the acquisition of a depreciable asset to the cost of asset and depreciates the same over the remaining  useful life of the asset. The depreciation on such foreign exchange difference is recognised from first day  of the financial year.       Borrowing  cost  relating  to  acquisition  /  construction  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipments  which  take  substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to the  period till such assets are ready to be put to use.       Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as prescribed  under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets mentioned below for which  useful lives estimated by the management and assessment made by expert. The identified component of  fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives and the remaining components are depreciated over  the life of the principal assets. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and  reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used.       The Group has estimated the following useful life to provide depreciation on its certain Property, Plant and  Equipment based on assessment made by expert and management estimate. 

646 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Assets Estimated Useful life  Leasehold Land Development Over the balance period of Concession Agreement  and  approved  Supplementary  Concession  Agreement by Gujarat Maritime Board, other major  port trust authorities, State Government authorities  etc. as applicable Marine Structure, Dredged Channel, Building RCC  Frame Structure 50 Years as per concession agreement in case of  terminals entitlement to Depreciated Replacement  Value. In other cases over the balance period of  concession agreement as applicable Dredging Pipes - Plant and Equipment 1.5 Years Nylon and Steel coated belt on Conveyor - Plant and  Equipment 4 Years and 10 Years respectively Inner  Floating  and  outer  floating  hose,  String  of  Single Point Mooring - Plant and Equipment 6 Years Fender, Buoy installed at Jetty - Marine Structures 5 - 10 Years Drains & Culverts 25 Years as per concession agreement  Carpeted Roads – Other than RCC 10 Years Non Carpeted Roads – Other than RCC 3 Years Tugs 20 Years        An item of property, plant and equipment covered under Concession agreement, sub-concession agreement  and supplementary concession agreement, shall be transferred to and shall vest in Grantor (government  authorities)  at  the  end  of  respective  concession  agreement.  In  cases,  where  the  Group  is  expected  to receive consideration of residual value of property from grantor at the end of concession period, the  residual value of contracted property is considered as the carrying value at the end of concession period  based on depreciation rates as per management estimate/Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 and  in other cases it is Nil. For the ports operating in Gujarat, all contracted immovable and movable assets  shall be transferred to and shall vest in Gujarat Maritime Board (‘GMB’) for consideration equivalent to the  Depreciated Replacement Value (the ‘DRV’). Currently DRV is not determinable, accordingly, residual value  of contract asset is considered to be the carrying value based on depreciation rates as per management  estimate/ Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 at the end of concession period.       An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon  disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising  on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the  carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.       The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed  at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively.   j)   Intangible assets       Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to  the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired  separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business  combination is their fair value on the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are  carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated  intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is  reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 647 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Intangible assets are not ready for the intended use on the Balance Sheet date are disclosed as "Intangible  assets under development".     The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.       Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment  whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the  amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each  reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future  economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as  appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible  assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part  of carrying value of another asset.       Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually,  either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually  to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from  indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.       Intangible assets are de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from  its use. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.     A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets is, as follows: Intangible Assets  Method of Amortisation  Estimated Useful life  Software applications  on straight line basis 5 Years based on management  estimate License Fees paid to Ministry of  Railway (MOR) for approval  for  movement of Container Trains on straight line basis Over the license period of 20 years Right to Use of Land on straight line basis Over the period of agreement between  10-20 years Right of use to develop and operate  the port facilities including rights  arising from service concession  arrangement on straight line basis Over the balance period of Sub- Concession Agreement Railway License on straight line basis 20 to 35 Years based on validity of  license Customer Contact on straight line basis As per relevant Agreement Customer Relationship on straight line basis As per relevant Agreement Non-Compete Agreement on straight line basis As per relevant Agreement     Port concession rights arising from Service Concession/Sub-Concession Arrangements:       The Group recognises port concession rights as "Port Infrastructure Rights" under "Intangible Assets" arising  from a service concession arrangement, in which the grantor controls or regulates the services provided and  the prices charged, and also controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure such as property,  plant and equipment, if the infrastructure is existing infrastructure of the grantor or the infrastructure is  constructed or purchased by the Group as part of the service concession arrangement. Such an intangible  asset is recognised by the Group at cost (which is the fair value of the consideration received or receivable  

648 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 for the construction service delivered) and is capitalised when the project is complete in all respects and the  Group receives the completion certificate from the authorities as specified in the concession agreement.       Port concession rights also include certain property, plant and equipment which are reclassified as intangible  assets in accordance with Appendix C of Ind AS 115 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’. These assets are  amortised based on the lower of their useful lives or concession period.       Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of port concession rights are measured as the difference between  the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit or loss when the asset is de-recognised.     The period of port concession arrangements are of 30 years.     Service Concession Arrangements ("SCA") in respect of Agri Logistics Business       Certain companies in the Group have entered into service concession agreement with Food Corporation  of India (FCI) which is an arrangement between the "grantor" (a public sector entity/authority) and the  "operator" (a private sector entity) to provide services that give the public access to major economic and  social facilities utilising private-sector funds and expertise.       With respect to SCA, revenue and costs are allocated between those relating to construction services and  those relating to operation and maintenance services and are accounted for separately. Consideration  received or receivable is allocated by reference to the relative fair value of services delivered when the  amounts are separately identifiable. The infrastructure used in a concession are classified as an intangible  asset or a financial asset, depending on the nature of the payment entitlements established in the SCA.       When the amount of consideration under the arrangement for the provision of public services is substantially  fixed by a contract, the Group recognises the consideration for construction services at its fair value as a  financial asset and is classified as "financial asset under service concession arrangements".     When the amount of consideration under the arrangement comprises of -    fixed charges based on Annual Guaranteed Tonnage and    variable charges based on Actual Utilisation Tonnage,       then, the Group recognizes the consideration for construction services at its fair value, as the "financial  asset under service concession arrangement" to the extent present value of fixed payment to be received  discounted at incremental borrowing rate and the residual portion is recognised as an intangible asset.   k)   Investment Properties       Property which is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as Investment  Property. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to  initial recognition, policies with respect to depreciation, useful life and derecognition are followed on the  same basis as stated for Property, Plant & Equipment.   l)   Borrowing costs       Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that  necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as  part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.  Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing  of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences arising on translation of monetary items  denominated in foreign currencies.       Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on  qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 649 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   m)   Leases       The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract  conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.     Group as a lessee       The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term  leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and  right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.     i)   Right-of-Use Assets         The Group recognises right-of-use assets (“RoU Assets”) at the commencement date of the lease  (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less  any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease  liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial  direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease  incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the  lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.         If ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost  reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of  the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in  section (n) Impairment of non-financial assets.    ii)   Lease  Liabilities         At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present  value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments  (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments  that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.  The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be  exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects  the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index  or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in  which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.         In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at  the lease commencement date incase the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.  After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of  interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is  remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g.,  changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease  payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.     iii)   Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets         The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases  that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase  option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption that are considered to be low  value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense  on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

650 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Group as a lessor     Income from long term leases       As a part of its business activity, the Group leases/ sub-leases certain assets on long term basis to its  customers. Leases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of lease transfer substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating lease. In some  cases, the Company enters into cancellable lease / sub-lease transaction agreement, while in other cases,  it enters into non-cancellable lease / sub-lease agreement. The Company recognizes the income based on  the principles of leases as set out in relevant accounting standard and accordingly in cases where the lease  / sub-lease agreement are cancellable in nature, the income in the nature of upfront premium received  / receivable is recognised on operating lease basis i.e. on a straight line basis over the period of lease /  sub-lease agreement / date of memorandum of understanding takes effect over lease period and annual  lease rentals are recognised on an accrual basis.       In cases where long term lease / sub-lease transaction agreement are non-cancellable in nature, the income is  recognised on finance lease basis i.e. at the inception of lease / sub-lease agreement / date of memorandum  of understanding takes effect over lease period, the income recognised is equal to the present value of  the minimum lease payment over the lease period (including non-refundable upfront premium) which is  substantially equal to the fair value of land leased / sub-leased. In respect of land given on finance lease  basis, the corresponding cost of the land and development costs incurred are expensed off in the statement  of profit and loss.   n)   Inventories     Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value.       Stores and Spares: Valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on a moving weighted  average basis. Cost of stores and spares lying in bonded warehouse includes custom duty payable.       Stores and Spares which do not meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are accounted  as inventories.       Net Realizable Value in respect of stores and spares is the estimated current procurement price in the  ordinary course of the business.   o)   Impairment of non-financial assets       The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.  If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the  asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating  unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an  individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those  from other assets or group of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable  amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.       In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to  the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account.  If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are  corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair  value indicators.       The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are  prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets  and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate  is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 651 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Impairment losses including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.       For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there  is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such  indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised  impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the  asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the  carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that  would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in  prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless the asset is carried at a  revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.       Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at every year end and when circumstances indicate that the  carrying value may be impaired.       Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of CGU (or group of CGUs) to  which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an  impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.       Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as at year end at the CGU  level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.   p)   Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets    General       Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a  past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating  to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but  disclosed unless the probability of an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent assets are disclosed where  inflow of economic benefits is probable.       If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate  that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in  the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.     Operational Claim provisions       Provisions  for  operational  claims  are  recognised  when  the  service  is  provided  to  the  customer.  Further recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of operational claim related cost  is revised annually.   q)   Retirement and other employee benefits       Short term employee benefits include salaries, vacation and recovery days which are recognised as an  expense as the employee’s entitlement grows. Liability for cash bonus or a profit-sharing plan is recognised  when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount for service provided by employee  in the past and the amount can be easily estimated.       Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Group has no  obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. The Group recognizes contribution  payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service.  If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the  contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid. 

652 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       The Group operates a defined benefit gratuity plan in India, which requires contributions to be made to a  separately administered fund. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined  using the projected unit credit method.       Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding  amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding  amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the  balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which  they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.       Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group  recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss:      Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and  non-routine settlements and    Net interest expense or income       Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilised within the next twelve months, is treated as short term  employee benefits. The Group measures the expected cost of such absence as the additional amount that is  expected to pay as a result of the unused estimate that has accumulated at the reporting date. The Group  treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months as long term compensated  absences which are provided for based on actuarial valuation as at the end of the period. Provision for  Compensated Absences and its classifications between current and non-current liabilities are based on  independent actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation is done as per projected unit credit method.       The Group also makes Severance payments to certain employees located on ports outside India where the  expense is recognised on an ongoing basis based on increase in their accumulated seniority. Benefits provided  to employees outside India under a voluntary retirement plan are expensed in statement of profit and loss  when the plan is offered with no realistic possibility of cancellation and is reliably measured.   r)   Financial instruments       A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability  or equity instrument of another entity.    Financial  assets     Initial recognition and measurement       All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus in case of financial asset not recorded at fair  value through profit and loss, transaction cost that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets.  Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.     Subsequent measurement     For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in three categories:    Debt instruments at amortised cost      Debt instruments and derivative instruments and equity instruments at fair value through Profit  or loss (FVTPL)    Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)     Debt instruments at amortised cost     A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 653 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     (i)     The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual  cash flows, and     (ii)     Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.       This category is the most relevant to the Group. After initial measurement, such financial assets are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost  is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an  integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the consolidated statement  of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss.     Debt instrument at FVTPL       FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for  categorization as amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as FVTPL.       Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised  in the profit and loss.     The group classified investments in government securities held for trading under FVTPL.       The Company classifies its debt instruments which are held for trading under FVTPL category. Held for  trading assets are recorded and measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value. Gains and losses on changes in  fair value of debt instruments are recognised on net basis through profit or loss.     Debt instrument at FVTOCI       A debt instrument is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held  within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.    Equity  investments       All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. For all other equity instruments,  the Group may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes  in the fair value. The Group makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is  made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.       If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument,  excluding dividend, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and  loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.       Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognised in the profit and loss.     Derecognition       A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets)  is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group’s consolidated balance sheet) when:    The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or    The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation  to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’  arrangement and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the  asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the  asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 

654 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a  pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of  ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the  asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the  extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability.  The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and  obligations that the Group has retained.       Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the  lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group  could be required to repay.     Impairment of financial assets       The Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on  the following financial assets and credit risk exposure :     a)     Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g. loans, debt  securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balances     b)     Financial assets that are debt instruments, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive  income (FVTOCI)     c)     Lease receivables under relevant accounting standard     d)     Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from  transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115     The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on:     >   Trade receivables or contract revenue receivables; and     >   All lease receivables resulting from transactions within the scope of relevant accounting standard       Under the simplified approach the Group does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises  impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.       For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the group determines that  whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has  not increased significantly, 12 month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has  increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.       ECL is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with  the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original EIR.  ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as income / (expense)  in the statement of profit and loss (P&L).     The balance sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below:    Financial assets measured at amortised cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables:       ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance  sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the group  does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 655 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the Group combines financial instruments on the  basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to  enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis.    Financial  liabilities     Initial recognition and measurement       Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives, as appropriate.       All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and  payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.       The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts,  financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.     Subsequent measurement     The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:     Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss       Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and  financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities  are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.  This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated  as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.     Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.       Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated  as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities  designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in  OCI. These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to profit or loss. However, the Group may transfer  the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in  the statement of profit and loss.       The Company classifies its debt instruments which are held for trading under FVTPL category. Held for  trading assets are recorded and measured in the Balance Sheet at fair value. Gains and losses on changes in  fair value of debt instruments are recognised on net basis through profit or loss.     Loans and borrowings       After initial recognition at fair value , interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured  at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.       Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs  that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss.     This category generally applies to borrowings. 

656 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Financial guarantee contracts       Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made  to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due  in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially  as a liability at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), adjusted for transaction costs that are directly  attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.     After initial recognition, an issuer of such a contract shall subsequently measure it at the higher of:     (i)   the amount of the loss allowance determined and     (ii)     the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in  accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115     Derecognition       A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or  expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially  different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or  modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.  The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.     Reclassification of financial assets       The Group determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial  recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial  liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a  change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be  infrequent. The Group’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of external  or internal changes which are significant to the Group’s operations. Such changes are evident to external  parties. A change in the business model occurs when the Group either begins or ceases to perform an activity  that is significant to its operations. If the Group reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification  prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period  following the change in business model. The Group does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses  (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.       Offsetting of financial instruments       Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if  there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to  settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.   s)   Derivative financial instruments and Hedge accounting     Initial recognition and subsequent measurement of derivative financial instruments       The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps,  options, interest rate futures and interest rate swaps to hedge its short-term fluctuations foreign currency  risks and interest rate risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value through  profit or loss (FVTPL) on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently  re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as  financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value  of derivative financial instrument are classified in the statement of profit and loss and reported with foreign  exchange gains/(losses) not within results from operating activities. Changes in fair value and gains/(losses)  on settlement/remeasurement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments relating to borrowings,  which have not been designated as hedge are recorded as finance cost. 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 657 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025    Hedge  Accounting       The Group has implemented hedge accounting, an accounting policy choice under Ind AS by designating  its specific non-derivative foreign currency financial liabilities as hedging instruments in respect of foreign  currency risk on highly probable forecast sales being hedge item under cash flow hedges.       At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging  instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its hedging strategy.  Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents and performs  hedge effectiveness testing, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge  effectiveness requirements.     a)   there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.     b)     the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic  relationship; and     c)     the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the  hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group  actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.       If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio  but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group  adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e., rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying  criteria again.     Cash flow hedges      The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in OCI in the cash  flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the statement of  profit and loss.      Amounts recognized in OCI are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit  or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognized or when a highly  probable forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset or non-financial liability,  the amounts recognized as OCI are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial  asset or liability.      If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised or if its designation as a hedge  is revoked, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  or loss previously recognized in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs  or the foreign currency firm commitment is met. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to  occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized in profit or loss.   t)   Redeemable preference shares     Redeemable preference shares are initially recognised at fair value and classified as financial liability.       On issuance of the redeemable preference shares, the fair value of the liability component is determined  as net present value of transaction using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument.  This amount is classified as a financial liability measured at amortised cost (net of transaction costs) until it  is extinguished on redemption. The residual amount is classified under Equity.       Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the redeemable preference  shares based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are  initially recognised. 

658 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   u)   Cash and cash equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term  deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value.       For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and  short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral  part of the Group’s cash management.   v)   Cash dividend to equity holders of the parent       The Company recognises a liability for payment of dividend to equity holders of the parent when the  distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the  corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding  amount is recognised directly in equity.   w)   Goodwill on consolidation       Goodwill on consolidation as on the date of transition represents the excess of cost of acquisition at  each point of time of making the investment in the subsidiary over the Group’s share in the net worth of a  subsidiary. For this purpose, the Group’s share of net worth is determined on the basis of the latest financial  statements, prior to the acquisition, after making necessary adjustments for material events between the  date of such financial statements and the date of respective acquisition. Goodwill arising on consolidation  is not amortised, however, it is tested for impairment annually. In the event of cessation of operations of a  subsidiary, the unimpaired goodwill is written off fully.       Goodwill on consolidation is allocated to cash generating units or group of cash generating units that are  expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.   x)   Business Combination       Business Combination have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of  Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets  transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is  the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The cost of acquisition also includes fair value of any  contingent considerations. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in  a business combination are measured initially at the fair value on the date of acquisition.       Business Combinations between entities under common control is accounted for in accordance with  Appendix C of Ind AS-103.     Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.       If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of reporting period in which  the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is  incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or  liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at  the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amount recognised at that date.       Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of  the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.   y)   Non-current Assets held for sale       Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended  to be recovered principally through a sale (rather than through continuing use) when the asset (or disposal  group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 659 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 customary for sale of such asset (or disposal group) and the sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify  for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.       Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying  amount and fair value less costs to sell.   z)   Earnings per Share       Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders  by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.       For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit for the period attributable to equity  shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the  effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.   aa)   New Standards, Interpretations and Amended standards adopted by the Group       The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent  with those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the  year ended March 31, 2024, except for amendments to the existing Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).  The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued  but is not yet effective. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified new standards or amendment to existing  standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. The Group  applied following amendments for the first-time during the current year which are effective from 1 April 2024:     Introduction of Ind AS 117       MCA  notified  Ind  AS  117,  a  comprehensive  standard  that  prescribes,  recognition,  measurement  and  disclosure requirements, to avoid diversities in practice for accounting insurance contracts and it applies to  all companies i.e., to all "insurance contracts" regardless of the issuer. However, Ind AS 117 is not applicable  to the entities which are insurance companies registered with IRDAI.       Additionally,  amendments  have  been  made  to  Ind  AS  101,  First-time  Adoption  of  Indian  Accounting  Standards,  Ind  AS  103,  Business  Combinations,  Ind  AS  105,  Non-current  Assets  Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued Operations, Ind AS 107, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments  and Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to align them with Ind AS 117. The amendments also  introduce enhanced disclosure requirements, particularly in Ind AS 107, to provide clarity regarding financial  instruments associated with insurance contracts.     Amendments to Ind AS 116 - Lease liability in a sale and leaseback       The amendments require an entity to recognise lease liability including variable lease payments which are  not linked to index or a rate in a way it does not result into gain on Right of use asset it retains.       The Company has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has determined that  these amendments do not have a significant impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. 2.4   Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions     The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and  the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions  and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or  liabilities affected in future periods.   (A)     Judgements       In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements,  which has the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements: 

660 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     (i)     Consolidation of entities in which the Group holds less than a majority of voting rights (de facto  control):-     a)     Group owns 49% ownership interest in Dholera Infrastructure Private Limited ("DIPL"). Group has  entered into an agreement with the other shareholders of the DIPL basis which the directors of  the Company has assessed that it has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of DIPL  unilaterally and therefore APSEZL has control over DIPL.     b)     Group owns 49% ownership interest in Mundra Solar Technopark Private Limited. The Group  took control over business against outstanding receivables from the said entity. The Group also  exercises control over board of the said entity pursuant to a shareholder agreement consequential  to which the Group has accounted it as a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements.     c)     Group  owns  48.97%  ownership  interest  in  Mundra  LPG  Terminal  Private  Limited  ("MLTPL").  Considering the further Investment in equity instrument in April 2022, the Group has obtained  management and operational control of MLTPL and the same has been accounted as subsidiary of  the Group in the consolidated financial statements.     d)     Group owns 30% ownership interest in East Africa Gateway Limited ("EAGL"). Based on the  composition of Board of Directors, the Company has assessed that it has practical ability to direct  and control relevant activities of EAGL and therefore APSEZL has control over EAGL.     e)     Group  owns  28.5%  ownership  interest  in  Tanzania  East  Africa  Gateway  Terminal  Limited  ("TEAGTL"). Based on the composition of Board of Directors, the Company has assessed that it  has practical ability to direct and control relevant activities of TEAGTL and therefore APSEZL has  control over TEAGTL.     (ii)     Investment in entities which are not considered for consolidation         The Group has investment of  `  154.20 crore in Kutch Railway Company Limited ("KRCL"), the investee,  to the tune of the 20% of the paid up capital of the said company. However, considering that majority  of the remaining shares are held by government companies / government authorities / government  agencies, and the day-to day-operations being managed by government officials, the Group does not  consider that it has significant influence over KRCL. Accordingly, the investment in the said entity has  not been accounted under Ind AS 28 and accounted under Ind AS 109 with subsequent measurement  of changes in fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).    (iii)     The group had a control over Adani KP Agri Warehousing Private Limited (“KP Agri”) with a shareholding  of 74%. During the previous year, KP Agri commenced its operations. Considering the understanding  of the Group with other shareholder and the Group’s ability to exercise joint control over KP Agri, the  Group has concluded that it is jointly controlling the same post commencement of its operations and  accordingly the investment in the said entity has been accounted using Equity method as per Ind AS 28.   (B)   Estimates and assumptions       The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions  and  estimates  on  parameters  available  when  the  consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared.  Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market  changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in  the assumptions when they occur.     (i)   Impairment of non-financial assets (including goodwill)         Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable  amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 661 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 costs of disposal calculation is based on available data for similar assets or observable market prices  less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model.  The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years or tenure of contract  and do not  include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments  that will enhance the asset’s performance being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the  discount rate used for the DCF model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate  used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant to goodwill with indefinite useful  lives recognised by the Group. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the  CGU, are disclosed and further explained in note 45.     (ii)   Impairment of financial assets         The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and  expected cash loss. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs  to the impairment calculation, based on Group's past history, existing market conditions as well as  forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.    (iii)   Taxes         Deferred tax assets (including MAT credits) are recognised for unused tax credits to the extent  that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the credits can be utilised.  Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that  can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with  future tax planning strategies. Further details on taxes are disclosed in note 27.     (iv)   Fair value measurement         In measuring the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for financial reporting purpose, the Group  uses market observable data to the extent available. Where such Level 2 inputs are not available, the  Group engages third party qualified valuers to  establish appropriate valuation techniques and inputs  to the model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where  this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions  about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Refer note 34 for  further disclosures.     (v)   Depreciation / amortisation and useful lives of property, plant and equipment / intangible assets         Property, plant and equipment / intangible assets are depreciated / amortised over their estimated  useful lives, after taking into account estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated  useful lives and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation  / amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful lives and residual values are based  on the Group’s historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological  changes. The depreciation / amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes  from previous estimates. (refer note 2.3 (i) & (j))     (vi)   Highly Probable Forecast Sale Transaction designated as hedged item         The Group is applying cash flow hedge accounting as per the Ind AS 109 to hedge it's foreign currency  risk of its highly probable forecast sales transactions. The forecast of foreign currency sale transaction  is an area of judgement applied by Management basis historical trend of growth in cargo and revenue  of the Group.

710 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   (xi)     Asset - Liability Matching Strategies       The Group has purchased insurance policy which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in  which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance  company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year  (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). The policy thus mitigates the liquidity risk.       However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of  liabilities. Thus, the Group is exposed to movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in  interest rates, which should result in a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset). 30   Segment Information   Operating Segments:     The identified reportable Segments are (i) Port and SEZ activities which includes developing, operating and  maintaining  the  Ports  services,  Ports  related  Infrastructure  development  activities  and  development  of  infrastructure at contiguous Special Economic Zone and (ii) others in terms of Ind-AS 108 "Operating Segments"  as notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013.

It is the Group’s policy that  no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken.     The decision of whether and when to execute derivative financial instruments along with its tenure can vary  from period to period depending on market conditions and the relative costs of the instruments. The tenure is  linked to the timing of the underlying exposure with the connection between the two being regularly monitored.  The Group is exposed to losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the derivative contracts.  All derivative contracts are executed with counterparties that, in our judgment, are creditworthy. The outstanding  derivatives are reviewed periodically to ensure that there is no inappropriate concentration of outstanding to any  particular counterparty.     Further, all currency and interest risk as identified above is measured on a daily basis by monitoring the mark  to market (MTM) of open and hedged position. The MTM is derived based on underlying market curves on  closing basis of relevant instrument quoted on Bloomberg/Reuters. For quarter end, the MTM for each derivative  instrument outstanding is obtained from respective banks. All gain / loss arising from MTM for open derivative  contracts and gain / loss on settlement / cancellation / roll over of derivative contracts is recorded in statement  of profit and loss except to the extent of effective portion of instruments designated for hedge accounting.   (A)   Market risk       Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because  of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and  other price risk, such as equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and  borrowings, deposits, FVTOCI investments, short term investments and derivative financial instruments. 34   Financial Instruments, Fair Value Measurements, Financial Risk and Capital Management   (Contd.) 

740 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024.       The sensitivity analysis have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to  floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign  currencies are all constant as at March 31, 2025. The analysis exclude the impact of movements in market  variables on the carrying values of gratuity , other post-retirement obligations and provisions.     The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:      The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective  market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at March 31, 2025 and  March 31, 2024.     (i)    Interest rate risk         The Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates due to financing, investing and cash  management activities. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates  primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates  and period of borrowings.  The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans  and borrowings. The Group enters into interest rate swap contracts or interest rate future contracts to  manage its exposure to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rates.     Interest  rate  sensitivity         The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for  both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate  liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the  reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents  management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.         If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher / lower and all other variables were held constant, the  Group's profit for the year ended March 31, 2025 would decrease / increase by  `  32.66 crore (for the  year ended March 31, 2024 : decrease / increase by  `  13.28  crore). This is mainly attributable to interest  rates on variable rate of long term borrowings. The same has been calculated based on risk exposure  outstanding as on balance sheet date. The year end balances are not necessarily representative of  average debt outstanding during the year.     (ii)    Foreign currency risk         Exchange rate movements, particularly the United States Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JPY), Australian  Dollar (AUD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Arab Emirates Dirham (AED), Euro (EURO), Swiss Franc (CHF) and  Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY) against Indian Rupee (INR), have an impact on the Group’s operating  results. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by entering into currency swap for converting  other foreign currency loan into INR. The Group also enters into various foreign exchange contracts  to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings or  creditors. Further, to hedge foreign currency future transactions in respect of highly probable forecasted  transactions (for instance, foreign exchange denominated income), the Group has designated the  same as hedged item  against USD borrowing which is designated as hedging instrument under  cash flow hedge.         The Group is mainly exposed to changes in USD, EURO, SGD, JPY, AED, AUD, CHF and CNY. The below  table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1% increase or decrease in the respective foreign currency  rates against INR, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis is prepared on the net  unhedged exposure of the Group as at the reporting date. 1% represents management’s assessment of  reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rate.  34   Financial Instruments, Fair Value Measurements, Financial Risk and Capital Management   (Contd.)

742 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Cash Flow Hedge Accounting         The Group’s business objective includes safeguarding its earnings against movement in foreign currency  rates. The Group has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge its foreign currency  risk within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which allows for  Cash Flow hedges.         The Group has opted to apply the hedge accounting, in line with its updated Risk Management  policy, by designating the highly probable forecast revenues (billed in Indian rupees but derived  based on $ denominated tariff rates) as hedged item and non-derivative foreign currency financial  liability of equivalent amount as hedging instrument under Cash Flow Hedge relationship. The Group  has recognized the effective portion of hedge under Other Comprehensive Income, to be ultimately  recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss when underlying forecasted transactions occur. If the  hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting will  be discontinued prospectively. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is  recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.         For hedges of highly probable forecast sales, the Group performs an assessment of effectiveness,  and it is expected that the value of the non-derivative financial instruments and the value of the  corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements  in the underlying exchange rates. The Group uses the dollar offset method for the hedge effectiveness  assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness.         The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of time value of  money resulting due to change in cashflows of hedged item and hedging instruments and difference in  coupon interest rate and discount rate considered for the purpose of designation. No other sources of  ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.       Following are the key estimates and assumptions considered:    Revenue Growth of 6% in FY 26 as well as thereafter.      Interest Rate considered for discounting hedged item ranging from 4.50% to 6.70% basis respective  maturity periods.     1)   Hedge  Effectiveness       There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments as  the terms of the hedge contracts match the terms of hedge items. The Group has established a  hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the foreign exchange are  identical to the hedged risk components.     2)   Hedging  Instrument Particulars Carrying Amount Hedge  Maturity Line Item in  Balance Sheet Assets  Liabilities   ( `  crore) As at March 31, 2025 Foreign Currency Bonds   -      20,180.65  July 2027 to  August 2041 Non-Current  Borrowing 34   Financial Instruments, Fair Value Measurements, Financial Risk and Capital Management   (Contd.)

The Company manages the equity price risk through  diversification and by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments. Reports on the equity  portfolio are submitted to the Company’s senior management on a regular basis. The Company’s Board  of Directors reviews and approves all equity investment decisions.         The Group has given corporate guarantees and pledged part of its investment in equity in order to fulfil  the collateral requirements of the subsidiaries and joint venture entities.

744 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025    (B)   Credit  risk     Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or  customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating  activities (primarily trade receivables and other financial assets) and from its financing activities,  including loans to others, deposits with banks and financial institutions & others, foreign exchange  transactions and other financial assets.     Customer credit risk is managed by the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating  to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive  evaluation and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment.     An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients.  In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for  impairment collectively. The calculation is based on exchange losses historical data.     Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and other counter parties is managed by the  Company’s treasury department in accordance with the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds  are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.  Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the Management of the Company on an annual basis  and may be updated throughout the year subject to approval of the Company’s Finance Committee.  The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through  counterparty’s potential failure to make payments. Corporate Guarantees given to banks and financial institutions against credit facilities availed by the  joint venture entities  `  245.66 crore (Previous year  `  339.29 crore).       Concentrations of Credit Risk form part of Credit Risk Considering that the group operates the port services and provide related infrastructure services, the  group is significantly dependent on cargo from such large port user customer located at various ports.  Out of total revenue, the Group earns 17% revenue (previous year 22%) from such customers and with  some of these customers, the group has long term cargo contracts. Receivables from such customer  constitute 39% of total trade receivables (previous year 38%). A loss of these customer could adversely  affect the operating result or cash flow of the Group.    (C)   Liquidity  Risk     Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments  associated with financial instruments that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.  Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair value.     The Company has an established liquidity risk management framework for managing its short term,  medium term and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company’s exposure  to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities.  The Company manages the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate funds in cash and cash equivalents.  The Company also has adequate credit facilities agreed with banks to ensure that there is sufficient  cash to meet all its normal operating commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner.     The table below analyses derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities of the Company into relevant  maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the reporting date to the contractual maturity  date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. 34   Financial Instruments, Fair Value Measurements, Financial Risk and Capital Management   (Contd.)

During the financial year 2021-22, AVCTPL  and VPT had initiated termination on mutual consent as per right under the concession agreement citing force  majeure events, which went for arbitration. Both the parties have filed the claim with arbitrators and the final  outcome is yet to be decided.     During the financial year 2021-22, the arbitration tribunal, in its interim order, observed that terminal remaining  idle leads to its deterioration and fails to generate any revenue. Hence, terminal should be put to operation without  any delay and has directed VPT to release an ad-hoc interim payment to AVCTPL. Based on such directions, ad-hoc  payment of  `  155 crore had been received against handing over the possession, management and operational  control of the terminal, leaving open all rights and contentions of both parties for examination at a later stage.  Pending final outcome of the ongoing arbitration, the group has classified the terminal assets/liabilities as held  for sale which includes Non-current assets (Including Property, Plant & Equipments and Intangibles)  `  185.40  crore, Inventories  `  1.35 crore and other liabilities  `  47.55 crore.

During the year ended March 31, 2020, due to the disputes between the Company and Customer with respect to  construction, operation and maintenance of the LNG Project, part of the cost has been capitalised in Property,  Plant and Equipment, Interim Settlement and Arbitration Agreement dated December 24, 2019 was executed.  Pursuant thereto,  `  666 crore has been received and arbitration has been invoked by the Company. On July 08,  2020, the Company has filed its claim before Arbitral Tribunal. On October 07, 2020, the customer has also  filed counter claim before Arbitral Tribunal. Pending further developments, no adjustments has been made till  March 31, 2025. 43     The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment  benefits has received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of  India. However, the effective date of the Code is yet to be notified and final rules for quantifying the financial  impact are also yet to be issued. In view of this, the Group will assess the impact of the Code when relevant  provisions are notified and will record related impact, if any, in the period the Code becomes effective. 44     Adani Murmugao Port Terminal Private Limited ("AMPTPL") was undergoing an arbitration with Murmugao Port  Trust ("MPT") for revenue share on deemed storage charges and loss of return of capital to AMPTPL due to failure  of MPT to fulfil obligations as per concession agreement for a period till financial year 2018-19. Post financial  year 2018-19, AMPTPL has received relief in terms of rationalized tariff on storage charges up to March 2020  from authorities.     During the year, the Conciliation and Settlement Committee (CSC) finalized a settlement agreement under the  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. As per the settlement, royalty on storage charges was agreed at 20% of  1% of the Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR). Consequently, the Company has reversed the excess provision of  `  132.35 crore during the current year and disclosed as Reversal of Revenue sharing expense on settlement in  Statement of Profit and Loss. 45   Impairment testing of Goodwill     Goodwill acquired through acquisitions and business combinations pertains to following Cash Generating   Units (CGUs). `  In crore Particulars As at   March 31, 2025 As at   March 31, 2024 The Dhamra Port Company Limited  2,559.31   2,559.31  Adani Kandla Bulk Terminal Private Limited  0.06   0.06  Abbot Point Bulkcoal Pty Limited  2.17   2.18  Adani Harbour Services Limited (Formerly known as The Adani  Harbour Services Limited)  20.53   20.53  Adani Petronet (Dahej) Port Limited  0.22   0.22  Adani Logistics Limited  2.71   2.71  Adinath Polyfills Private Limited  37.42   37.42  Marine Infrastructure Developer Private Limited  143.26   143.26  Adani Agri Logistics Limited and its subsidiaries  455.84   455.84  Dermot Infracon Limited (Formerly known as Dermot Infracon  Private Limited)  0.02   0.02

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the  value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to direct  costs during the year. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market  assessments of the time value of money. The growth rates are based on management's forecasts. Changes in  selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.     The Group prepares its forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by management with  projected revenue growth rates ranging from 5% to 20%.   The rates used to discount the forecasts is 7% to 16% p.a.     Management believes that any reasonable possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the  carrying amount  `  7,093.59 crore (net of deferred tax liability  `  4,521.66 crore) to exceed its recoverable amount. 46    Pursuant to Build, own, operate agreement with Food corporation of India (FCI), subsidiary company Adani Agri  Logistics Limited ("AALL") developed a field depot on leasehold land owned by eastern railways (lessor), upon  expiry of the lease agreement, the lessor could not renew lease agreement and consequently AALL could not  transport food grains at same depot. This resulted in FCI stopping payment for revenues. Accordingly AALL has  stopped recognizing the revenue for the said period.     Now, under PM Gati Shakti framework, the Indian Railway introduced new Policy named “Policy for Management  of Railway Land” dated 04.10.2022, whereby, Railway may grant Railway land on lease to the private entities for  a period of 35 years. The Policy also permitted the existing users to migrate to the new Policy. 45   Impairment testing of Goodwill  (Contd.)

Railway has accepted request of AALL and has extended the land lease for an initial period of 5 years w.e.f.  01.04.2023 which will be extendable by every 5 years upto a maximum of 35 years. Accordingly, the Land Lease  Agreement has been signed between Eastern Railway and Adani Agri Logistics Limited on March 27, 2023.     AALL has submitted letters to FCI and Food Ministry on the above development. FCI has written to Ministry to  grant approval for start of operations in Bandel. During the previous year, operation has been started in Bandel  w.e.f. August, 2023 after due approval from FCI.     The dispute is settled amicably with Eastern Railways at Hooghly depot and successfully extended the land lease  under the new Railway Policy. The Land Lease Agreement with Eastern Railway was signed on 27 th  March 2023,  and AALL initiated operations in Bandel from August 2023 after receiving due approval from FCI. 47     The subsidiary company Adani Agri Logistics Limited ("AALL") had entered into an Agreement with FCI on June 28,  2005 for a concession period of 20 years from “Operations Date”, whereby it was supposed to develop Silo  Terminals with Railway Sidings on BOO basis and procure specialized Rail wagons within 3 years. AALL installed  and commissioned two largest units i.e., Moga (Punjab) and Kaithal (Haryana) having Silos of 200000 MT  capacity each within a period of 2 years in 2007 i.e., much before the deadline of 3 years and put to the service  of FCI. Subsequent units of Navi Mumbai, Hooghly, Chennai, Coimbatore and Bangalore were commissioned in  2008 & 2009. For the delay in execution of these units, AALL had duly paid liquidated damages to FCI as per  the contract terms. One of the obligations to be fulfilled by AALL was to provide certain number of specialized  wagons (i.e., Rakes) to facilitate the bulk movement of food grain stocks from producing areas of Moga and  Kaithal to the consuming areas. Since this was a pilot project and specialized wagons were being introduced for  the first time in India, number of rakes required for the project remained a debatable issue between RITES (the  consultants) and Railway Board. AALL initially procured 260 wagons i.e., 5 rakes. However, FCI insisted for 364  wagons i.e., 7 rakes. Eventually, AALL procured 104 more wagons i.e., two more rakes to make total of 7 rakes  on September 28, 2013. Meanwhile, AALL continued serving FCI to the full capacity during this period. As per  contract, FCI was supposed to give Annual Guaranteed Tonnage (AGT) and WPI based escalation in service  charges. Since FCI considered September 28, 2013 as the actual “Operations date” when the project was 100%  complete, they did not give WPI escalation to AALL for the period from 2007 till September 28, 2013. FCI also did  not give Guaranteed Tonnage for this period. FCI kept this period on Actual Utilization Basis (AUB). Also, FCI kept  the 20 years’ Concession Period from 2007 till 2027. As per Agreement terms, the AGT will be reduced from 100%  to 75% from 11 th  year of operations. Since FCI considered 2007 as first year of operations, the AGT was reduced to  75% from 2017 i.e., 11 th  year of operations. After a series of deliberations and consultations with FCI, the matter  was referred to Arbitration Tribunal, AALL prayed as follows:   a)      FCI should pay WPI based escalation from 2007 as AALL had been providing uninterrupted services to FCI  since beginning. WPI is kept to absorb inflation irrespective of the fact that the unit was on AGT or AUB.   b)      Alternatively, if FCI considers September 28, 2013 as “Operations Date”, the 20 years’ Concession Period  should be fixed from 2013 till 2033.     On 2 nd  October, 2021 Arbitral Award was pronounced in the favor of company, as per the award Service Period in  terms of Clause 4.1 of the Service Agreement (20 years) must be reckoned from 28.09.2013 as a result of which  company's concession period has been extended by 6 years upto 2033. Further FCI has filed appeal against the  Arbitral Award in High Court. Matter is pending before Delhi High Court. Honourable Delhi High Court has given  their verdict in favour of AALL dated December 22, 2023 by stating that COD date would be 28.09.2013.     Again FCI challenged the Honourable High court verdict in Honourable Supreme court and Now, the matter is  currently pending before Honourable Supreme court. 46   (Contd.)

Resolution Item No.9 : Particulars of material  related party transactions to be entered with  Mediterranean International Ports A.D.G.D.  Limited. Background and rationale of the transaction: The Company along with the joint venture partner  Gadot Chemical Terminals (1985) Ltd. (“Gadot”) has  incorporated Mediterranean International Ports A.D.G.D  Ltd (“MIPAL”) for acquiring 100% stake of Haifa Port  Company, Israel (“HPC”). To consummate the acquisition, MIPAL was  funded as under:  Particulars NIS* in Million Equity funding (30%) (Funded by both  APSEZ & Gadot in 70:30 ratio) 1,239 Loan from Bank Mizrahi (“MTB”) 1,100 Loan from Adani International Ports  Holdings Pte Ltd, wholly owned  subsidiary of APSEZ (“AIPH”) 1,672 Total Funding at MIPAL 4,011 Purchase price of HPC paid by MIPAL 3,975 Note: Current interest rate on MTB loan is 8.65% and on  AIPH loan is 7.25%. *NIS – Israeli New Shekel The above ‑ mentioned term loan facilities were availed  by MIPAL for shorter durations (2 to 3 years), solely for  the purpose of funding the acquisition of Haifa Port  Company. As these loans are now coming up for maturity,  MIPAL proposes to refinance such loans for a longer  duration of 7 years. Refinancing the existing debt at MIPAL: •     The existing loan from MTB of NIS 1,100 million is  due for repayment by June 2025, pursuant to which,  

822 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE LIMITED the same is getting refinanced by MTB to the extent of NIS 830 million for a period of 7 years (i.e., till May 2032)  at interest ranging from 7.45% to 7.85% (benchmarked to the Bank of Israel rate / applicable Bond rate in Israel). •   The remaining amount of NIS 270 million will be given by AIPH to MIPAL on the same terms as MTB loan. •     As the security offered for the proposed loan is the shares of HPC, no corporate guarantee is required from the  shareholders due to which this will be non-recourse financing at MIPAL. •     The terms and conditions of refinancing offer a grace period in principal repayments for the first 4 years and  thereafter small repayments in the 5 th  and 6 th  year leading to average maturity of loan ~ 6.5 years. •     Further, the refinancing terms offers the rate of interest ranging from 7.45% to 7.85% (lower than the current  interest rate of 8.65%) which leads to a reduction of finance costs at MIPAL. At the same time, the above interest  rate will leave a margin at AIPH (considering AIPH’s existing cost of funding) and thereby ensure an arm’s length  transaction between AIPH and MIPAL. •     The term of refinancing enables both MTB as well as AIPH to down-sell their respective loan exposure over the  tenor of loan by bringing other Israeli banks / Financial Institutions / International banks. •     Considering the ongoing situation in Israel and consequential effects in its financial markets, the above terms of  refinancing offered by MTB seems optimal. In case, closure to the refinancing, if AIPH loan is more commercially  beneficial as compared to MTB loan, APSEZ/ AIPH may fund NIS 830 million to MIPAL. •     The equity infusion by APSEZ in MIPAL, will be done basis the valuation report from Independent valuer as per  applicable law.

As of FY25, MIPAL has no revenue from operations. 6 Details of the transaction relating to any loans, intercorporate deposits, advances or investments made or given  by the listed entity or its subsidiary: a) Details of the source of funds in connection  with the proposed transaction The existing AIPH loan of NIS 1,672 million is already provided  and ongoing at MIPAL. The refinancing of this existing loan does  not envisage any actual repayment / disbursement but only be a  revision of the terms and elongation of its tenor to 7 years. The additional loan of NIS 270 million will be given by AIPH out of  its own funds / bank limits. b) Where  any  financial  indebtedness  is incurred to make or give loans,  intercorporate deposits, advances or  investments: ‑  Nature of indebtedness, ‑  Cost of funds, and ‑  Tenure AIPH already has its own funds of ~USD 80 million (more than  NIS 270 million) which can be utilized to provide the additional  loan of NIS 270 million to MIPAL. Alternatively, AIPH can utilize  its existing bank limits for providing such loan. If such bank limits  are utilized, the cost of the funds will be 0.40% (40 basis points)  above the prevailing interest rates on the fixed deposits of equal  amount parked by AIPH in the respective bank.

Resolution Item No.10 : Particulars of material related party transactions to be entered with Colombo  West International Terminal (Private) Limited, Joint venture of Adani International Ports Holdings Pte  Ltd, Singapore. Background and rationale of the transaction: The Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, Adani International Ports Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore (“AIPH”) is  holding 51% stake in Colombo West International Terminal (Private) Limited, Sri Lanka (“CWIT”) and the balance stake  of CWIT is held by John Keells Holdings (“JKH”) of Sri Lanka (34%) and Sri Lanka Port Authority (15%) (‘SLPA”) for  development of West Container Terminal – 1 (“WCT ‑ 1” / “the Project”) at Colombo Port in Sri Lanka. CWIT has signed a BOT agreement with SLPA for the development of WCT ‑ 1/Project at the Port of Colombo, for a  concession period of 35 years (including construction period), at a total Project cost of ~ USD 851 million. The proposed  funding for this Project is to be arranged with debt of USD 603 million (includes working capital debt) and equity USD  248 million (includes internal accruals). Current Status: •     CWIT has announced the commencement of operations of Phase 1 of the Project on April 7, 2025, in line with  BOT agreement timelines.     The phase 1 of the Project has been completed with a capital expenditure of USD 328 million, which was  funded through a mix of debt (Adani: USD 113 million + Local Sri Lankan Bank: USD 48 million) and equity of  USD   167   million (Adani: USD 85 million, JKH: USD 57 million and SLPA: USD 25 million). •     For achieving the full commercial operation, the Project would require additional capital expenditure of USD  523 million. The said requirement would be funded through debt from Adani (i.e., by APSEZ via AIPH) of USD  440 million; equity of USD 67 million (Adani: USD 34 million, JKH: USD 23 million and SLPA: USD 10 million) and  internal accruals of USD 16 million. 

Notice 825 Compliance with BOT Agreement: •     In compliance with the BOT agreement and for achievement of financial closure of the Project, APSEZ / AIPH  have agreed to provide USD 553 million as a debt at SOFR+425 bps. •     Since AIPH owns 51% stake in CWIT, the entire debt at CWIT would be consolidated at APSEZ and hence, offering  such financial support would not add to APSEZ’s gross debt. •     As per the condition of Board of Investments, Sri Lanka, CWIT being classified as Strategic Development Project,  APSEZ is required to bring in USD 455 million by September, 2026 as Foreign Direct Investment (“FDI”) in Sri Lanka. •     Till March 31, 2025, AIPH has invested USD 198 million (Equity: USD 85 million and Loan: USD 113 million) as FDI in  WCT ‑ 1 and is on track to provide the balance amount which would go towards achievement of Project completion. •     Over FY26 and FY27, APSEZ has to further infuse USD 474 million (Equity: USD 34 million and Loan: USD 440  million) towards completion of Project. Related Party arm’s length assessment: •     CWIT has approached various Sri Lankan as well as international banks / financial institutions to explore the  possibility of debt raise. The interest rate offered by such local / international institution ranges between  SOFR+3.50% (for short term loan) and SOFR+4.25% (for long term loan). •     As the loan given by AIPH to CWIT will be long term in nature, AIPH will charge an interest rate of SOFR+425 bps  which is equivalent to the interest rate offered by external banks / financial institutions to CWIT. •     AIPH on the other hand is raising the loan at SOFR+ ~200 bps giving itself a net interest margin (pre ‑ tax) of ~225  bps, which on a post ‑ tax basis is ~185 bps. •   As AIPH is earning the market differential on interest rate (NIM), the same meets the related party arm’s length test.

Background and rationale of the transaction: •     Adani Harbour Services Limited (“AHSL”) is a wholly owned subsidiary ("WOS") of the Company. In FY 2024 ‑ 25,  AHSL, through its WOS, The Adani Harbour International DMCC ("TAHID") incorporated  a special purpose  vehicle named Sunrise Worldwide Enterprise Limited (“SWEL”) in British Virgin Islands, in which TAHID owns 80%  equity and erstwhile promoters of Astro owns 20% equity through M&A holdings Group Limited, British Virgin  Islands (“M&A”). 

Notice 827 •   In October 2024, SWEL acquired 100% stake in global OSV operator Astro Offshore Pte Limited (“Astro”). •     Further, pursuant to composite scheme of arrangement, which is in process, the marine business undertaking  (including investment) of AHSL will be demerged and vested into Shanti Sagar International Dredging Limited  (“SSIDL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. •    About Astro:  An offshore marine services operator, owning 40 vessels including 12 barges, 20 anchor handler  tugs, 3 work boats, 1 multi ‑ purpose supply vessels, 3 shoalbuster and 1 platform supply vessel. They also do 3 rd   party chartering business wherein they lease vessels from other parties and offers to end clients. •     Post acquisition in October 2024 till March 31, 2025, TAHID has invested additional USD 89 million in Astro’s  organic growth ambitions of expanding footprint by adding new vessels to its fleet. •     The shareholders of Astro are committed to provide funding support through equity infusion, debt, and other  instruments for the strategic growth of Astro. Astro's Expansion Plan: •     Astro's strategic expansion plan for FY2026 has a mix of organic and inorganic growth. While organic growth  includes expansion of global footprint, addition of young, high spec and versatile fleet and increase the customer  base, Astro is strategically expanding into service support vessels for the Tier 1 customer base which are Global  Oil Majors in addition to the current EPC contractors that require larger and more sophisticated technical  solutions such as more advanced and larger vessels with comprehensive services solutions for Offshore support.  These potential customers are offering longer term contracts as commitments against higher capex investments.  Operational synergies will be achieved through leveraging on economies of scale, reducing costs, and optimizing  fleet utilization. •     Astro is focusing on diversifying its segments and enhancing its services and aims to enter new areas such  as rig support services, subsea maintenance and diving services and offshore wind farm logistics, leveraging  global shifts in energy demand. As part of expansion process, Astro is exploring new opportunities in different  geographies including Australia, Southeast Asia, Africa and South America, while consolidating its presence  in Middle east. •     Geographic expansion is another critical focus of Astro's plan and intends to target emerging markets in Australia,  South America, Caribbeans, Southeast Asia, and Africa, while strengthening its presence in the Middle East.  This will involve regional acquisitions, the establishment of local partnerships, and investments in regional offices. •     Astro has ambitious inorganic growth plans through identification and acquisition of credible companies in the  targeted segment / markets, strategic tie ups for entry into specific regions and fleet sale opportunities which  aids in exponential growth. Funding Requirement: •     The capital expenditure required for Astro's above mentioned expansion plan/ initiatives are estimated at  USD   325   million, which will be funded through a mix of internal accruals and debt either from the Company  and/ or AHSL and/or SSIDL into TAHID for onward funding to SWEL/to Astro during the current financial year  i.e. FY26. This capex allocation will cover fleet modernization, technology upgrades, and strategic acquisitions  in new segments and regions. Astro’s balanced approach combines sustainable organic growth with strategic  acquisitions to rapidly scale its operations while ensuring long ‑ term value creation •     Since proposed funding will be a related party transaction in nature, TAHID will charge an interest rate of  SOFR+350 bps which will meet the related party arm’s length assessment.
