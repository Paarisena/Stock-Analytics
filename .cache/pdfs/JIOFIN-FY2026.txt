MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN Dear Shareholders, The current global environment is marked by  macroeconomic uncertainties, especially with geopolitical  volatility  and  the  ongoing  trade  and  tariff-related  developments.  Despite  these  concerns,  the  Indian  economy is expected to maintain its strong trajectory,  with the GDP expected to grow at about 6.5% in FY26.  With India poised to become a $5 trillion economy   in the near future, the sustained economic expansion is  poised to drive significant demand for all forms of financial  services.  A large and vibrant consumption market, a wave of enabling  policy reforms, a wealth of talent and rapid embrace of  new technology are India’s inherent strengths that provide  us a robust foundation for this growth.  Fuelled by technological innovation, the financial services  sector  has  undergone  a  profound  transformation,  as  digital  platforms  now  effortlessly  bridge  the  gap   between service providers and consumers — both rural  and urban — at a fraction of the cost.  The  rise  of  fintechs  underscores  the  importance   of agility and resilience as fundamental drivers for a  sustainable  financial  services  model.  Next-generation  technology,  especially  the  evolving  world  of  Artificial  Intelligence (AI), will be a key enabler in ensuring this  adaptability and strength. New branches of AI, such as Agentic AI, which is capable  of autonomous action and decision-making, hold immense  potential to define the future of this industry. It can power  hyper-personalised financial advice, automate complex  back-office operations and detect fraud with unparalleled  accuracy, driving efficiency as well as enhanced customer  experience.  For India, this technology can be a game-changer, driving  greater financial access with tailored solutions on intuitive  digital platforms that are easy to navigate. By leveraging  Agentic AI, we can break down traditional barriers, making  financial services more accessible and affordable to a  wider population. One must also remember that the business of financial  services is premised on trust. So, even as we harness  the full potential of technology to make financial services  more experiential and efficient, we must remain mindful of  safeguarding customer data and privacy by making the  necessary investments in cybersecurity measures.  At Jio Financial Services, we are committed to leveraging  new technology as a force for good by simplifying financial  services and expanding access. By embracing technology,  Jio Financial Services is uniquely positioned to become  a premier financial services enterprise, catering to the  evolving aspirations of our customers.  FY25  was  a  transformative  year  for  your  Company,  characterised by significant investments in our core: people,  processes, products and technology. In FY26, I am confident  that we will capitalise on this strong foundation to bring  intuitive and innovative products and services to Indians at  scale. As we do so, we will maintain an unequivocal focus on  governance and risk management to grow sustainably and  responsibly.  I express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders for their  continued support and trust. Sincerely, K. V. Kamath Chairman Transformation through technology  New branches of AI which are  capable of autonomous action and  decision-making, hold immense  potential to define this industry’s  future.

Payment Solutions and Payment Banks India’s payments industry continues to evolve rapidly in step with  the growing economy, driven by advancements in digital payment  solutions and the expanding role of payments banks. The country’s  digital payments ecosystem has experienced robust growth, fuelled  by the widespread adoption of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)  and a broadening suite of digital payment alternatives. During  FY25,  UPI  volumes  exceeded  186  billion  transactions,  with the total transaction value surpassing ₹261 lakh crore. UPI  now contributes ~80% of all retail payments. According to PwC’s  The Indian Payments Handbook - 2024-2029 , the value of digital  payment transactions is projected to grow to ₹577 lakh crore by  FY29, with UPI alone expected to account for ₹483 lakh crore.  Daily UPI transactions are forecasted to reach 1.4 billion by FY29,  highlighting the deepening penetration and adoption of digital  payments across the country. Payments banks continue to support financial inclusion, a focus  reinforced by government initiatives such as the  Pradhan Mantri  Jan Dhan Yojana  (PMJDY) and the Digital India programme. PMJDY  has expanded the formal banking customer base by furthering  financial inclusion, while Digital India has strengthened the digital  infrastructure and promoted digital literacy nationwide. These  initiatives, in turn, enable payment banks to better serve previously  underserved  and  unbanked  populations,  driving  transaction  volumes, customer acquisition and sectoral expansion.  Insurance Broking According  to  the  Economic  Survey  2024-25,  India’s  insurance  industry  grew  7.7%  year-on-year  to  ₹11.2  lakh  crore  in  FY24,  with life insurance comprising nearly 75% of the total market.  However, insurance penetration declined to 3.7% in FY24 from 4%  in FY23, significantly below the global average of 7%, highlighting  considerable growth potential.  Government initiatives, including the  Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti  Bima Yojana  (PMJJBY),  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  (PMFBY)  and  Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana  (PMJAY), are widening  insurance  access.  Regulatory  efforts  such  as  the  Insurance  Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s (IRDAI) ‘Insurance  for All’ vision, reforms in policy and claims processing and the  recent increase in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) cap to 100%  are expected to strengthen investor confidence and capital inflows.  The upcoming unified digital platform Bima Sugam is also set to  streamline digital access to insurance products. Insurance broking is expected to grow steadily, driven by increasing  public awareness, an evolving regulatory environment and the  accelerating adoption of digital technologies across the financial  ecosystem. Asset Management, Wealth Management  and Broking Retail investor participation in India’s capital markets has witnessed  a notable surge post-pandemic, driven by the rise of both direct  equity trading and Mutual Fund investments. According to the  Economic Survey 2024-25, India had 11.5 crore unique demat  account holders and 5.6 crore unique Mutual Fund investors as of  December 2024, reflecting deepening financial market penetration.  This  growth  is  underpinned  by  an  expanding  economy,  rising  disposable  incomes  and  growing  financial  literacy,  particularly  among affluent and high-net-worth individuals seeking professional  wealth management services.  The Mutual Fund industry continues to expand at a healthy pace.  As of March 31, 2025, Assets Under Management (AUM) registered  strong year-on-year growth of 23% to ₹65.7 lakh crore, while  Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows during FY25 rose 45%  year-on-year to ₹2.9 lakh crore from ₹2.0 lakh crore in the previous  year. Under the Viksit Bharat 2047 vision, the Association of Mutual  Funds in India (AMFI) is targeting a sharp increase in retail mutual  fund penetration—from 3.6% in 2025 to ~15% by 2047. Technology is playing a pivotal role in reshaping wealth management  and broking. The adoption of robo-advisory platforms, algorithm- driven investment solutions and automated portfolio management  tools is transforming client engagement and service delivery.  These digital platforms offer cost-effective, transparent investment  options and cater to the evolving preferences of a new generation  of investors. According to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP’s  report  titled  ‘Financial  Wealth  Management  Services  in  India’,  the wealth management industry in India presents a $1.6 trillion  opportunity between FY24 and FY29, underscoring the sector’s  growth potential. Business Update Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL) continues to advance its  mission of democratising access to financial services through a  digital-first approach. At the heart of this strategy is our  JioFinance  app , which serves as the central platform for JFSL’s retail offerings.

Management Discussion and Analysis JFSL Annual Report FY25 Company Overview   Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL), formerly known as Reliance  Strategic  Investments  Limited,  is  a  Core  Investment  Company  –  Non-Deposit  Taking  –  Systemically  Important  (CIC-ND-SI),  registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under Corporate  Identity No. L65990MH1999PLC120918. Incorporated on July 22,  1999, in Mumbai, JFSL serves as the holding company for the  Group’s financial services businesses. Operating through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and Associates,  JFSL addresses the four core financial needs of customers: The  need to borrow, invest, transact and protect. The Company’s subsidiaries include: l   J io Credit Limited (formerly Jio Finance Limited) l   J io Leasing Services Limited (formerly Jio Information  Aggregator Services Limited) l   J io Insurance Broking Limited (formerly Reliance Retail  Insurance Broking Limited) l   J io Payment Solutions Limited (formerly Reliance Payment  Solutions Limited) l   J io Finance Platform and Service Limited Its joint ventures comprise: l   J io Payments Bank Limited (a joint venture with State Bank  of India) l   R eliance International Leasing IFSC Limited (a joint venture  between Jio Leasing Services Limited and Reliance  Strategic Business Ventures Limited) l   J io BlackRock Asset Management Private Limited and  Jio  BlackRock  Trustee  Private  Limited  (joint  ventures  with BlackRock Financial Management Inc. for the asset  management business) l   J ioBlackRock Investment Advisers Private Limited (a joint  venture with BlackRock Advisors Singapore Pte. Ltd. for  wealth management) l   J io BlackRock Broking Private Limited (a wholly-owned  subsidiary of JioBlackRock Investment Advisers Private  Limited for broking services) Macroeconomic Overview The  global  economy  demonstrated  resilience  through  FY25,  despite moderating activity, policy uncertainty and geopolitical  tensions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected global  GDP growth at 3.2% for both 2024 and 2025, indicating steady but  moderate expansion. India remained the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) projected real GDP growth at 6.5%  for FY26, mirroring FY25 levels, supported by robust investments,  public consumption and increasing formalisation. The IMF expects  India to become a $5 trillion economy by FY28 and reach $6.3  trillion by FY30. Inflation dynamics improved during the year. Headline Consumer  Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 3.3% in March 2025, driven by  softening food and beverage prices. For FY25, retail inflation stood  at 4.6% vs 5.4% in FY24 and is projected to be 4% in FY26. Reflecting a comfortable inflation outlook, the MPC initiated its first  repo rate cut since 2020, reducing the rate by 25 basis points to  6.25% in February 2025, followed by a similar cut to 6% in April  2025. India’s financial stability indicators remained healthy. According  to the RBI’s December 2024 Financial Stability Report, household  debt rose to 42.9% of GDP as of June 2024, a modest figure relative  to emerging market peers. Growth was attributed primarily to a  wider borrower base, with asset-backed loans among super-prime  borrowers maintaining overall credit quality and systemic resilience. Industry Overview  Technology continues to be the life-force reshaping the Indian  financial  services  landscape.  The  rise  of  fintech  ecosystems,  the proliferation of digital lending platforms and the integration  of advanced technologies — including Artificial Intelligence (AI),  Machine Learning (ML) and data analytics — have fundamentally  transformed the manner in which financial services are delivered,  accessed and consumed.  These innovations have driven notable improvements in operational  efficiency,  reduced  customer  acquisition,  servicing  costs  and  meaningfully broadened access to financial products, particularly  for underserved segments. Government-led initiatives such as the  Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and the Open Network  for Digital Commerce (ONDC) have further accelerated this digital  transformation by strengthening the underlying infrastructure and  enabling greater interoperability across platforms.  As the regulatory environment continues to evolve to balance  innovation  with  consumer  protection,  financial  institutions  are  deepening  their  investment  in  digital  capabilities,  including  cybersecurity measures. Non-Banking Financial Companies  (NBFCs) — traditionally known for their agility — are at the forefront  of leveraging technology to achieve faster turnaround times and  enhanced customer experiences and journeys. Banks are similarly  intensifying  their  digital  transformation  efforts,  building  steady  momentum in digitising their product and service offerings. The  ongoing  convergence  of  technology  and  financial  services  is  expected to remain a key catalyst for sectoral growth, fostering  wider  financial  services  accessibility,  product  innovation  and  operational resilience. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) NBFCs continue to play a vital role in driving financial inclusion and  supporting economic growth by offering tailored financial products  to underserved customer segments. New-age NBFCs have  sustained competitiveness through lean operations, rapid digital  adoption, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics to  improve efficiency and risk management. During the first half of FY25, NBFC sector credit growth moderated  to 16% year-on-year, compared to 18.5% in FY24, following the  Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to raise risk weights on  certain categories of unsecured consumer credit. A key emerging risk for the sector is the increasing incidence of  borrowers availing multiple personal loans despite existing debt  obligations, raising concerns about delinquencies in unsecured  lending portfolios. Initially, the RBI tightened funding access for  NBFCs by raising bank exposure risk weights. However, recognising  the need to balance credit growth, it reversed this decision effective  April 1, 2025, improving NBFCs’ access to funding and potentially  lowering borrowing costs. Within the lending landscape, housing finance continues to be  a major growth driver. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding  individual housing loans grew 14% year-on-year to ₹33.5 lakh crore.  CareEdge Ratings projects the housing loan market to expand to  ~₹81 lakh crore over the next five years, underscoring robust long- term demand.

The Company maintains a unified risk and control approach to  ensure consistent governance across the group and remains  committed to strengthening its control systems in alignment with  evolving regulatory guidelines and supervisory expectations. Human Capital  In a rapidly evolving business landscape defined by technological  advancement and changing talent expectations, JFSL is building  a future-ready workforce aligned with its vision to create India’s  premier  financial  services  institution.  The  Company’s  people  strategy is anchored on the belief that human capital is its most  valuable asset, with initiatives designed to foster a sustainable,  agile and innovation-driven organisation. Three strategic pillars support this commitment: l    C  apability Development: Continuous investment in  employee growth through rigorous assessments and  focused upskilling, enabling the workforce to navigate the  complexities of a dynamic financial services environment. l    C  ulture of Innovation and Inclusion: A workplace culture  that  encourages  innovation,  psychological  safety  and  inclusivity, positioning JFSL as an employer of choice and  ensuring employee well-being and engagement. l   S trategic Collaboration: Cross-functional partnerships that  enhance internal synergies and deliver seamless, customer- centric financial solutions across access, affordability and  prosperity. As of FY25, JFSL’s team comprises over 1,000 professionals, drawn  from diverse backgrounds across gender, experience, industries  and geographies. These principles drive JFSL’s efforts to build a  truly talent-intensive organisation that supports sustainable growth  and long-term stakeholder value creation. Enterprise Risk Management  JFSL operates within a dynamic risk landscape across its  subsidiaries,  managing  exposures  that  include  credit,  market,  liquidity, operational, strategic, fraud, model and digital risks. A  comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework  underpins the Company’s approach, ensuring that risk identification,  assessment,  mitigation  and  monitoring  are  embedded  into  all  strategic and operational activities. Risks are identified through  proactive self-evaluation exercises and data analytics, followed  by rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments. Mitigation  strategies, including diversification, insurance and the institution of  robust internal controls, are implemented to limit impact. The ERM framework is aligned with JFSL’s risk appetite and  strategic objectives and is governed through a clear, multi-layered  structure that defines stakeholder roles and responsibilities. This  ensures risk considerations are fully integrated into decision- making across investment, policy and operational domains.  Automation tools enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of risk  monitoring, while the Company’s disaster recovery and business  continuity  plans,  built  on  detailed  impact  analyses,  safeguard  critical operations in the event of unforeseen disruptions. Through  continuous  monitoring,  reporting  and  adaptation,  the  ERM  framework ensures that risk levels are maintained within acceptable  thresholds, supporting JFSL’s long-term resilience and stability. Opportunities and Threats  India’s financial services sector remains a key engine of economic  growth, supported by favourable demographics, rising disposable  incomes and a growing culture of savings and investment. Rapid  adoption of digital channels — including mobile banking, wallets  and UPI — has widened financial inclusion, while government  initiatives promoting a cashless economy and fintech innovation  have accelerated this transformation. As penetration deepens across Tier II and Tier III cities, a significant  untapped market continues to emerge, offering compelling growth  opportunities  for  financial  service  providers.  New-age  players,  including  NBFCs,  payments  banks  and  insurance  brokers,  are  well-positioned to meet evolving customer needs through agile,  technology-led models. Rising smartphone usage and digital  infrastructure improvements are expected to sustain momentum  across the sector. At the same time, the increasing digitisation of financial services has  heightened cybersecurity risks, necessitating stronger frameworks  to protect customer data and safeguard trust. Regulatory  scrutiny around consumer protection, systemic stability and risk  management is likely to increase, introducing new compliance  demands. In addition, global macroeconomic challenges, including  inflationary  pressures,  monetary  policy  shifts  and  geopolitical  uncertainties, could impact credit demand and investment flows. Unlocking the full potential of the sector will require continued  investment in digital infrastructure, greater financial literacy and  resilient, transparent regulatory practices. Strategic collaboration  between  policymakers,  financial  institutions  and  technology  providers will also be essential to drive sustainable innovation and  maintain sector resilience. Segment- and Product-wise Updates  JFSL is primarily engaged in investing and financing activities in  India. In accordance with Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments, the  Company operates a single reportable segment and does not  have any separate business or geographical segments requiring  disclosure. Outlook JFSL was established to capitalise on India’s vast financial services  opportunities by innovating and democratising access to new-age  financial solutions. Over the past year, the Company has focused  on building core infrastructure and execution capabilities across  key business verticals. In FY26, the focus will shift towards scaling  operations, enhancing efficiency and driving sustainable, profitable  growth. A major priority will be establishing a strong presence across  asset  management,  wealth  management  and  broking  through  the joint venture with BlackRock. JFSL is also expanding its data  analytics capabilities and leveraging access to a large and diverse  customer base to deliver hyper-personalised financial solutions. By  integrating advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence  and  predictive  analytics,  the  Company  aims  to  offer  the  right  products to the right customers through the right channels at the  right time, optimising engagement and delivering long-term value. As a digital-first institution, JFSL is uniquely positioned to harness  emerging technologies to enhance operational capabilities and  customer  experience.  The  Company  remains  committed  to  bridging the gap between aspiration and access, ensuring that  every Indian is empowered with the financial tools needed to thrive  in an increasingly digital economy. Risk and Concerns  JFSL’s  core  business  operations  are  concentrated  in  India,  making its performance sensitive to the country’s prevailing  macroeconomic conditions. Political, economic and legal factors,  as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, could  materially impact the Company’s operating environment. Given  JFSL’s dependence on interest income and net interest margin,  movements in interest rates — influenced by the Reserve Bank  of India’s monetary policies, inflationary trends and domestic and  international developments — remain a key area of sensitivity. The  ability to pass on increased interest costs to borrowers depends on  their willingness and the intensity of market competition.  JFSL may obtain funding or lend through both fixed and floating  interest rates. The Company’s asset-liability management strategy  aims to prevent excessive imbalances in its financial position. The Company’s business and financial results are also exposed to  regulatory risks. Adverse changes to existing laws, the introduction  of new regulations or shifts in regulatory interpretations could  impose additional operational conditions, licensing requirements  or approval obligations. Such changes may affect JFSL’s cost  structures and operating flexibility.  Further,  any  downgrade  in  India’s  sovereign  credit  ratings  by  domestic or international rating agencies could impact JFSL’s  access to financing or alter the commercial terms of such funding.  This, in turn, could affect the Company’s growth plans, financial  performance and overall shareholder value. Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy  The Company, as a registered Core Investment Company (CIC) under  RBI’s Master Direction for CICs, has established a comprehensive  and  group-wide  internal  control  and  financial  governance  framework. This framework is aligned with the requirements of  the Companies Act, 2013, RBI regulations and the components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), and other applicable  laws to ensure robust risk management, asset protection, financial  accuracy, and regulatory compliance across the Company along  with its subsidiaries, joint ventures and Associates. Internal financial controls have been embedded into key business  processes across group—regulated and unregulated—ensuring  that all transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded, and  reported. The Company adheres to applicable Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) for maintaining books of account and financial  reporting. The internal control environment is continuously monitored through: l   M anagement oversight and periodic self-assessments, l   R isk-based internal audits conducted by independent audit  teams in line with regulatory expectations for the Company.  l   F unction-level control monitoring within each subsidiary,  and l   O ngoing compliance tracking across operational, financial,  and regulatory domains. The Audit Committee of the Company, which has oversight over  group-level internal controls, meets periodically to review: l   T he  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  internal  financial  controls across all entities, l   S tatus  of  compliance  with  internal  policies,  standard  operating procedures, and applicable regulatory guidelines, l   I mplementation of audit findings and corrective actions  across  the  CIC,  its  subsidiaries,  Joint  Ventures  and  Associates FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW 72 73 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25

At the heart of our corporate governance philosophy are our six core values: Customer Value, Ownership Mindset, Respect, Integrity,  One Team and Excellence. These values guide our actions and decisions, ensuring that we prioritise our customers’ needs, encourage  accountability and proactive decision-making among our employees, foster a culture of mutual respect, uphold the highest standards of  ethical behaviour, work collaboratively towards our goals and continually strive for excellence in all our endeavours. Our commitment to governance is reflected in our continuous efforts to build and refine processes and systems that enhance our governance  framework. We are dedicated to institutionalising best practices and setting up robust systems that ensure accountability, transparency and  fairness in all our transactions. We believe that good corporate governance is a journey of continuous improvement.

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  valuation  of  investment  in  two  subsidiaries (i.e. Jio Payment Solutions Limited and Jio Leasing  Services Limited) has been identified as a Key Audit Matter.

This responsibility  also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in  accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets  of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other  irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate  internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that  give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the standalone financial statements, management and  Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s  ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,  matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate  the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative  but to do so.  The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing  the Company’s financial reporting process.  Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the  standalone  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue  an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or  error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial  statements.  As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  the  SAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgement  and  maintain  professional  skepticism  throughout the audit. We also: •   I dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the  standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,  design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,  and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •   O btain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we  are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the  Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference  to standalone financial statements in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls.  •   E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by the management. •    C  onclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the  going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt  on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we  conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to  draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures  in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on  the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to  cease to continue as a going concern. •   E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  standalone  financial  statements,  including  the  disclosures,  and whether the standalone financial statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair  presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone  financial  statements  that,  individually  or  in  aggregate,  makes  it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably  knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may  be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative  factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating  the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified  misstatements in the standalone financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding,  among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit  and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies  in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.  We also provide those charged with governance with a statement  that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding  independence, and to communicate with them all relationships  and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most  significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the  current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe  these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation  precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely  rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be  communicated in our report because the adverse consequences  of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication.

NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 A.    C  orporate information Jio Financial Services Limited (“the Company”), with Corporate  ID No. (CIN L65990MH1999PLC120918), was incorporated as  a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956  with the name and style of ‘Reliance Strategic Investments  Private  Limited’  and  a  certificate  of  incorporation  dated  July 22, 1999, was issued by the Registrar of Companies,  Maharashtra at Mumbai. Subsequently, the Company was  converted from a private limited company to a public limited  company and consequently renamed as ‘Reliance Strategic  Investments Limited’ and a fresh certificate of incorporation  dated  January  14,  2002,  was  issued  by  the  Registrar  of  Companies, Maharashtra at Mumbai.  Pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement (as defined in note 29),  the name of the Company has been changed to Jio Financial  Services Limited and a fresh certificate of incorporation dated  July 25, 2023 was issued by the Registrar of Companies,  Maharashtra at Mumbai. The Company is a registered Non-Banking Financial Company  - Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Company as  defined under section 45-IA of the Reserve Bank of India Act,  1934 with effect from December 31, 1999 having registration  number 13.01327. The registered office of the company is  located at 1 st  Floor, Building 4NA, Maker Maxity, Bandra Kurla  Complex, Bandra (East), Mumbai, Maharashtra 400051, India.  The Company is considered an NBFC- Middle layer (NBFC- ML) pursuant to RBI Scale Based regulations. In accordance with RBI approval of the change in control and  shareholding as per the Scheme of Arrangement, the company  had met the required eligibility criteria for classification as a  Core Investment Company (CIC). Pursuant to the certificate of  registration and approval received from the Reserve Bank of  India (RBI) on July 9, 2024, the Company has been classified as  a Non-Deposit Taking Systemically Important Core Investment  Company (CIC-NO-SI) with effect from that date. The equity shares of the Company were listed on the Bombay  Stock  Exchange  (BSE)  and  the  National  Stock  Exchange  (NSE), India, effective August 21, 2023.  B.   B asis of preparation B.1   S tatement of compliance The Standalone financial statements of Company have been  prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards  (Ind AS) as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, (as amended from time to time) and notified  under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (referred to  as “the Act”) along with other relevant provisions of the Act,  the Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking  Financial Company – Scale Based Regulation) Directions, 2023  (as amended from time to time) and other guidelines issued  by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as applicable and amended  from time to time and other accounting principles generally  accepted in India. The Company uses the accrual basis of  accounting in preparation of financial statements (other than  Statement of Cash Flows). The financial statements have been  prepared and presented on the going concern basis.  The  accounting  policies  have  been  consistently  applied,  except in cases where a newly issued Ind AS is initially adopted  or when a revision to an existing Ind AS required a change in  the accounting policy previously in use. The Standalone financial statements have been approved by  the Company’s Board of Directors and authorised for issue on  April 17, 2025. B.2   P resentation of standalone financial  statements The standalone balance sheet, standalone statement of profit  and loss and standalone statement of changes in equity  adhere to the format prescribed in Division III of Schedule  III of the Act. The statement of cash flows is prepared and  presented as per the requirements of Ind AS.  A summary of the material accounting policies and other  explanatory information is provided in accordance with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  notified under section 133 of the Act, including applicable  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and accounting  principles generally accepted in India. The standalone financial statements are presented in Indian  Rupees  (₹)  in  crore,  except  otherwise,  which  is  also  the  functional  currency  of  the  Company,  with  rounding  off  to  two decimals as permitted by Schedule III to the Act, unless  otherwise indicated. B.3   B asis of measurement The  standalone  financial  statements  are  prepared  on  the  historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and  liabilities, which are measured at fair value at the end of each  reporting period and defined benefit plans – plan assets that  are measured based on the Projected Unit Credit Method. B.4   U se of estimates The  preparation  of  standalone  financial  statements  in  conformity with Ind AS requires the Management of the  Company to make judgements, estimates and assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  balances  of  assets  and  liabilities  and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the  date of the standalone financial statements and the reported  amount of income and expenses for the reporting period.  The application of accounting policies that require critical  accounting  estimates  involving  complex  and  subjective  judgements and the use of assumptions in the standalone  financial statements have been disclosed as applicable in the  respective notes to accounts. Accounting estimates can change from period to period.  Future results could differ from these estimates. Appropriate  changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes  aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates.  Changes in estimates are reflected in the standalone financial  statements in the period in which changes are made and  if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the  standalone financial statements. B.5   F air value measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the measurement date, regardless of  whether that price is directly observable or estimated using  another valuation technique. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the  Company uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair  values are categorised under different levels (Level 1, Level 2  or Level 3) in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in  the valuation techniques as follows:  Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1  that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or  indirectly Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs) If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a  liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then  the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the  same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input  that is significant to the entire measurement. The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair  value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which  the change has occurred. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has  determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the  nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the  level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. At each  reporting date, the Management analyses the movements in  the values of assets and liabilities, which are required to be  remeasured or re-assessed as per the Company’s accounting  policies. C.   S ummary of material accounting  policies C.1   R evenue recognition a.   In terest income  Interest income is recognised in the standalone  statement of profit and loss using the effective interest  rate (EIR) method for all financial assets measured at  amortised cost or debt instruments measured at Fair  Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI).  EIR is the rate that discounts estimated future cash  receipts through the expected life of the financial asset  to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. The  calculation of EIR includes all fees received between  parties to the contract that are an integral part of the  contract, transaction costs and all other premiums or  discounts. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets. Interest income on credit-impaired assets is recognised  by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised  cost (net of impairment loss allowance) of the financial  asset. If the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired,  the Company reverts to calculating interest income on a  gross basis. Interest  on  financial  assets  measured  at  Fair  Value  through  Profit  or  Loss  (FVTPL)  is  recognised  at  the  contractual rate of interest. b.   D ividend income  Income from dividends on shares of corporate bodies  and units of mutual funds is accounted for when the  Company’s right to receive the dividend is established. c.   O ther revenue from operations The Company recognises revenue from contracts with  customers (other than financial assets to which Ind AS  109 ‘Financial instruments’ is applicable) based on a  comprehensive assessment model as set out in Ind AS  115 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. Revenue  is measured at the transaction price allocated to the  performance obligation in accordance with Ind AS 115.  The  Company  identifies  contract(s)  with  a  customer  and  its  performance  obligations  under  the  contract,  determines the transaction price and its allocation to the  performance obligations in the contract and recognises  revenue only on satisfactory completion of performance  obligations. In case of discounts, rebates, credits, price incentives or  similar terms, consideration is determined based on its  most likely amount, which is assessed at each reporting  period. l   F ees, commission and other services  Fees on value-added services and products  are recognised for the rendering of services and  products to the customer. l   N et gain on fair value changes:  The  Company  recognises  gains/(losses)  on  fair  value  change  of  financial  assets  measured  at  FVTPL and FVOCI and realised gains/(losses) on  derecognition  of  financial  assets  measured  at  FVTPL and FVOCI on net basis. C.2   Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to  a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or  equity instrument of another entity. a.   F inancial assets Financial assets are recognised in the Company’s  financial  statements  when  the  Company  becomes  a party to the contractual provisions of the financial  instruments. l    C  lassification Upon  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  are  classified into one of the following categories: l   A mortised Cost (AC),  l   F air Value through Other Comprehensive  Income (FVOCI), or l   F air Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)   T he  classification  is  determined  based  on  the  Company’s business model for managing the  financial  assets  and  the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics of the financial asset. The business  model for managing financial assets refers to the  way its financial assets are managed in order to  achieve its business objective. The business model  determines  whether  cash  flows  will  result  from  collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial  assets or both.  l   I nitial recognition and measurement All financial assets are initially recognised at fair  value except the following:   l   I nvestment in subsidiaries, associates and  joint venture which are recorded at cost;   l   F inancial assets measured at FVTPL are  recognised at fair value at the reporting date   T ransaction costs and revenues that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial  assets (other than financial assets measured at  FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair  value on initial recognition. Transaction costs and  revenues of financial assets measured at FVTPL  are recognised immediately in the standalone  statement  of  profit  and  loss.  However,  trade  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a  significant  financing component are measured at transaction  price.  l   S ubsequent measurement l   Financial assets at amortised cost   A  financial asset is measured at amortised  cost if it meets both of the following  conditions: l   t he asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets to collect  contractual cash flows and l   t he contractual terms of the financial asset  represent  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  Solely Payments of Principal and Interest  (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.   S ubsequent  to  initial  recognition,  financial  assets held within this category are measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest method,  less any impairment losses. 130 131 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED   l   ANNUAL REPORT FY 2024-25 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 l   F inancial assets at FVOCI A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it meets  both of the following conditions: l   t he asset is held within a business model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both  collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets; and l   t he contractual terms of the financial asset  represent  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely payments of principal and interest on  the principal amount outstanding.   F inancial assets designated as FVOCI are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value,  with  unrealised gains and losses recognised in other  comprehensive  income,  except  for  impairment  losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on  monetary assets. l   F inancial assets at FVTPL Financial assets not classified as either amortised  cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. Subsequent  changes in fair value are recognised in the  standalone statement of profit and loss. l   R eclassification of financial assets Financial  assets  are  reclassified  subsequent  to  their recognition only if the Company changes  its business model for managing those financial  assets. Changes in business model are made and  applied prospectively from the reclassification date,  which is the first day of immediately next reporting  period following the changes in business model in  accordance with principles laid down under Ind AS  109 ‘Financial Instruments’. l   D erecognition of financial assets Financial assets are derecognised when the  contractual rights to receive cash flows from the  asset have expired or have been transferred in  accordance with Ind AS 109, and the Company  has transferred substantially all risks and rewards  associated with the asset. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety,  the difference between (a) the carrying amount  (measured at the date of derecognition) and (b)  the consideration received (including any new  asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is  recognised in the standalone statement of profit  and loss. Financial assets are written off (either partially or  in full) when there is no reasonable expectation  of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a  portion thereof. However, financial assets that are  written off could still be subject to enforcement  activities under the Company recovery procedures,  considering legal advice where appropriate. Any  recoveries made are recognised in the standalone  statement of profit and loss on actual realisation  from customer. l   I nvestment in subsidiaries, associates and  joint ventures  The Company has accounted for its investments  in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at  cost less impairment loss (if any). Investments are  reviewed for impairment if events or changes in  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  may not be recoverable. l   I mpairment of financial assets The  Company  recognises  expected  credit  loss  allowances on: l   F inancial assets measured at amortised cost;  and l   F inancial assets measured at FVOCI – debt  instruments. Expected credit losses are measured based on  an assessment of the credit risk associated with  financial instruments. This assessment considers  historical experience, current economic conditions,  and forward-looking information relevant to the  collectability of contractual cash flows. l   General approach Both Lifetime ECLs and 12-month ECLs are  calculated on either an individual basis or a  collective basis, depending on the nature of the  underlying portfolio of financial instruments. Financial  assets  where  no  significant  increase  in credit risk has been observed are considered  to be in ‘stage 1’, for which a 12-month ECL is  recognised. Financial assets that are considered  to have a significant increase in credit risk are  considered to be in ‘stage 2’ and those which are  in default or for which there is objective evidence  of impairment are considered to be in ‘stage 3’.  Lifetime ECL is recognised for stage 2 and stage  3 financial assets. The Company has established a policy to perform  an assessment, at the end of each reporting period,  of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition,  by considering the change in the risk of default  occurring over the remaining life of the financial  instrument. Probability-Weighted Approach: Expected credit  losses are calculated using a probability-weighted  approach,  considering  a  range  of  possible  outcomes and their associated probabilities. This  approach incorporates both likelihood of default  and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company maintains allowances for expected  credit  losses,  which  are  deducted  from  the  carrying amount of the financial asset to present  the net carrying amount on the balance sheet.  The allowance is adjusted through the standalone  statement of profit and loss to reflect changes in  expected credit losses. l   Simplified approach The Company follows a ‘simplified approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade/ other receivables that do not contain a significant  financing  component.  The  application  of  a  simplified approach does not require the Company  to track changes in credit risk. The Company uses  historical default rates to determine impairment  loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every  reporting date, these historical default rates are  reviewed and changes in the forward-looking  estimates are analysed.  b.   F inancial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by  the Company are classified according to the substance  of the contractual arrangements entered into and the  definitions of financial liabilities and equity instruments. l   I nitial recognition and measurement All financial liabilities are recognised at fair value  and in case of borrowings and payables, net of  directly attributable costs. Fees of a recurring  nature are directly recognised in the standalone  statement of profit and loss as finance cost. l   S ubsequent measurement Financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost  using the effective interest method.  l   Derecognition A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is  derecognised from the Company’s balance sheet  when the obligation specified in the contract are  discharged, cancelled or have expired. Any gains  or losses arising on derecognition of liabilities are  recognised in the standalone Statement of Profit  and Loss. c.    C  ompound financial instruments The Company recognises separately the components  of a compound financial instrument that (a) creates a  financial liability of the entity and (b) grants an option to  the holder of the instrument to convert it into an equity  instrument of the entity. d.   O ffsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the  net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet only where  the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the  amount and Company intends, either to settle them on  a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability  simultaneously as permitted by Ind AS. C.3    C  ash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash on hand, cash  at  bank,  short-term  deposits  and  short-term  highly  liquid  investments with original maturities of three months or less  that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and  which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. C.4   T rade receivable A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of  consideration that is unconditional. C.5   Tax expenses The tax expenses for the period comprise current tax and  deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the standalone  statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates  to items recognised in the other comprehensive income. In  which case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive  income or equity. l   Cu rrent tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the  income tax authorities, based on tax rates and laws that  are enacted at the reporting date. l   D eferred tax Deferred  tax  is  recognised  on  temporary  differences  between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  in the financial statements and the corresponding tax  bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is  probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be  available  against  which the deductible temporary differences, and the  carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred  tax  items  in  correlation  to  the  underlying  transaction relating to Other comprehensive income or  Equity are recognised in Other comprehensive income  and Equity, respectively. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in  which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based  on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  The carrying amount of Deferred tax assets are reviewed  at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable  profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred  tax  asset  to  be  utilised.  Unrecognised  deferred  tax  assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are  recognised to the extent that it has become probable  that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax  assets to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a  legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets  against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to  the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. C.6   P roperty, plant and equipment Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  (PPE)  are  stated  at  cost,  net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses,  if  any.  Such  cost  includes  purchase  price,  borrowing  cost  and  any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its  working condition for its intended use, net charges on foreign  exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange  rate variations attributable to the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount  or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when  it is probable that future economic benefits associated with  the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured  reliably. Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a  cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of that item  are depreciated separately. Property, plant and equipment not ready for the intended use  on the date of the Balance Sheet are disclosed as ‘Capital  work-in-progress’. Advances given towards the acquisition of  property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance  sheet date are disclosed in other non-financial assets. Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are  specifically attributable to the acquisition of Property, Plant and  Equipment are allocated and capitalised as a part of the cost  of the respective Property, Plant and Equipment. Expenses on  repair and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit  and loss during the year in which such costs are incurred. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided  using straight line method on cost. Depreciation is provided  based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule  II to the Act. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation  of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial  year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant  and equipment are measured as the difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset  and are recognised in the standalone statement of profit and  loss when the asset is derecognised. C.7   Lea ses The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains)  a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the  inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease  if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a  specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right- to-use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly  specified in the arrangement. The Company, as a lessee,  recognises a Right-of-Use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for  its enforceable leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys  the right to control the use of an identified asset. The contract conveys the right to control the use of an  identified asset, if it involves the use of an identified asset and  the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits  from use of the asset and has the right to direct the use of the  identified asset. The Company measures the lease liability at the present value  of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement  date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using  the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be readily  determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the  Company uses an incremental borrowing rate. 132 133 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED   l   ANNUAL REPORT FY 2024-25 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 Costs, including depreciation, are recognised as an expense  in the standalone statement of profit and loss. Initial direct  costs are recognised immediately in the standalone statement  of profit and loss. For short-term and low-value leases, the company recognises  the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight- line basis over the lease term. None of the agreements and  contracts of the Company are resulting into ROU asset and  lease liability. C.8   O ther intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost of acquisition  net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less  accumulated amortisation/depletion and impairment losses,  if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing costs  and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its  working condition for the intended use, net charges on foreign  exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange  rate variations attributable to the other intangible assets. Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are  specifically attributable to the acquisition of other intangible  assets are allocated and capitalised as part of the cost of the  other intangible assets. Expenses on software support and  maintenance are charged to the standalone statement of profit  and loss during the year in which such costs are incurred. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an other  intangible asset are measured as the difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset  and are recognised in the standalone statement of profit and  loss when the asset is derecognised. Intangible Assets are amortised using the straight line method  on cost over the useful life of the assets. Other intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the  date of the Balance Sheet are disclosed as ‘Intangible assets  under development’. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for  other intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at  each reporting date. C.9   P rovision and contingent liabilities/ assets l   Provisions: Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of  a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of the obligation.  The amount recognised as a provision is the best  estimate of the consideration required to settle the  present obligation at the end of the reporting period,  considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the  obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the  expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects  current market assessments of the time value of money  and the risks specific to the liability.   l    C  ontingent liabilities/assets: A possible obligation that arises from past events  and  the  existence  of  which  will  be  confirmed  only  by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more  uncertain future events not wholly within the control  of the Company or; present obligation that arises from  past events where it is not probable that an outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be  required to settle the obligation; or the amount of the  obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability  are disclosed as contingent liability and not provided for.  Contingent  assets  are  disclosed  where  an  inflow  of  economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are  not recognised in the standalone financial statements. C.10   F inance costs Finance costs include interest expense computed by applying  the effective interest rate on respective financial instruments  measured at amortised cost. Financial instruments include  bank  term  loans,  non-convertible  debentures,  commercial  papers  and  exchange  differences  arising  from  foreign  currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an  adjustment to the interest cost. Finance costs are charged to  the standalone statement of profit and loss in the period for  which they are incurred. C.11   I mpairment of non-financial assets The Company assesses on each reporting date whether there  is any indication that any Property, Plant and Equipment and  Intangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash Generating  Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any such indication exists,  the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to  determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not  possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual  asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the  CGU to which the asset belongs. An impairment loss is recognised in the standalone statement  of profit and loss to the extent that, asset’s carrying amount  exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is  higher than an asset’s fair value less the cost of disposal and  value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future  cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of  the time value of money and risk specific to the assets. If the  recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is  estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying  amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its  recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in  the standalone statement of profit and loss. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying  amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased  to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount such that  the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss  had been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in  prior years. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognised  in the standalone statement of profit and loss. C.12   E mployee benefits expense a.   S hort-term employee benefits Liabilities for employee benefits, including non-monetary  benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within  12 months after the end of the period in which the  employees render the related service, are the amounts  expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.  Short-term  employee  benefits  are  recognised  in  the  standalone statement of profit and loss in the period in  which the related service is rendered. b.   L ong-term employee benefits The  expected  costs  of  other  long-term  employee  benefits,  such  as  long-term  service  incentive  plan  benefits (not being share-based payments), are accrued  over the requisite service period, which is typically the  vesting period. l   P ost-employment benefits l   Defined contribution plans A  defined  contribution  plan  is  a  post- employment  benefit  plan  under  which  an  entity pays fixed contributions into a separate  entity and will have no legal or constructive  obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations  for  contributions  to  defined  contribution  plans are recognised as an employee benefit  expense  in  the  standalone  statement  of  profit and loss in the periods during which  the related services are rendered by the  employees. The Company pays Provident and other fund  contributions to publicly administered funds  as per related Government regulations. The  Company has no further obligation other than  the contributions payable to the respective  funds. l   D efined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment  benefit plan other than a defined contribution  plan. The Company’s net obligation in  respect of defined benefit plans is calculated  separately for each plan annually by a  qualified actuary using the project unit credit  method and spread over the period during  which the benefit is expected to be derived  from employees’ services. Remeasurement gains or losses arising from  experience  adjustments  and  changes  in  actuarial assumptions are recognised directly  in other comprehensive income in the period  they occur and are subsequently transferred  to retained earnings. l   L eave encashment/compensated absences The Company’s net obligation in respect of  long-term  employee  benefits  other  than  post- employment  benefits  is  the  entitlement  to  compensated  absences.  The  expected  cost  of accumulated compensated absences is  determined by actuarial valuation using the  projected credit method for the unused entitlement  accumulated at the balance sheet date. The  benefits  are  discounted  using  the  market  yields at the end of the balance sheet date that  has terms approximating the terms of the related  obligation. Re- measurements resulting from  experience adjustments and changes in actuarial  assumptions are recognised in standalone  statement of profit and loss. C.13   E arnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit  after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the year adjusted for bonus element in  equity share. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures  used in the determination of basic earnings per share to  consider the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. C.14   F oreign currencies transactions  and translation Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the  exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  are translated at the functional currency’s closing rates of  exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising  on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised  in the standalone statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical  cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange  rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items  measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated  using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was  measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non- monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with  the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value  of the item. In the case of an asset, expense or income where a non- monetary advance is paid/received, the date of transaction is  the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If there  were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates  of transactions are determined for each payment or receipt of  advance consideration. C.15   O perating segments Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with  the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision  Maker (CODM) of the Company. The CODM is responsible for  allocating resources and assessing the performance of the  operating segments of the Company.  Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets and  segment liabilities have been identified to segments on the  basis of their relationship to the operating activities of the  segment. Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which are  related to the Company as a whole and are not allocable to  segments on a reasonable basis have been included under  unallocable revenue/expenses/assets or liabilities. C.16    C  ontract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or  services to a customer for which the Company has received  consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from  the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the  Company  transfers  goods  or  services  to  the  customer,  a  contract liability is recognised when the payment is made, or  the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities  are recognised as revenue when the Company performs  under the contract. D.    C  ritical  accounting  judgements  and key sources of estimations  uncertainty The  preparation  of  the  Company’s  financial  statements  requires the Management to make judgements, estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue,  expenses,  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  accompanying  disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could  result  in  outcomes  that  require  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amount  of  assets  or  liabilities  affected  in  the  subsequent  financial  year.  Accounting  estimates  and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions of estimates are recognised prospectively. D.1   P rovisions and contingent liabilities The timing of recognition and quantification of the provisions,  contingent  liabilities/assets  requires  the  application  of  judgement  to  existing  facts  and  circumstances  which  are  subject to change on the actual occurrence or happening.  Judgement is required for estimating the possible outflow of  resources, if any, in respect of contingencies/claims/litigations  against the Company and possible inflow of resources in  respect of the claims made by the Company which have been  considered to be contingent in nature. These are reviewed at  each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current  best estimates. 134 135 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED   l   ANNUAL REPORT FY 2024-25 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 D.2   I mpairment of financial assets The measurement of impairment losses across all categories  of financial assets requires judgement and the estimation of  the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining  impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase  in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several factors,  changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. It  has been the Company’s policy to regularly review its models  in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when  necessary. D.3   F air value measurement The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in  an active market and cannot be measured based on quoted  prices in active markets are determined using valuation  techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)  model. The Company uses its judgement to select a variety  of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on  market conditions at regular intervals. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets  where possible but where this is not feasible, a degree of  judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements  include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit  risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors  could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. 1     C  ash and Cash equivalents   ₹ i n crore Particulars As at   31 st  March, 2025 As at    31 st  March, 2024 Balance with banks      In current accounts 8.63 4.95 Total 8.63 4.95 2    B ank Balances other than Cash and Cash equivalents ₹ in crore Particulars As at   31 st  March, 2025 As at   31 st  March, 2024 Fixed deposits 517.00 4,443.00 (with original maturity period more than 3 months) Interest accrued on fixed deposit 32.52 142.25 Total 549.52 4,585.25 3    Loa ns   ₹ in crore Particulars As at   31 st  March, 2025 As at    31 st  March, 2024 (Unsecured, Considered good) A)   A t Amortised Cost Loan repayable on demand 1,755.00 92.00       ( Refer C below )   Total - Gross Loans 1,755.00 92.00 Less: Impairment loss allowance (7.02) (0.37) Total - Net Loans 1,747.98 91.63 B)   ( i) Loans in India: Public sector - - Others 1,755.00 92.00 Total - Gross Loans (A) 1,755.00 92.00 Less: Impairment loss allowance (B) (7.02) (0.37) Total - Net Loans (A) - (B) 1,747.98 91.63 (ii) Loans outside India - - Total - Net Loans 1,747.98 91.63   C) Type of Borrower ₹ in crore Particulars As at 31 st  March, 2025 As at 31 st  March, 2024 Amount  Outstanding  ₹ in crore Total Loans and  advances % Amount  Outstanding ₹ in crore Total Loans and  advances % Related parties Jio Leasing Services Limited  230.00  13.11% 92.00 100.00% Jio Finance Limited  1,500.00  85.47%   -      -    Jio Finance Platform and Service Limited  25.00  1.42%   -      -    Total - Gross Loans   1,755.00  100.00%  92.00  100.00% Note: All the above loans have been given for business purposes D.4   D efined benefit plans (gratuity  benefits) The company’s retirement benefit obligations, cost of the  defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the  gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions  that may differ from actual developments in the future. These  include the determination of the discount rate, inflation, future  salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the complexities  involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined  benefit  obligation  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  these  assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting  date. E.   Re cent accounting  pronouncements The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards  or amendment to the existing standards under Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to  time.

The Board of Directors has established the Group Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for overseeing development  and monitoring the Company’s risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities. Risk  management involves identifying, measuring, monitoring and managing risks on a regular basis. To achieve this objective, the Company  employs leading risk management practices and recruits experienced people. The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk  limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect  changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures,  aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company’s risk management policies and procedures and  reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The audit committee is assisted in  its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures,  the results of which are reported to the audit committee. The Board of Directors have constituted Group Risk Management Committee. The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in its  oversight of various risks (i) Credit Risk (ii) Market Risk (iii) Interest Rate Risk (iv) Liquidity Risk (v) Operational Risk. Different type of risk the Company is exposed are as under: (i) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the company if a customer or counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual  obligations and arises principally from the company’s receivable from customers, loans and investments in debt securities. a)    C  ash & cash equivalents and other bank balances The Company holds cash & cash equivalents and other bank balances aggregating ₹ 558.15 crore (previous year ₹ 4,590.20 crore).  The creditworthiness of such banks and financial institutions is evaluated by the management on an ongoing basis and is considered  to be good. b)   Investments The Company had limited its exposure to credit risk by investing in money market instruments that have an investment grade credit  rating. The Company monitors changes in credit risk by tracking external credit ratings. c)   Loans The Company has limited its exposure to credit risk by rendering loans only to its group companies, wherein the company has either  control or significant influence. (ii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the  Company’s income or the value of its holding of financial instruments. Main activity is to do investment in financial instruments. This market is influenced by domestic/international political, financial and other  events occurring on day-to-day basis. Hence the market is constantly volatile and uncertain. Company has strong treasury philosophies  and practices and is well geared to meet the challenges of volatile market conditions. (iii) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk consists primarily of risk inherent in ALM activities and relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market  interest rates on future net interest income (NII). Since the company does not have any financial assets or liabilities bearing floating  interest rates any change in interest rates at the reporting date would not have significant impact on standalone financial statement of  the company. Company’s borrowing for the current year and previous year is Nil from Bank/FI etc. (iv) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company may not be able to meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Company maintains  sufficient liquid assets to meet working capital requirements in the form of term deposits with banks and/or in money market instruments  which can be liquidated on demand. The Company’s financial liabilities consists mainly of accrued expenses and other liabilities which  are due within the next twelve months from the reporting date. The Company has sufficient funds to meet all maturing obligations.

Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of Jio Financial Services Limited (Formerly known as Reliance Strategic Investments Limited) Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements of Jio Financial Services Limited (formerly known as  Reliance Strategic Investments Limited) (hereinafter referred to as  “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries, (the Holding Company  and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which  includes the Group’s share of profit/(loss) in its associates and  joint ventures, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as  at March 31, 2025 and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated  Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of  Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date and notes to the  financial statements, including a summary of material accounting  policies and other explanatory information for the year ended on  that  date  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  consolidated  financial  statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to  the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial  statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013  (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view  in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards notified under  section 133 of the Act, read with Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time (“Ind AS”)  and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the  consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025 and  their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive  loss, their consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes  in equity for the year ended on that date.  Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements  in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (hereinafter referred  to as “the SAs”) specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our  responsibilities under those Standards are further described  in the “Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements” section of our report. We are independent of  the Group, its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the  Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (hereinafter referred to as “the ICAI”) together with the ethical  requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated  financial  statements  under  the  provisions  of  the  Act  and  the  Rules  made  thereunder  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the  ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained  by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  Key Audit Matters Key  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our  professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated  financial statements of the current period. These matters were  addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial  statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we  do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Considering  the requirements of SA 600 on ‘Using the Work of Another Auditor’,  below Key Audit Matter have been reproduced from the Independent  Auditors’ report on the audit of the financial statements of the  subsidiary. We have determined the matters described below to be  the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Key audit matter Auditors’ response Impairment of Financial Instruments (Expected Credit Losses): Ind AS 109 – ‘Financial Instruments’ requires the Company to provide for impairment  of its financial assets as at the reporting date using the expected credit loss (ECL)  approach. ECL involves an estimation of probability weighted loss on financial  instruments over their life, considering reasonable and supportable information about  past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions which  could impact the credit quality of the Company’s financial assets (loan portfolio). Impairment loss measurement requires use of statistical models to estimate the  Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default  (EAD). These models are key driver to measure Impairment loss. The key indicators underlying for assessment of impairment allowance are  periodically appraised by the management. The  most  significant  areas  where  we  identified  greater  levels  of  management  judgement are: (a)   Q ualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the loan assets carried at  amortised cost; (b)   B asis used for estimating probabilities of default (‘PD’), loss given default (‘LGD’)  and exposure at default (‘EAD’) at product level with past trends; (c)   J udgements used in projecting economic scenarios and probability weights  applied to reflect future economic conditions; and (d)   A ssigning rating grades to customers for which external rating is not available; The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined  that the value of ECL has a high degree of estimation & uncertainty. In view of the  significance of the amount of gross loan assets (₹ 10,093.78 crore) out of total  assets (₹ 11,105.33 crore) in the Financial Statements (90.89% of the total assets),  impairment of loan assets has been considered as key audit matter in our audit. [Refer Note No. 3 to the Financial Statements read with Accounting Policy No. C.2 (a)  (VI) of the subsidiary (Jio Finance Limited)] The  component’s  auditors  (being  other  firm  of  chartered accountants) have performed the  following audit procedures: a.   R ead and assessed the Company’s ECL  policy and Accounting policy for impairment of  financial assets and its compliance with Ind AS  109 and the governance framework approved  by the Board of Directors pursuant to RBI  (NBFC – Scale Based Regulation) Directions,  2023. b.   T ested the design and operating effectiveness  of the controls for staging of loans based  on their past-due status. Tested samples of  performing (stage 1) loans to assess whether  any loss indicators were present requiring them  to be classified under stage 2 or 3. c.   T hey have performed procedures to test the  inputs  used  in  the  ECL  computation,  on  a  sample basis. d.   T ested assumptions used by the management  for considering macro-economic factors. e.   T ested the arithmetical accuracy of computation  of ECL provision performed by the Company in  spreadsheets. f.   E xamined disclosures included in the Financial  Statements  in  respect  of  expected  credit  losses. Key audit matter Auditors’ response Information Technology (IT) Systems and Controls of one subsidiary (Jio Finance  Limited):  The reliability and security of IT systems play a key role in the business operations,  financial accounting and reporting process of the Company. Since large volume  of transactions are processed daily, the IT controls are required to ensure that  applications process data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate  manner. Any gaps in the IT control environment could result in a material misstatement  of the financial accounting and reporting records. Therefore, due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the IT environment, the  assessment of the general IT controls and the application controls specific to the  accounting and preparation of financial information is considered to be a key audit  matter. The  component’s  auditors  (being  other  firm  of  chartered accountants) have performed the  following audit procedures for testing IT general  controls and for assessing the reliability of  electronic  data  processing,  assisted  by  their  IT  specialists: a.   T he aspects covered in the IT General Control  audit were (i) Policy Management including  User Access Review and Change Management  System (ii) IT Governance Framework (iii) IT  Outsourcing Adherence to understand the risk  methodology as well as design and test the  operating effectiveness of such controls; b.   A ssessed the changes that were made to the  key systems during the audit period that have  impact on financial reporting on a sample basis; c.   T ested the periodic review of policies and  governance framework. We reviewed policies  within the organisation as well as structure  including oversight by management. Further  we inspected backup, logs, PIM, user access  rules, Business Continuity Management. d.   P erformed tests of controls (including other  compensatory controls wherever applicable)  on the IT application controls and IT dependent  manual controls in the system. e.   T ested the design and operating effectiveness  of compensating controls, where deficiencies  were identified and, where necessary, extended  the scope of our substantive audit procedures.

The other information comprises the information  included in the Board’s report, Corporate Governance Report  and Business and Sustainability Report but does not include  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  standalone  financial  statements and our auditors’ report thereon. •   O ur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not  cover the other information and we do not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon. •   I n  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information,  compare with the financial statements of the subsidiaries, joint  ventures and associates audited by the other auditors, to the  extent it relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance  on the work of the other auditors and consider whether the  other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated  financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course  of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.   •   I f, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that  there is a material misstatement of this other information, we  are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this  regard. Responsibilities of Management and Board  of Directors for the Consolidated Financial  Statements The Holding company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the  matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the  preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a  true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated  financial  performance  including  other  comprehensive  income,  consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in equity of the  Group including its Associates and joint ventures in accordance with  the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind  AS. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in  the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible  for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with  the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group  and its associates and its joint ventures and for preventing and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates  that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls,  that  were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of  the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation  of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which  have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated  financial statements by the Directors of the Holding company, as  aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective  Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in  the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible  for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless the respective Board of Directors either intend to liquidate  their respective entities or to cease operations or has no realistic  alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the  Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also responsible  for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its  associates and joint ventures.    Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue  an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or  error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial  statements.  As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  skepticism  throughout  the  audit. We also: •   I dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,  design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks  and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control. •   O btain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we  are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the  Holding company has adequate internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the  operating effectiveness of such controls. •   E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by the management. •    C  onclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the  going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to  events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability  of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue  as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty  exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to  the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements  or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions  may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to  cease to continue as a going concern. •   E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures and  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair  presentation. •   O btain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial information of the entities or business activities within  the  Group  and  its  associates  and  joint  ventures  to  express  an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are  responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of  the audit of the financial statements of such entities or business  activities included in the consolidated financial statements of  which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities  or  business  activities  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, such  other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision  and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain  solely responsible for our audit opinion.  Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated  financial  statements  that,  individually  or  in  aggregate,  makes  it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably  knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may  be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative  factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating  the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified  misstatements in the consolidated financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding  company and such other entities included in the consolidated  financial statements of which we are the independent auditors  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of  the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant  deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our  audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement  that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding  independence and to communicate with them all relationships  and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most  significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in  extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not  be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences  of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication.

Management and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for  Internal Financial Controls The respective Company’s management and Board of Directors  of the companies included in the Group, its associate companies  and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India,  are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based  on criteria for the internal control with reference to consolidated  financial  statements  established  by  the  respective  Companies  considering the essential components of internal control stated  in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial  Reporting  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  Guidance  Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  (hereinafter referred to as “the ICAI”). These responsibilities include  the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the  orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records and the timely preparation  of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies  Act, 2013. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the  Group, its associate companies and its joint ventures, which are  companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted  our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI  and the Standards on Auditing, specified under Section 143(10) of  the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that  we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements was established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness.  Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on  the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the  audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiary  companies, associate companies and joint ventures, which are  companies incorporated in India, in terms of their reports referred to  in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the  Group, its associate companies and its joint ventures, which are  companies incorporated in India. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements  A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated  financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A  company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated  financial statements includes those policies and procedures that  (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of  the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the  company are being made only in accordance with authorisations  of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s  assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements  Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the possibility of collusion or improper management override of  controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur  and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements  may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.

C  orporate information Jio Financial Services Limited (formerly known as Reliance  Strategic Investments Limited) (“the Parent Company”), with  Corporate  ID  No.  (CIN  L65990MH1999PLC120918),  is  a  registered Non-Banking Financial Company - Systemically  Important Non-Deposit taking Company as defined under  section 45-IA of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 with  effect from December 31, 1999, having registration number  13.01327.  The  registered  office  of  the  parent  company  is  located at 1 st  Floor, Building 4NA, Maker Maxity, Bandra Kurla  Complex, Bandra (East), Mumbai, Maharashtra 400051, India.  The parent company is considered as Middle layer (NBFC-ML)  pursuant to RBI Scale Based regulations. In accordance with RBI approval of the change in control  and  shareholding  as  per  Scheme  of  Arrangement,  the  parent company had met the required eligibility criteria for  classification as a Core Investment company (CIC). Pursuant  certificate  of  registration  and  approval  received  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  on  July  9,  2024,  the  parent  company  has  been  classified  as  a  Non-Deposit  Taking  Systemically Important Core Investment Company (CIC-NO- SI) with effect from that date. The equity shares of the Parent Company were listed on  the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock  Exchange (NSE), India effective August 21, 2023. The  Consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  financial  statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries  (collectively  referred  to  as  “the  Group”),  along  with  its  associates and joint venture. The Group, along with its associates and joint venture, is  engaged in the business of investing and financing, insurance  broking, payment bank, payment aggregator and payment  gateway services. B.   B asis of preparation   B.1   S tatement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in  accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as per  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,  as amended from time to time and notified under section 133  of the Companies Act, 2013 (referred to as “the Act”), along  with other relevant provisions of the Act, the Master Direction  – Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Company –  Scale Based Regulation) Directions, 2023 (as amended from  time to time) and other guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of  India (RBI) as applicable and amended from time-to-time and  other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The  Group uses the accrual basis of accounting in the preparation  of financial statements (other than Statement of Cash Flows).  The financial statements have been prepared and presented  on the going concern basis. The  accounting  policies  have  been  consistently  applied,  except  in  cases  where  a  newly  issued  Ind  AS  is  initially  adopted or when a revision to an existing Ind AS required a  change in the accounting policy previously in use. These Consolidated financial statements have been approved  by the Parent Company’s Board of Directors and authorised  for issue on April 18, 2025. B.2   P resentation of consolidated  financial statements The  consolidated  balance  sheet,  consolidated  statement  of profit and loss and consolidated statement of changes  in equity adhere to the format prescribed in Division III of  Schedule III of the Act. The consolidated statement of cash  flows is prepared and presented as per the requirements of  Ind AS. A summary of material accounting policies and other  explanatory information is provided in accordance with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  notified under section 133 of the Act, including applicable  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and accounting  principles generally accepted in India.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Indian Rupees (₹) in crore (except otherwise indicated), which  is also the functional currency of the Group, with rounding  off to two decimals as permitted by Schedule III to the Act,  unless otherwise indicated. B.3   B asis of measurement The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the  historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and  liabilities, which are measured at fair value at the end of each  reporting period and defined benefit plans – plan assets that  are measured based on the Projected Unit Credit Method. B.4   B asis of consolidation Consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  using  uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other  events in similar circumstances. If an entity in the Group  uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the  consolidated financial statements for like transactions and  events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are  made to that entity’s financial statements for the purpose of  the consolidated financial statements to ensure uniformity  with the Group’s accounting policies. In  accordance  with  Ind  AS  110,  Consolidated  Financial  Statements, the financial statements of the company and its  subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding  together  like  items  of  assets,  liabilities,  equity,  income,  expenses and cash flows after fully eliminating intra-group  balances and intra-group transactions. The Parent Company  exercises control over a subsidiary or entity if it is exposed  to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and  has the ability to affect those returns through its power over  the entity. The carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each  subsidiary is offset/eliminated with the parent’s portion of  equity of each subsidiary. Any excess/deficit arising out of the  said elimination is accounted for as Goodwill on consolidation/ capital  reserve.  Additionally,  all  intragroup  assets  and  liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to  transactions between entities of the group are eliminated. In accordance with Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates  and Joint Ventures, the Parent Company accounts for its  investments in entities with joint control or significant influence  (associates) using the Equity method of accounting. Under  this method, the Group initially recognises its investment at  cost, which is adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition  change in the Parent Company’s share of the investee’s net  assets.  The  Group’s  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss includes its share of the investee’s profit or loss and the  Group’s other comprehensive income includes its share of  the investee’s other comprehensive income. The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  results  of  the parent company, its subsidiaries, associates and joint  venture.  B.5   U se of estimates The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity with Ind AS requires management of the Parent  Company to make judgements, estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and  disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date  of the consolidated financial statements and the reported  amount of income and expenses for the reporting period.  The application of accounting policies that require critical  accounting  estimates  involving  complex  and  subjective  judgments and the use of assumptions in the consolidated  financial statements have been disclosed as applicable in the  respective notes to accounts.  (d)   Taxes are treated as arising from operating activities and not bifurcated between investing and financing activities (e)   Figures in brackets represent outflow of the funds.

NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 Accounting estimates can change from period to period.  Future results could differ from these estimates. Appropriate  changes in estimates are made as the Management of  the respective companies becomes aware of changes  in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes  in  estimates  are  reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements in the period in which changes are made and,  if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements. B.6   F air value measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the measurement date, regardless of  whether that price is directly observable or estimated using  another valuation technique. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the  Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair  values are categorised under different levels (Level 1, Level 2  or Level 3) in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used  in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities  Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1  that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or  indirectly Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs) If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a  liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then  the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the  same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input  that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair  value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during  which the change has occurred. For  the  purpose  of  fair  value  disclosures,  the  Group  has  determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of  the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability  and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.  At  each  reporting  date,  the  Management  analyses  the  movements in the values of assets and liabilities, which are  required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Group’s  accounting policies. C.   S ummary of material accounting  policies C.1   B usiness combination The Group accounts for its business combinations under  acquisition method of accounting, except for common control  transactions, which are accounted for using the pooling of  interest method involving the following: a.   T he assets and liabilities of the combining entities are  reflected at their carrying amounts. b.   N o  adjustments  are  made  to  reflect  fair  values  or  recognise any new assets or liabilities. The only adjustments  that are made are to harmonize accounting policies. c.   T he  financial  information  in  the  financial  statements  in respect of prior periods should be restated as if the  business combination had occurred from the beginning of  the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective  of the actual date of the combination. However, if business  combination had occurred after that date, the prior period  information shall be restated only from that date. The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of the  assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities  assumed at the acquisition date, i.e. the date on which control  is acquired. Contingent consideration to be transferred is  recognised at fair value and included as part of the cost of  acquisition. Transaction-related costs are expensed in the  period in which the costs are incurred. For each business combination, the Group elects whether  to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree  at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s  identifiable net assets. Goodwill/Capital reserve arising on business combination is  initially measured at cost, being the difference between the  aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount  recognised for non-controlling interest and any previous  interest held, over the fair value of net identifiable assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  After  initial  recognition,  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and measured at  cost less any accumulated impairment losses, if any. C.2   Revenue recognition l   In terest income Interest income is recognised in the consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss  using  the  effective  interest  rate  (EIR)  method for all financial assets measured at amortised cost  or debt instruments measured at Fair Value through Other  Comprehensive Income (FVOCI).  EIR is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts  through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross  carrying amount of a financial asset. The calculation of EIR  includes all fees received between parties to the contract that  are an integral part of the contract, transaction costs, and all  other premiums or discounts. Subvention  income  received  from  manufacturer/dealers  at  the  inception  of  the  loan  contracts,  which  is  directly  attributable to individual loan contracts in respect of goods  financed is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss using the effective interest rate method over the  tenor of such loan contracts measured at amortised cost. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition of financial assets. Interest income on credit-impaired assets is recognised by  applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (net  of impairment loss allowance) of the financial asset. If the  financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, the Group reverts  to calculate interest income on a gross basis. Interest on financial assets measured at Fair Value through  Profit or Loss (FVTPL) is recognised at the contractual rate  of interest. l   D ividend income Income from dividend on shares of corporate bodies and  units of mutual funds is accounted for when the Group’s right  to receive the dividend is established. l   O ther revenue from operations Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised  when control of the goods or services are transferred to  the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration  entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group  recognises revenue from contracts with customers (other than  financial assets to which Ind AS 109 ‘Financial instruments’ is  applicable) based on a comprehensive assessment model as  set out in Ind AS 115 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers.  The  Group  identifies  contract(s)  with  a  customer  and  its  performance  obligations  under  the  contract,  determines  the transaction price and its allocation to the performance  obligations in the contract and recognises revenue only  on satisfactory completion of performance obligations.  Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration which  the group expects to be entitled to in change for transferring  distinct goods or services to a customer as specified in the  contract,  excluding  amounts  collected  on  behalf  of  third  parties (for example, taxes and duties collected on behalf  of the government). Consideration is generally due upon  satisfaction of performance obligation and a receivable is  recognised when it becomes unconditional.  In case of discounts, rebates, credits, price incentives or  similar  terms,  consideration  are  determined  based  on  its  most  likely  amount,  which  is  assessed  at  each  reporting  period. l   F ees, commission and other services  The Group recognises service and administration  charges towards rendering of additional services to its  loan customers on satisfactory completion of service  delivery. Bounce charges levied on customers for  non-payment of instalments on the contractual date is  recognised on acceptance thereof by the customers. Fees on value-added services and products are  recognised for the rendering of services and products  to the customer. Foreclosure charges are collected from loan customers  for early payment/closure of loan and are recognised on  acceptance thereof by the customers. Commission income earned for the services rendered  are recognised as and when they are due. The Group earns service fees from merchants and  recognises such revenue when the control in services  have been transferred by the Group, i.e., as and when  services have been provided by the Group. Such a  service fee is generally determined as a percentage of  transaction value executed by the merchants.  l   N et gain on fair value changes The  Group  recognises  gains/(losses)  on  fair  value  change  of  financial  assets  measured  at  FVTPL  and  FVOCI and realised gains/(losses) on derecognition of  financial asset measured at FVTPL and FVOCI on net  taxes. C.3   F inancial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a  financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity  instrument of another entity. a.   F inancial assets Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s financial  statements when the Group becomes party to the  contractual provisions of the financial instruments. l    C  lassification Upon  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  are  classified into one of the following categories: l   A mortised Cost (AC),  l   F air Value through Other Comprehensive  Income (FVOCI), or l   F air Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) The  classification  is  determined  based  on  the  Group’s business model for managing the  financial  assets  and  the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics of the instrument. The business  model  for  managing  financial  assets  refers  to  the way its financial assets are managed in order  to achieve the Group’s business objective. The  business model determines whether cash flows  will result from collecting contractual cash flows,  selling financial assets or both. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows  are solely payments of principal and interest, the  Group considers the contractual terms of the  instrument. This includes assessing whether the  financial asset contains a contractual term that  could change the timing or amount of contractual  cash  flows  such  that  it  would  not  meet  this  condition. l   I nitial recognition and measurement All financial assets are initially recognised at fair  value,  except  Investment  in  Joint  Venture  and  associates which are recorded at cost.  Transaction costs and revenues that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial  assets (other than financial assets measured at  FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair  value on initial recognition. Transaction costs and  revenues of financial assets measured at FVTPL  are recognised immediately in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss.  However,  trade  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a  significant  financing component are measured at transaction  price. Purchases or sales of financial assets that  require delivery of assets within a time frame  established by regulation or convention in the  marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised  on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group  commits to purchase or sell the asset. l   S ubsequent measurement l   F inancial assets at amortised cost   A  financial asset is measured at amortised  cost if it meets both of the following  conditions: l   t he asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets to collect  contractual cash flows; and l   t he contractual terms of the financial asset  represent  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  Solely Payments of Principal and Interest  (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.   S ubsequent  to  initial  recognition,  financial  assets held within this category are measured  at amortised cost using the effective interest  method, less any impairment losses. l   F inancial assets at FVOCI A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it meets  both of the following conditions: l   t he asset is held within a business model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both  collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets; and l   t he contractual terms of the financial asset  represent  contractual  cash  flows  that  are  solely payments of principal and interest on  the principal amount outstanding.   F inancial assets designated as FVOCI are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value,  with  unrealised gains and losses recognised in  other  comprehensive  income,  except  for  impairment  losses  and  foreign  exchange  gains and losses on monetary assets. l   F inancial assets at FVTPL Financial  assets  not  classified  as  either  amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL.  Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised  in consolidated statement of profit and loss. l   R eclassification of financial assets Financial  assets  are  reclassified  subsequent  to  their recognition only if the Group changes its  business  model  for  managing  those  financial  assets. Changes in business model are made and  applied  prospectively  from  the  reclassification  date, which is the first day of immediately next  reporting period following the changes in business  186 187 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 model in accordance with principles laid down  under Ind AS 109 “Financial Instruments”. l   D erecognition of financial assets Financial assets are derecognised when the  contractual rights to receive cash flows from the  asset have expired or have been transferred in  accordance with Ind AS 109 and the Group has  transferred substantially all risks and rewards  associated with the asset. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety,  the difference between (a) the carrying amount  (measured at the date of derecognition) and (b)  the consideration received (including any new  asset obtained less any new liability assumed)  is recognised in consolidated statement of profit  and loss. Financial assets are written off (either partially or  in full) when there is no reasonable expectation  of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a  portion thereof. However, financial assets that are  written off could still be subject to enforcement  activities under the Group’s recovery procedures,  considering legal advice where appropriate.  Any recoveries made are recognised in the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss  on  actual realisation from customer. l   I mpairment of financial assets The  Group  recognises  Expected  Credit  Losses  (ECL)  on  financial  instruments  measured  at  amortised  cost  or  FVOCI,  including  loans,  receivables and debt securities, as per Ind AS 109. Expected credit losses are measured based on  an assessment of the credit risk associated with  financial instruments. This assessment considers  historical experience, current economic conditions  and forward-looking information relevant to the  collectability of contractual cash flows. The financial assets are classified into one of the  three stages (Stage 1, Stage 2 or Stage 3) based  on  the  assessed  credit  risk  of  the  instrument/ facility.  Financial  assets  where  no  significant  increase in credit risk has been observed are  considered to be in ‘stage 1’ for which a 12-month  ECL is recognised. Financial assets that are  considered to have a significant increase in credit  risk are considered to be in ‘stage 2’ and those  which are in default or for which there is objective  evidence of impairment are considered to be in  ‘stage 3’. Lifetime ECL is recognised for stage 2  and stage 3 financial assets. l    G  eneral approach Both Lifetime ECLs and 12-month ECLs are  calculated on either an individual basis or a  collective basis, depending on the nature of the  underlying portfolio of financial instruments. The  expected credit loss is a product of exposure at  default  (‘EAD’),  probability  of  default  (‘PD’)  and  loss given default (‘LGD’). The Group has devised  an internal model to evaluate the PD and LGD  based on the parameters set out in Ind AS 109.  LGD is an estimate of loss from a transaction  given that a default occurs. PD is defined as the  probability of whether the borrowers will default  on their obligations in the future. Ind AS 109  requires the use of separate PD for a 12-month  duration and a lifetime duration depending on the  stage allocation of the borrower. EAD represents  the expected exposure in the event of a default  and is the gross carrying amount in case of the  financial assets held by the Group. The Group has established a policy to perform  an  assessment,  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit  risk  has  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition, by considering the change in the risk  of default occurring over the remaining life of the  financial instrument. Expected credit losses are  calculated using a probability-weighted approach,  considering a range of possible outcomes and  their associated probabilities. This approach  incorporates both the likelihood of default and the  severity of loss in the event of default. The  Group  maintains  allowances  for  expected  credit  losses,  which  are  deducted  from  the  carrying amount of the financial asset to present  the net carrying amount on the balance sheet. The  allowance is adjusted through the consolidated  statement of profit and loss to reflect changes in  expected credit losses. l   Si mplified approach  The  Group  follows  a  ‘simplified  approach’  for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on  trade/other  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a  significant financing component. The application  of simplified approach does not require the Group  to track changes in credit risk. The Group uses  historical default rates to determine impairment  loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every  reporting date, these historical default rates are  reviewed and changes in the forward-looking  estimates are analysed. l   E CL on debt instruments measured at FVOCI The ECL for debt instruments measured at  FVOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of  these financial assets in the balance sheet, which  remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal  to the allowance that would arise if the assets  were measured at amortised cost is recognised  in  OCI  as  an  accumulated  impairment  amount,  with a corresponding charge to the consolidated  statement of profit and loss. The accumulated loss  recognised in OCI is recycled to the consolidated  statement of profit and loss upon derecognition  of the assets. l   F orward-looking information While estimating the expected credit losses, the  Group reviews macro-economic developments  occurring in the economy and the market it  operates in. The Group considers a broad range of forward- looking  information  with  reference  to  external  forecasts of various macro-economic factors  for  example  GDP  growth,  unemployment  rates,  inflation  etc,  as  considered  relevant  so  as  to  determine the impact of macro-economic factors  on the Group’s ECL estimates.  b.   F inancial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by  the Group are classified according to substance of the  contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions  of a financial liabilities and an equity instrument. l   I nitial recognition and measurement All financial liabilities are recognised at fair value  and  in  case  of  borrowings  and  payables,  net  of directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring  nature are directly recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss as finance cost. l   S ubsequent measurement Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised cost  using the effective interest method. l   Derecognition A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability)  is derecognised from the group’s balance sheet  when the obligations specified in the contract are  discharged, cancelled or have expired. Any gains  or losses arising on derecognition of liabilities are  recognised in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss. c.    C  ompound financial instruments The Group recognises separately the components  of  compound  financial  instrument  that  (a)  creates  a  financial liability of the entity and (b) grants an option to  the holder of the instrument to convert it into an equity  instrument of the entity. d.   O ffsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and  the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet only  where the Group has a legally enforceable right to set  off the amount and the Group intends, either to settle  them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the  liability simultaneously as permitted by Ind AS. C.4    C  ash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash on hand, cash  at  bank,  short-term  deposits  and  short-term  highly  liquid  investments with original maturities of three months or less  that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and  which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. C.5   Trade receivable A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of  consideration that is unconditional. C.6   Tax expenses The tax expenses for the period comprises of current tax and  deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss,  except  to  the  extent  that  it  relates to items recognised in the other comprehensive  income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in other  comprehensive income or equity. l   Cu rrent tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the  income tax authorities, based on tax rates and laws that  are enacted at the reporting date. l   D eferred tax Deferred  tax  is  recognised  on  temporary  differences  between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  in the financial statements and the corresponding tax  bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is  probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be  available  against  which  the  deductible  temporary  differences  and  the  carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred  tax  items  in  correlation  to  the  underlying  transaction relating to other comprehensive income  and Equity are recognised in other comprehensive  income and Equity, respectively. Deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  are  measured  at  the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period  in which the liability is settled or the asset realised,  based  on  tax  rates  (and  tax  laws)  that  have  been  enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the  reporting period. The carrying amount of Deferred  tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting  period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to  allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.  Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at  each reporting date and are recognised to the extent  that it has become probable that future taxable profits  will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a  legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets  against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to  the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. C.7   P roperty, Plant and Equipment Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  (PPE)  are  stated  at  cost,  net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses,  if  any.  Such  cost  includes  purchase  price,  borrowing  cost  and  any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its  working condition for its intended use, net charges on foreign  exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange  rate variations attributable to the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount  or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when  it is probable that future economic benefits associated with  the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured  reliably. Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a  cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of that item  are depreciated separately. Property, plant and equipment not ready for the intended use  on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as ‘Capital work- in-progress’. Advances given towards acquisition of property,  plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date  are disclosed in other non-financial assets. Administrative  and  other  general  overhead  expenses  that  are  specifically  attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  property,  plant and equipment are allocated and capitalised as a part  of the cost of the respective property, plant and equipment.  Expenses  on  repair  and  maintenance  are  charged  to  the  consolidated statement of profit and loss during the year in  which such costs are incurred. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided  using straight line method on cost. Depreciation is provided  based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule  II to the Act. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  reviewed  at  each  financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.  PPE is derecognised on disposal (i.e. at the date the recipient  obtains control) or when no future economic benefits are  expected  from  its  use.  Any  gains  or  losses  arising  from  derecognition of property, plant and equipment are measured  as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and  the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss when the asset is  derecognised. Management reviews the estimated useful lives and residual  values of the assets annually in order to determine the  amount of depreciation to be recorded during any reporting  period. The useful lives and residual values are based on  the  Company’s  historical  experience  with  similar  assets  and take into account anticipated technological changes.  The depreciation for future periods is adjusted if there are  significant changes from previous estimates. C.8   Leases The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease  as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease  requires significant judgement. The Group uses significant  judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated  renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains)  a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the  inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease  if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a  188 189 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 specific asset or assets, and the arrangement conveys a right- to-use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly  specified in an arrangement. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable  period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an  option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain  not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group  is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease  or not to exercise the option to terminate a lease, it considers  all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic  incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the  lease or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The  Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non- cancellable period of a lease. l   A s lessee The Group, as a lessee, recognises a Right-of-Use  (ROU) asset and a lease liability for its enforceable  leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the  right to control the use of an identified asset. The contract conveys the right to control the use  of an identified asset, if it involves the use of an  identified asset and the Group has substantially  all of the economic benefits from use of the asset  and has the right to direct the use of the identified  asset. The Group measures the lease liability at the  present value of the lease payments that are not  paid at the commencement date of the lease.  The lease payments are discounted using the  interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be  readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily  determined,  the  Group  uses  an  incremental  borrowing rate. Costs including depreciation are recognised as an  expense in the consolidated statement of profit and  loss. Initial direct costs are recognised immediately  in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. For short-term and low-value leases, the Group  recognises the lease payments as an operating  expense on a straight-line basis over the lease  term. None of the agreements and contracts of  the Group are resulting into ROU asset and lease  liability. l   As  lessor The Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as  an operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are  classified as finance leases whenever the terms  of the lease transfer substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other  leases are classified as operating leases. The Group gives service equipment on lease  where it has substantially retained the risks and  rewards of ownership and hence are classified as  operating lease and included in PPE. Costs,  including  depreciation,  are  recognised  as an expense in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss. Initial direct costs are recognised  immediately in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss. Asset given on finance lease Assets  given  under  finance  lease  are  recognised  as  a  receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the  lease as defined under IND AS 116. All initial direct cost  incurred to put the leased asset for intended use are included  in the initial measurement of net investment. Lease rentals are apportioned between the principal and  interest components. The principal portion received reduces  the net investment in the lease, while the finance income is  recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss  based on the net investment in the lease, using the interest  rate implicit in the lease contract. C.9   O ther intangible assets Intangible Assets are recognised when it is probable that  the  future  economic  benefits  that  are  attributable  to  the  asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can  be measured reliably. Other intangible assets are stated at  cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade discount  and  rebates  less  accumulated  amortisation/depletion  and  impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes purchase price,  borrowing costs and any cost directly attributable to bringing  the asset to its working condition for the intended use, net  charges  on  foreign  exchange  contracts  and  adjustments  arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the other  intangible assets. Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are  specifically attributable to the acquisition of other intangible  assets are allocated and capitalised as part of the cost of  the intangible assets. Expenses on software support and  maintenance are charged to the consolidated statement  of profit and loss during the year in which such costs are  incurred. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount  or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when  it is probable that future economic benefits associated with  the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured  reliably.  Other Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income  earned  during  the  project  development  stage  prior  to  its  intended use, are considered as pre-operative expenses and  disclosed under Intangible Assets Under Development. An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no  future economic benefits are expected from its use. Gains or  losses arising from derecognition of another intangible asset  are measured as the difference between the net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are  recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss  when the asset is derecognised. Group’s other intangible assets are amortised using straight  line method on cost over the useful life of the assets. Other intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the  date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as ‘Intangible assets  under development’. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for  other intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at  each reporting date. C.10   P rovisions and Contingent  liabilities/assets l   Provisions: Provisions are recognised when the Group has  a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a  result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits will  be required to settle the obligation and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the  obligation.  The amount recognised as a provision is the best  estimate of the consideration required to settle  the present obligation at the end of the reporting  period,  considering  the  risks  and  uncertainties  surrounding the obligation. Provisions are  determined  by  discounting  the  expected  future  cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current  market assessments of the time value of money  and the risks specific to the liability. l    C  ontingent liabilities/assets: A possible obligation that arises from past events  and the existence of which will be confirmed only  by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or  more uncertain future events not wholly within  the control of the Group or present obligation that  arises from past events where it is not probable  that an outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation;  or the amount of the obligation cannot be  measured with sufficient reliability are disclosed  as contingent liability and not provided for. Contingent assets are disclosed where an inflow  of  economic  benefits  is  probable.  Contingent  assets are not recognised in the consolidated  financial statements. C.11   F inance costs Finance costs include interest expense computed by applying  the effective interest rate on respective financial instruments  measured at amortised cost. Financial instruments include  bank  term  loans,  non-convertible  debentures,  commercial  papers  and  exchange  differences  arising  from  foreign  currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an  adjustment to the interest cost. Finance costs are charged to  the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period for  which they are incurred. C.12   I mpairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses on each reporting date whether there  is any indication that any property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets or group of assets, called Cash Generating  Units (CGU), may be impaired. If any such indication exists,  the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to  determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not  possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual  asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the  CGU to which the asset belongs. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement  of profit and loss to the extent, that asset’s carrying amount  exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is  higher than an asset’s fair value less the cost of disposal and  value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future  cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of  the time value of money and risk specific to the assets. If the  recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is  estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying  amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its  recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying  amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased  to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount such that  the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined if no impairment  loss had been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating  unit) in prior years. The reversal of an impairment loss is  recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. C.13   E mployee benefits expense  a.   S hort-term employee benefits Liabilities for employee benefits, including non-monetary  benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within  12 months after the end of the period in which the  employees render the related service, are the amounts  expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.  Short-term  employee  benefits  are  recognised  in  the  consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in  which the related service is rendered.  b.   L ong-term employee benefits The  expected  costs  of  other  long-term  employee  benefits,  such  as  long-term  service  incentive  plan  benefits (not being share-based payments), are accrued  over the requisite service period, which is typically the  vesting period. l   Post-employment benefits  l   Defined contribution plans A  defined  contribution  plan  is  a  post- employment  benefit  plan  under  which  an  entity pays fixed contributions into a separate  entity and will have no legal or constructive  obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations  for  contributions  to  defined  contribution  plans are recognised as an employee benefit  expense  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and loss in the periods during which  the related services are rendered by the  employees. The Group pays provident and other fund  contributions to publicly administered funds  as per related Government regulations. The  Group has no further obligation other than  the contributions payable to the respective  funds. l   Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment  benefit plan other than a defined contribution  plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of  defined benefit plans is calculated separately  for each plan annually by a qualified actuary  using  the  project  unit  credit  method  and  spread over the period during which the  benefit  is  expected  to  be  derived  from  employees’ services. Remeasurement gains or losses arising from  experience  adjustments  and  changes  in  actuarial assumptions are recognised directly  in other comprehensive income in the period  they occur and are subsequently transferred  to retained earnings. l   L eave encashment/compensated absences The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term  employee benefits other than post-employment  benefits  is  the  entitlement  to  compensated  absences.  The  expected  cost  of  accumulated  compensated absences is determined by actuarial  valuation using the projected unit credit method  for the unused entitlement accumulated at the  balance sheet date. The  benefits  are  discounted  using  the  market  yields at the end of the balance sheet date that  has terms approximating the terms of the related  obligation. Re-measurements resulting from  experience adjustments and changes in actuarial  assumptions are recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss. C.14   E arnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net  profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity  shares  outstanding  during  the  year,  adjusted  for  bonus  element in equity share. Diluted earnings per share adjusts  the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per  share to consider the conversion of all dilutive potential  equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  converted as at the beginning of the period unless issued at  a later date. 190 191 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 C.15   F oreign currencies transactions  and translation Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the  exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  are translated at the functional currency’s closing rates of  exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising  on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised  in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical  cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange  rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items  measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated  using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was  measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non- monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with  the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value  of the item. In the case of an asset, expense or income where a non- monetary advance is paid/received, the date of transaction  is the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If  there were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple  dates of transactions are determined for each payment or  receipt of advance consideration. C.16   O perating segments Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with  the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision  Maker (CODM) of the Group. The CODM is responsible for  allocating resources and assessing the performance of the  operating segments of the Group.  The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are  in conformity with the accounting policies of the Group.  Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets and  segment liabilities have been identified as segments on the  basis of their relationship to the operating activities of the  segment.  Revenue,  expenses,  assets  and  liabilities  which  are related to the Group as a whole and are not allocable to  segments on a reasonable basis have been included under  unallocable revenue/expenses/assets or liabilities. C.17    C  ontract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or  services to a customer for which the Group has received  consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from  the customer. If a customer pays consideration before  the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a  contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or  the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities  are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under  the contract. D.    C  ritical accounting judgements  and key sources of estimations  uncertainty The  preparation  of  the  Group’s  financial  statements  requires management to make judgements, estimates and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amount  of  revenue,  expenses,  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  accompanying  disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could  result  in  outcomes  that  require  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amount  of  assets  or  liabilities  affected  in  the  subsequent  financial  year.  Accounting  estimates  and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions of estimates are recognised prospectively. D.1   P rovisions and contingent  liabilities The timing of recognition and quantification of the provisions,  contingent  liabilities/assets  require  the  application  of  judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which are  subject to change on the actual occurrence or happening.  Judgement is required for estimating the possible outflow  of  resources,  if  any,  in  respect  of  contingencies/claims/ litigations against the Group and possible inflow of resources  in respect of the claims made by the Group which has been  considered to be contingent in nature. These are reviewed at  each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current  best estimates.  D.2   I mpairment of financial assets The measurement of impairment losses across all categories  of financial assets requires judgement and the estimation of  the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining  impairment  losses  and  the  assessment  of  a  significant  increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by several  factors, changes in which can result in different levels of  allowances. It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review  its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust  when necessary. D.3   F air value measurement The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in  an active market and cannot be measured based on quoted  prices in active markets are determined using valuation  techniques,  including  the  Discounted  Cash  Flow  (DCF)  model. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of  methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on  market conditions at regular intervals. The inputs to these models are taken from observable  markets  where  possible  but  where  this  is  not  feasible,  a  degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values.  Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about  these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial  instruments. D.4   D efined benefit plans (gratuity  benefits) The  Group’s  retirement  benefit  obligations,  cost  of  the  defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the  gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions  that may differ from actual developments in the future. These  include  the  determination  of  the  discount  rate,  inflation,  future salary increments and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities  involved  in  the  valuation  and  its  long-term  nature,  a  defined  benefit  obligation  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed  at each reporting date. D.5   I ncome Taxes Availability of future tax profit against which the tax losses  carried forward can be used. E.

The Group has not disclosed fair values for Cash and Cash equivalents, Bank balances other than Cash and Cash equivalents, Other  financial assets, Trade Payables and Other financial liabilities as they are all considered to be of short duration and carrying value are  assumed to be approximate to their fair value.  The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value measurements as described  below.  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Valuation Methodology All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below: The fair value of investment in quoted Equity shares, Bonds, Government securities, Treasury bills, Certificate of deposit, Commercial paper  and Mutual funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.

The Board of Directors has established the Group Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for overseeing  development and monitoring the risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.  Risk management involves identifying, measuring, monitoring and managing risks on a regular basis. To achieve this objective, the  Parent Company employs leading risk management practices and recruits experienced people. The risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and  controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes  in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to  maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Audit Committee of the Parent Company oversees how management monitors compliance with the risk management policies  and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit  Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management  controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors have constituted Group Risk Management Committee. The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board  in its oversight of various risks (i) Credit Risk (ii) Market risk (iii) Interest rate risk (iv) Liquidity Risk (v) Operational Risk. Different type of risk the Group is exposed are as under: (i) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual  obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivable from customers, loans and investments in debt securities. a)    C  ash & Cash equivalents and other bank balances The Group holds Cash & Cash equivalents and other bank balances aggregating ₹ 4,071.78 crore (previous year ₹10,959.77  crore). The credit worthiness of such banks and financial institutions is evaluated by the management on an ongoing basis and  is considered to be good. b)   Investments The Group had limited its exposure to credit risk by investing in money market instruments that have an investment grade credit  rating. The Group monitors changes in credit risk by tracking external credit ratings.  c)   L oans and other receivables The Group Company involved in lending to customers has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification  of possible changes in the credit worthiness of counterparties. The credit quality review process aims to allow the Group to  assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective action. Classification of financial assets under various stages Financial assets where no significant increase in credit risk has been observed are considered to be in ‘Stage 1’ for which a 12-month  Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is recognised. Financial assets that are considered to have significant increase in credit risk are considered  to be in ‘Stage 2’ and those which are in default or for which there is objective evidence of impairment are considered to be in ‘Stage  3’. Lifetime ECL is recognised for Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial assets. Lifetime ECL is also recognised for trade receivables. Impairment assessment The Group calculates impairment on financial instruments as per ECL approach prescribed under Ind AS 109 ‘Financial instrument’.  ECL uses three main components: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) along with an  adjustment considering forward macro-economic conditions. The Group Company involved in lending to customers recalibrates components of its ECL model periodically by; (1) using the available  incremental and recent information, except where such information does not represent the future outcome and (2) assessing changes  to its statistical techniques for a granular estimation of ECL. Inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used for estimating ECL Significant increase in credit risk - The Group continuously monitors all assets subject to ECL in order to determine whether an  instrument or a portfolio of instruments is subject to 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL. If the contractual payments are more than 30 days  past due, then the credit risk is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition. Probability of default - PD is calculated on the basis of the likelihood that the borrower will default within one-year horizon (Basis for  Stage 1). The Group does not possess own historical default data for estimation of PD and thus uses the default rates published by  credit information companies/ credit rating agencies as a proxy. Loss given default - The LGD is an estimate of the loss arising in the case of default of a financial asset. LGD is generally computed  taking into consideration the time value of actual historical recovery experience of the Group on its defaulted accounts.

NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 NOTES     to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 historical recovery data, LGD percentage is determined based on guidelines prescribed by RBI for Banks under the FIRB (Foundation  Internal Rating Based) approach and through industry best practices as proxy. Exposure at default - EAD is the sum of outstanding principal and the interest amount accrued but not received on each loan as at  reporting date. EAD for non-funded exposure is generally computed after considering credit conversion factor (CCF). In order to  determine the EAD for undrawn loan commitments, group considers the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn  down within 12 months of the reporting date when estimating 12-month ECL and the expected portion of the loan commitment that will  be drawn down over the expected life of the loan commitment when estimating lifetime ECL. Forward looking information - The Group is required to provide for impairment allowance based on ECL, which is calculated  using empirical portfolio performance and adjusted for forward looking macroeconomic factors, as prescribed by Ind AS. The  overall provisioning made through this approach continues to be in excess of the floor provisions as prescribed by RBI for NBFCs.   The Group considers a broad range of forward-looking information with reference to external forecasts of various macro-economic  factors for example GDP growth, unemployment rates, Inflation etc., as considered relevant so as to determine the impact of macro- economic factors on the Group’s ECL estimates. The group appropriately adjusts the proxy PD to determine the forward-looking PD. Definition of default - The Group considers a financial asset to be in ‘default’ and therefore Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL  calculations when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.  As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that may  indicate unlikeliness to pay. When such events occur, the Group carefully considers whether the event should result in treating the  customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate.    C  oncentration of credit risk  The table below shows the credit quality based on credit concentration and the maximum exposure to credit risk based on the days  past due and year-end stage classification of Loans. The amounts presented are gross of impairment allowances.

This market is influenced by domestic/ international political, financial  and other events occurring on day-to-day basis. Hence the market is constantly volatile and uncertain. The Group has strong treasury  philosophies and practices and is well geared to meet the challenges of volatile market conditions. (iii)   I nterest rate risk Interest rate risk consists primarily of risk inherent in ALM activities and relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market  interest rates on future net interest income (NII). Since the group does not have any financial assets or liabilities bearing floating interest  rates any change in interest rates at the reporting date would not have significant impact on consolidated financial statements. The Group’s borrowings including debt securities for current year are ₹ 3,970.00 crore (Previous year NIL) from Bank/FI etc. (iv)   L iquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Group maintains  sufficient liquid assts to meet working capital requirements in the form of term deposit with banks and/ or in money market instruments  which can be liquidated on demand.  The Group’s financial liabilities consist mainly of accrued expenses and other liabilities which are  due within next twelve months from the reporting date.  The Group has sufficient funds to meet all maturing obligations. Liquidity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment  periods.  The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on  which the Group is required to pay.  ₹ in crore  Particulars As at 31 st  March, 2025 As at 31 st  March, 2024 Less than  1 year More than  1 year Total Less than  1 year More than  1 year Total Trade payables  33.30    -     33.30   16.27   -   16.27  Debt Securities  983.23    -     983.23    -     -    -    Borrowings (other than debt securities) 988.68  1,998.09   2,986.77    -     -    -    Other financial liabilities  373.73    -     373.73   96.44   -   96.44  Total 2,378.94 1,998.09  4,377.03   112.71   -   112.71  (v)   O perational risk Operational risk is the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events. The Group  manages operational risks through comprehensive internal control systems and procedures laid down around various key activities  in the Group viz. loan acquisition, customer service, IT operations, finance function etc.  Further IT and operations have a dedicated  compliance and control units within the function who on continuous basis review internal processes.  This enables the Management to  evaluate key areas of operational risks and the process to adequately mitigate them on an ongoing basis. 36   Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it continues as a going concern, while also maximising returns to stakeholders and maintaining  adequate liquidity to meet its obligations. Capital is managed prudently, with adjustments made as necessary in response to changes  in business conditions. The overall strategy remains consistent with the prior year. 37   Maturity analysis for assets and liabilities The table below shows the maturity analysis of assets and liabilities according to when they are expected to be recovered or settled.  ₹ in crore  Particulars As at 31 st  March, 2025 As at 31 st  March, 2024 Within 12  Months After 12  Months Total Within 12  Months After 12  Months Total ASSETS Financial assets Cash and Cash equivalents  352.32    -     352.32   67.18    -     67.18  Bank Balances other than Cash and Cash  equivalents  3,719.46    -     3,719.46   10,892.59    -     10,892.59  Trade Receivables  14.95    -     14.95   13.97    -     13.97  Loans  4,027.01   6,026.11   10,053.12   173.31    -     173.31  Investments 7,815.61 1,11,094.71  1,18,910.32   5,802.62   1,27,489.55   1,33,292.17  Other financial assets  50.80   36.56   87.36   106.99   10.80   117.79  Total financial assets 15,980.15  1,17,157.38   1,33,137.53   17,056.66  1,27,500.35   1,44,557.01  Non-financial assets Current Tax assets (net)   -     95.28   95.28    -     85.16   85.16  Deferred tax assets (net)   -     9.96   9.96    -     0.23   0.23  Property, Plant and Equipment   -     32.63   32.63    -     31.27   31.27  Capital Work-in-Progress   -     6.63   6.63    -      -      -    Intangible assets under development   -     7.84   7.84    -     3.43   3.43  Goodwill   -     100.48   100.48    -     100.48   100.48  Other Intangible assets   -     46.81   46.81    -     39.92   39.92  Other non-financial assets  72.78    -     72.78   45.49    -     45.49  Total non-financial assets  72.78   299.63   372.41   45.49   260.49   305.98  Total assets 16,052.93  1,17,457.01   1,33,509.94  17,102.15  1,27,760.84  1,44,862.99  LIABILITIES Financial liabilities Trade payables  33.30    -     33.30   16.27    -     16.27  Debt Securities  983.23    -     983.23    -      -      -    Borrowings (other than debt securities) 988.68 1,998.09  2,986.77    -      -      -    Other financial liabilities  373.73    -     373.73   96.44    -     96.44  Total financial liabilities  2,378.94  1,998.09   4,377.03   112.71    -     112.71  Non-financial liabilities Deferred tax liabilities (net)   -     5,565.01   5,565.01    -     5,557.61   5,557.61  Provisions 32.46  3.67   36.13   23.58   6.05   29.63  Other non-financial liabilities  35.25    -     35.25   15.38    -     15.38  Total non-financial liabilities  67.71 5,568.68  5,636.39   38.96   5,563.66   5,602.62  Total liabilities 2,446.65 7,566.77  10,013.42   151.67   5,563.66   5,715.33 214 215 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 JIO FINANCIAL SERVICES  LIMITED   l   ANNUAL  REPORT FY 2024-25 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY REPORTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW
