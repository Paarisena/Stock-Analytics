About Biocon Group 9 Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Generics   Business In FY25, Biocon Limited made a strategic entry into the high- impact therapeutic area of ‘diabesity,’ a growing global health  challenge, through the UK launch of generic Liraglutide. This  marked the first product launch from our portfolio of GLP-1  therapies. With rising global adoption of GLP-1 formulations,  which are redefining care for diabetes and obesity worldwide,  we signed licensing agreements in key geographies to accelerate  reach and expand access to these affordable therapies for patients. The Generics business gained regulatory approvals for injectable  products in the U.S., strengthening our near- and mid-term growth  pipeline. We navigated pricing pressures and demand contraction  in the early quarters and showed clear signs of recovery by the  end of the financial year, delivering 8% revenue growth. We  also successfully completed U.S. FDA inspections at four of our  manufacturing sites in India, underscoring our commitment to  quality and compliance. KEY HIGHLIGHTS    Launched generic Liraglutide in the UK under the brand names  Liraglutide Biocon for diabetes and Biolide for chronic weight  management.    Received the Decentralized Procedure or DCP approval for  generic Liraglutide in the EU for both diabetes and obesity  indications.    Commenced commercial supplies from our oral solid dosage  facility in Cranbury, New Jersey.    Successfully closed U.S. FDA inspections at two Bengaluru and  two Visakhapatnam API sites. Biosimilars   Business In FY25, Biocon Biologics marked the first anniversary of its  transformation into a fully integrated multi-cultural, multi- ethnic global enterprise. The year focused on consolidating the  acquired business across 120+ countries and leveraging our  unique vertically integrated model to drive profitable growth and  expand global reach. We accelerated access to our comprehensive  biosimilars portfolio for diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune  diseases, positively impacting the lives of over 5.8 million patients  worldwide. These efforts translated into significant market share  gains across key geographies. While driving growth, we also prioritized financial discipline,  focusing on improving liquidity and meeting debt obligations.  A key milestone was the successful USD 800 million benchmark  bond issuance, listed on the Singapore Exchange. Key regulatory  approvals, new product launches during the year, and several  upcoming product launches over the next 18 months, have laid  a strong foundation for the next phase of our strategic journey of  accelerating growth. KEY HIGHLIGHTS    Key products serve around one-fifth of patients in the U.S.  and have market-leading shares in several markets, including  Europe, Brazil, Mexico and Malaysia.    Refinanced debt through a USD 800 million bond issuance and  syndicated loan, strengthening liquidity and financial flexibility  for growth.    Launched Yesintek™ (bUstekinumab) in the U.S., our fifth  commercialized product and one of the first biosimilars of  Stelara® in the country. Yesintek™ also commercialized in  Germany and Japan; approved in UK and Europe.    Received U.S. FDA approval in April 2025 for Jobevne™, a  biosimilar of Avastin® (Bevacizumab), for treating various types  of cancer.    Received Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) status from U.S. FDA  for manufacturing facilities in India and Malaysia, enabling new  product approvals in the U.S. 155+ Generic Formulations &   APIs in Portfolio 125+ cGMP Approvals 420+ Global Customers 15.4+ Million, Patients Reached  Through API & Generic  Formulations 10 Biosimilars Commercialized 20 Biosimilars in Portfolio 90+ cGMP Approvals 120+ Countries Reached  Commercially 10 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Research & Manufacturing  Services Business In FY25, Syngene International made meaningful progress in  Accelerating Reach by broadening its scientific, geographic, and  technological horizons. Syngene’s Discovery Services vertical successfully converted the  majority of the pilot collaborations into long-term partnerships  with mid and large-cap clients, reinforcing its position as a  preferred global partner in the evolving ‘China Plus One’ landscape.  The Development and Manufacturing Services vertical delivered  steady performance driven by biologics with repeat orders from  existing customers and new collaborations on integrated projects. A robust balance sheet and strong net cash position enabled  Syngene to make strategic investments in commercial  manufacturing capabilities, new technology, and digitization.  To strengthen its capacity for large molecule manufacturing,  Syngene acquired its first biologics facility in the U.S. This strategic  investment reflects the Company’s commitment to advancing  pharmaceutical innovation and strengthening healthcare  collaboration between India and the U.S. To help clients expedite  the delivery of medicines to patients, Syngene launched a  new protein production platform that significantly reduces  development timelines for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), other  recombinant proteins, and antibody-drug conjugates. KEY HIGHLIGHTS    Acquired a state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility  equipped with mAbs manufacturing lines in the U.S.    Launched a new protein production platform that significantly  reduces development timelines for large molecule therapies,  accelerating their delivery to patients.    Emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based  Targets initiative (SBTi). KEY HIGHLIGHTS    Completed upsized Nasdaq IPO in Sept 2024, raising ~USD 362  million; trading under ticker BCAX.    Lead asset Ficerafusp alfa offers a dual-action approach to  EGFR+ tumors.    Novel immuno-oncology pipeline, incubated at Biocon in India,  gained global recognition. Novel Biologics   Business Itolizumab Itolizumab, the world’s first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody  that has been licensed to Equillium for specific markets in 2017,  made good progress in clinical trials related to severe immune- inflammatory diseases, including acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease  (aGVHD), lupus nephritis, and ulcerative colitis. Bicara Therapeutics Bicara Therapeutics, our former U.S.-based associate, completed an  upsized IPO on the Nasdaq in September 2024, raising ~USD 362  million. In FY25, Bicara’s shares began trading on the Nasdaq under  the ticker symbol “BCAX.” This milestone was a proud moment  for Biocon, as the novel immuno-oncology pipeline incubated  at Biocon gained international recognition and valuation.

CEO & MD’S  MESSAGE Siddharth Mittal Biocon Limited A Year of Successfully  Implementing Several  Key Initiatives 16 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Dear Shareholders, Since our inception in 1978, Biocon’s  journey has been marked by bold  choices and pioneering new paths.  What began with the manufacturing  of enzymes, paved the way for  diversification, first into APIs, then  Biosimilars and Novel Biologics,  and more recently into Finished  Dosage Formulations. This spirit of  consistently pushing boundaries to  do things differently continues to  shape our strategies, positioning us  strongly in terms of size, scale and  portfolio, to accelerate reach and  take our high-quality drug products  to the world’s most underserved  populations. At the Group level, the fiscal year  under review, FY25, saw revenues from  operations grow by 10% on a like-for-like  basis to  H 152,617 million*. This was led by  a 15%* growth in our Biosimilars business,  with the Generics businesses and Research  Services revenues growing by 8% and  4%, respectively. The Group’s reported  net profit was  H 10,133 million, which is a  significant turnaround on a comparable  like-for-like basis, when adjusted for  revenues and divestment of our Branded  Formulations India business in Biosimilars,  as well as the dilution and fair value gain  in Bicara. I will now present a comprehensive  overview of the key highlights of the  Generics business over the past year. *Like-for-like basis, adjustment for sales from Branded  Formulations Unit, India (BFI), BFI divestment gain,  and forex/ derivative accounting. Total Income was  H 164,699 million. Generics The Generics business concluded the  year with an 8% growth in FY25 over the  previous year. This growth stemmed from  new drug product launches in the second  half of the year and a consistent full-year  performance from our API business,  supported by cost and operational  improvement initiatives that aided volume  growth. While the full-year’s financial  performance was supported by the launch  of Lenalidomide in the U.S. in the fourth  quarter, a clear strategic highlight of FY25  was the launch our first GLP-1 formulation,  Liraglutide, in the United Kingdom. As you may recall, we had identified  eight strategic priorities to drive our  growth and expansion: Development  Excellence, Operational Excellence, Quality  Excellence, Commercial Excellence, Cost  Leadership, Innovation Focus, Talent  Development and Digital Initiatives. These  priorities encompass the entire business  life cycle with the objective of bringing  our complex products, including GLP-1s,  to market at the right time and right  cost. During the year, we successfully  implemented several initiatives based  on these priorities, some of which I will  touch upon further in this message. I am  confident that their impact will be seen in  the years ahead. Commercial Reach We had two important U.S. launches  in FY25: Lenalidomide, used to treat  types of multiple myeloma, mantle  cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma,  marginal zone lymphoma, and anaemia  in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in  adults; and Dasatinib tablets, used in the  treatment of Philadelphia chromosome  positive myeloid leukaemia in adults. The  other significant highlight was the launch  of gLiraglutide for diabetes and obesity in  the United Kingdom, marking a significant  milestone for the Company, after being  the first to receive approval for this drug in  a major regulated market. We also secured  Decentralized Process approval (DCP) for  gLiraglutide, which now opens the doors  for us to market it in various EU markets,  as we look to leverage our early mover  position in this space. We entered into strategic partnerships  in various MOW markets. We signed a  semi-exclusive distribution and supply  agreement with speciality pharmaceutical  companies in Mexico, South Korea, Brazil,  and select countries within the Middle  East, to commercialize products from our  GLP-1 portfolio. Innovation Focus and  Development Excellence Our sustained R&D efforts to build a strong  pipeline of complex products made  considerable progress during the year.  We filed as many as 108 dossiers for our  generic formulation products across the  U.S., EU and MOW markets, and 66 Drug  Master Files for our APIs. We secured several approvals in the U.S.:  From our injectables portfolio, Micafungin,  Daptomycin, and Norepinephrine  Bitartrate-used in managing fungal  infections, skin infections, and acute  hypotension respectively, were approved.  We secured approvals for Sacubitril/ We  had two important U.S. launches in  FY25: Lenalidomide, used to treat types of  multiple myeloma, and Dasatinib tablets,  used in the treatment of Philadelphia  chromosome positive myeloid leukaemia  in adults. The launch of gLiraglutide for  diabetes and obesity in the United Kingdom  marked a significant milestone for the  Company. We secured several approvals in  the U.S. for our injectables portfolio.

Valsartan tablets used to treat chronic  heart failure in adults, and Triamterene  capsules, a diuretic used in the treatment  of hypertension. We also received final  approval of our ANDA for Rivaroxaban  Tablets. Our Cranbury facility in the U.S. received  regulatory approvals for variations filed for  three key statin products, with commercial  supplies from the site having commenced  during FY25. Tacrolimus, our immunosuppressant  product used in the treatment of organ  transplant patients, was approved by the  South African Health Products Regulatory  Authority as well as the National Medical  Products Administration in China.  Commercial supplies of the product to  China commenced during the year. Quality Excellence Our manufacturing sites underwent  several regulatory inspections as part of  new product approvals, or verification of  compliance. The successful outcome of  these inspections demonstrates Biocon’s  strong quality systems. The U.S. FDA conducted a pre-approval  inspection at our Site-6 in Visakhapatnam.  We responded to the observations and  received the Establishment Inspection  Report (EIR), which cleared the way for  us to supply products from the facility to  the U.S. market. Site-5 in Visakhapatnam,  as well as Sites 1 and 2 in Bengaluru  underwent regulatory inspections by the  U.S. FDA, with EIRs received for all three  sites. We also had successful audits by the  Brazilian Health Agency, ANVISA, of our  Site-3 in Hyderabad and the formulations  facility at Site-2 in Bengaluru. Operational Excellence,  Cost Leadership and Digital  Initiatives As a part of our efforts to drive operational  excellence, we initiated capacity  enhancement projects at multiple  manufacturing sites. Let me summarise  the progress we made on these projects  during the year: At our injectables site in Bengaluru,  qualification of the facility is underway,  which we expect to be completed by the  end of FY26, followed by the initiation of  regulatory clearance activities. Commercial production has commenced  at our new large volume peptides facility  in Bengaluru, with validation of scaled-up  capacity underway. At our non-immunosuppressants facility  in Bengaluru, four blocks have been  completed, with the remaining currently  in the major equipment receipt stage. In Hyderabad, the validation of our API  facility with fully integrated MES has been  completed for three products, with work  in progress on the balance. Our oral solid dosage facility at  Cranbury in the U.S. saw three products  commercialized from phase 1 of the  facility. As part of our expansion plans  there, major construction has been  completed for phase 2 and the equipment  qualification process is underway. This  expansion will help us cater to the  demand for our portfolio of products in  the region, enabling us to better serve  customers and patients. During the year, we continued our journey  in operational and process excellence, and  the adoption of digitalization across our  business. To enhance efficiency and decision- making, we adopted Lean and Six  Sigma methodologies to streamline  production processes and reduce waste.  We continued to invest in advanced  automation and digital transformation  tools, such as real-time data analytics and  AI-driven supply chain management. We  also conducted comprehensive training  programs to empower our workforce  with the skills necessary for continuous  improvement and innovation. We went live with several key digital  initiatives such as the Regulatory  Information Management System for  Generic Formulations, the Formulations  Analytical Request and Report (ARR)  module in the R&D Workbench, Phase 2  As  a part of our  efforts to drive  operational excellence,  we initiated capacity  enhancement  projects at multiple  manufacturing sites.

Through these initiatives, we aim to  cultivate a high-performance work culture  with highly enabled, empowered, and  accountable employees. Our Employee  Satisfaction survey for FY25 boasted a  93% overall satisfaction score, with 89%  participation from the Generics business  workforce. We have a special focus on gender  diversity and implemented several  programs that aim to increase the number  of women employees at Biocon. I am  pleased to report that our gender diversity  grew to 21% this year, as against 17.6% in  the previous fiscal. I am also proud to inform you that we  were ranked 9 th  on U.S.-based  Science   magazine’s list of top 20 global employers  in biotech, which testifies to the quality of  our people practices. ESG (Environmental, Social and  Governance) also ranks high amongst  our priorities. We have established a  comprehensive sustainability strategy  with clearly articulated goals aimed  at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions, minimizing waste generated  from operations, and conserving  freshwater resources. Over the past year,  we implemented several projects and  initiatives designed to decrease our  carbon footprint and achieve a ‘zero  waste’ status through effective recycling  and reuse practices. For a comprehensive  understanding of our efforts to integrate  sustainable practices across our value  chain, I encourage you to explore the  detailed descriptions of these initiatives  presented in the ‘Natural Capital’ section of  this report. I am pleased to report that our ESG  score rose from 63 to 69 as assessed by  the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability  Assessment (CSA), which places us  in the 98 th  percentile among global  biotechnology peers. Biocon was also  included in the S&P Global Yearbook for  the third consecutive year. In the 2024  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) report,  Biocon maintained its climate change  score and water security score at “B” and  “C” respectively. Notably, in the most  recent Ecovadis Corporate Sustainability  Assessment, published in June 2025,  Biocon achieved a score increase from  70 to 77, earning us the distinction of  a gold rating and reflecting our strong  commitment to sustainability. Looking Ahead We continue to build a platform that will  take Biocon to the next level. With our  eight strategic priorities clearly in our lens,  we are now poised to enter a period of  sustained growth that will deliver greater  value to all our stakeholders. Our focus continues to be in areas  where we have a clear and proven edge,  namely complex products that are tough  to develop and manufacture, such as  peptides, especially GLP-1 agonists,  fermentation API, HPAPI and complex  injectables. Our thrust also continues  on regional expansion, either directly or  through strategic partnerships, enhancing  capacities, optimising costs, fortifying  our supply chain and accelerating the  digitalisation of our operations. Needless  to say, our commitment to the highest  standards of corporate governance and  sustainability continues unabated. I would now like to acknowledge the  steadfast efforts of every Biocon employee  during the past year. It is their unflagging  dedication and commitment to our  business goals that propels us on our  mission to make high-quality medicines  accessible and affordable to more patients  across the world. I also take this opportunity to convey my  sincere gratitude to you, our esteemed  shareholders, for your enduring  confidence in Biocon, as we remain  focused on driving the company’s  sustained growth and strategic progress.

CEO & MD’S  MESSAGE Shreehas Tambe Biocon Biologics FY25: Advancing  Reach and Innovation  to Build Global  Leadership 20 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Dear Shareholders, Financial year 2025 (FY25) has  been yet another remarkable  year for Biocon Biologics, one  that established us as one of the  top global leading biosimilars  companies. It marked our first  full year as a fully integrated,  multinational biopharmaceutical  enterprise with a presence in over  120 countries. We have successfully  evolved from a development and  manufacturing-focused organization  to a lab-to-market biopharma leader,  driven by innovation, global scale,  and an unwavering commitment to  health equity. This progress has been guided by our  strategic framework that I had shared  earlier: Preserve, Consolidate, Accelerate.  Having successfully integrated the  acquired biosimilars business in FY24  (Preserve) in record time, our efforts in  FY25 were focused on Consolidation  - advancing our research programs,  strengthening our execution capability,  building customer confidence, and, very  importantly, greater fiscal discipline. I am  happy to report that these initiatives in  FY25 have firmly positioned us as we now  embark on the Accelerate phase in FY26  and beyond. Evolving Healthcare Landscape Global healthcare costs continue to index  on managing non-communicable diseases  such as cancer and diabetes, which now  account for over 70% of global deaths  and related co-morbidities. Biologics  have become the standard of care for  these debilitating health conditions.  Biosimilars are increasingly recognized as  being essential to broadening access and  controlling healthcare costs. Policymakers worldwide too are  responding with supportive regulations  as they look to manage burgeoning  healthcare budgets, creating a fertile  environment for biosimilar adoption.  Consequently, the global biosimilars  market, valued at USD 23 billion in 2024,  is projected to triple by 2029. At Biocon  Biologics, our robust R&D pipeline, strong  global supply network, and expanding  advocacy efforts uniquely position us to  lead this transformation. Continuing Regulatory and  Operational Excellence In FY25, we successfully secured over  50 product approvals across 34 global  markets, including key products like  Yesintek™ (bUstekinumab) in the U.S. and  EU and Jobevne™ (bBevacizumab) in the  U.S. Strategic settlements with Janssen  and Regeneron for Yesintek and Yesafili™  (bAflibercept) respectively, have further  enabled early market access across major  geographies. Our manufacturing sites in India and  Malaysia received Voluntary Action  Indicated (VAI) classifications from the  U.S. FDA — a significant milestone  that enables us to bring more product  offerings to patients in the United States  of America. Meanwhile, we continued to  expand capacity at our insulins facility  in Malaysia to meet the rising global  demand for diabetes therapies, while also  strengthening our globally distributed  supply chain for long-term resilience. Scaling Commercial  Performance Our business in the U.S. delivered a strong  performance with the Oncology franchise  leading the way. Market shares for Ogivri®  (bTratuzumab) more than doubled,  rising to 26% from 12%, while Fulphila®  (bPegfilgrastim) increased to 30%,  consolidating our position as the market  leader. Market shares of our Semglee® and  Insulin Glargine franchise continue to be  in mid-to-high-teens across all channels.  In Q4FY25, we launched Yesintek™, a  biosimilar to Janssen’s Stelara® with strong  formulary coverage enabling access to  100+ million patients. In Europe, products like Ogivri® and  Abevmy® (bBevacizumab) expanded  market share in key countries including  the UK, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany.  Across Emerging Markets, we retained  market leadership in several geographies  and continued to expand our reach. These achievements are particularly  commendable, given the post-integration  phase and the ongoing global economic  volatility. Biocon Biologics  delivered  strong growth with Revenue from Operations  at  H 90,174 million, up a healthy 15% from FY24  on a like-to-like basis. EBITDA stood at  H 19,710  million after excluding any one-time gains,  reflecting a healthy margin of 22%. The R&D  investments stood at 7% of revenue in-line with  industry standards.

CEO & MD’S  MESSAGE Peter Bains Syngene A Year of Growth  and Expanding  Our Reach Leadership Messages 23 Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Dear Shareholders, Let me first say how honoured I am  to be back at Syngene after almost  10 years, and it is especially exciting  to return at such a dynamic time in  the CRDMO industry and to have  the opportunity to contribute to  Syngene’s on-going growth story. I am pleased to report another successful  year of growth, innovation and expanding  our reach for our customers. Our focus this  year was on strengthening our capabilities  to support the needs of our customers  and to augment our capacity to fulfil  existing and future demand. We continued  to expand on our capability platforms at  our Bengaluru and Hyderabad campuses,  successfully completed inspections for  our Biologics Unit III and in a significant  strategic initiative, acquired our first U.S.- based biologics manufacturing site. Performance this year As we had guided, FY25 was a challenging  year of two distinct halves. In the first  half, performance was muted driven by a  sectoral downturn in U.S. biotech funding  that affected our Discovery Services  division, while in the second half we saw a  recovery in Discovery Services as funding  returned, building on top of growth  momentum in both our small and large  molecule manufacturing divisions. Overall,  we delivered a resilient performance in a  challenging year. A key dynamic for the year was the  marked increase in customer RFP’s as they  explored alternative options to rebalance  their CRDMO business exposure away  from China. Typically, these customers set  up ‘pilot studies’ across a range of services,  often placing them with a select short  list of companies. The pilot studies are  then used as the basis for customers to  select longer term partners to undertake  more substantial program work. I am  very pleased to report that Syngene has  been achieving a high success rate of  conversion and that the pipeline of pilot  studies has a good momentum going into  FY26. Within the CRDMO market, the large  molecule CDMO segment has been  the fastest growing, driven by the rapid  expansion of, and increasing demand  for, biologics and monoclonal antibodies  to treat cancer and immunological  diseases. Syngene identified this area as  an opportunity for growth and in the  last few years we have made sustained  investments to build a strategic large  molecule platform capability. This year, we  continued our investment commitment  to scale up our biologics manufacturing  capacity through the acquisition of a  facility in Baltimore, Maryland, which is a  key biotech hub in the Northeast of the  U.S. Highlights of the year included    The acquisition of Syngene’s first U.S.- based biologics site is expected to support  monoclonal antibody manufacturing  from the second half of FY26. This site  will increase the Company’s total single- use bioreactor capacity to 50,000L for  large molecule discovery, development,  and manufacturing services and also  provides a strategic foothold in the U.S.  customer market. The Company also  completed successful CDSCO and local  FDA inspections for its Biologics Unit III in  Bengaluru.    Introduction of a protein production  platform reducing development  timelines by several months for a range  of biologics—including monoclonal  antibodies, biosimilars, antibody-drug  conjugates, and other recombinant  proteins—enabling improved speed of  delivery to our customers. SYNGENE CEO & MD’S MESSAGE Our  focus this year  was on strengthening  our capabilities to  support the needs of  our customers and to  augment our capacity  to fulfil existing and  future demand. 24 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

   Expansion of capacity and capabilities  in Discovery Services continued at the  Bengaluru and Hyderabad campuses, with  a focus on antibody-drug conjugates,  peptides, and oligonucleotides, in  anticipation of long-term demand.    China-independent supply chain  development continued through strategic  sourcing from the Indian ecosystem and  engagement with global suppliers to  establish operations in India. Introduced  18 months ago, the offering has gained  traction, with approximately one-third of  RFPs opting for the China-independent  supply model.    Achievement of 5S certification  marked a milestone as Syngene became  the first company in the Indian pharma  and life sciences industry to receive  this recognition for its biologics quality  control laboratory. Awarded through a  joint evaluation by the Union of Japanese  Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) and the  Quality Circle Forum of India (QCFI), the  certification reflects improved workplace  organization, enhanced safety, increased  productivity, and strengthened quality  control.    Securing of a Silver rating on the  EcoVadis sustainability index placed the  Company in the top 15% of assessed  companies. Scope 1 and 2 targets were  approved by the Science Based Targets  initiative (SBTi) as aligned with the 1.5°C  trajectory, with commitments to reduce  emissions by 54.6% by FY33 and ensure  81.6% of key suppliers adopt science- based targets by FY28. Future outlook Looking forward, it is clear that we face  a period that will be characterized by a  higher degree of unpredictability and  turbulence driven by shifting global  geopolitics and geoeconomics. These  dynamics will likely influence and shape  the balance of headwinds and tailwinds  Syngene will face as we seek to continue  our growth story in the CRDMO market. Notwithstanding this backdrop, the  fundamentals of market opportunity for  Syngene remain very robust. Syngene’s  share of the global CRDMO market is  currently less than 1%, indicating clear  headroom for growth and market share  expansion. India itself is also now clearly  seen as a global ‘growth platform’ as  revealed in a BCG white paper titled,  ‘Unleashing the Tiger: Indian CRDMO  Sector 2025 presented at the BioAsia  conference in Hyderabad in February  this year. Today, India holds only a 2-3%  share, or USD 3.6 billion, of the USD 145  billion global CRDMO market. But, as the  report indicates there is potential for the  Indian industry to grow to USD 22-25  billion by 2035, representing a 15% CAGR,  outpacing global industry growth fuelled  by its increasing capabilities, enhanced  capacities, faster startup times and cost  advantage over the West.

Governance,  Ethics and Compliance At Biocon, governance is rooted in ethical leadership, accountability, and a commitment to  regulatory compliance. The governance structure, anchored by the independent Boards and  Executive Leadership Teams of Biocon Limited, Biocon Biologics, and Syngene, enables clear  separation of oversight and management responsibilities. A well-established framework of policies and controls supports ethical conduct, risk management, and transparent decision-making.  Core values such as integrity, fairness, and responsibility guide everyday actions and long-term strategies. This structured approach to  governance not only strengthens internal trust but also reinforces confidence among external stakeholders, including patients, partners,  investors, and employees, ensuring Biocon Group’s sustained growth and responsible value creation. Corporate Governance Board Oversight Biocon Limited, Biocon Biologics, and  Syngene each operate under distinct  independent Boards of Directors,  structured under a One-Tier Board system  that emphasizes strong governance,  transparency, and independent  oversight. In accordance with the  regulatory framework prescribed by  the Securities and Exchange Board of  India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure  Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (SEBI  Listing Regulations), at least 50% of  Biocon Limited and Syngene members  and 44% of Biocon Biologics members  are Independent Directors. This structure  ensures that strategic decisions are  guided by unbiased and experienced  perspectives, reinforcing accountability  and long-term value creation. The Chairperson of the Biocon Group  provides unified strategic leadership.  However, the roles of the Chairperson  and CEOs are distinct and separate. The  Chairperson focuses on overseeing the  Group’s strategic direction, while the  CEOs of Biocon Limited, Biocon Biologics,  and Syngene are responsible for the  operational activities of their respective  business units. This clear separation of  roles ensures a balance of power and  fosters effective governance across the  Group. To further enhance independent  oversight and ensure objective decision- making, a Lead Independent Director  has been appointed, reinforcing Board  independence and promoting impartial  leadership. 34 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited

Risk Management We view risk management as a strategic  priority vital to building resilience, agility,  and long-term performance. Given the  diversity across Biocon Limited, Biocon  Biologics, and Syngene, each entity  applies tailored frameworks suited to its  operational context. We foster a strong risk-aware culture  that proactively identifies and mitigates  risks across economic, geopolitical,  technological, and ESG dimensions. Our  Enterprise Risk Management framework,  overseen by the Risk Management  Committee, ensures structured evaluation  and timely decision-making. Through clear accountability, active  monitoring, and transparent reporting,  we drive a forward-looking approach  that strengthens resilience and supports  sustainable growth. For more details refer to Risks, Threats, and Concerns  in the Management Discussion and Analysis section  of the report. Risk Governance (Biocon Limited) Our Approach to Risk Management Process Biocon has instituted a robust and evolving risk management process to identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate, and monitor risks that could  impact business continuity, strategy execution, and stakeholder value. The process is anchored in four key steps: This approach is embedded into daily operations to ensure agility, ownership, and responsiveness. The Executive Leadership Team (ELT)  plays a central role in evaluating and updating the risk landscape, while the Risk Management Committee (RMC) is apprised on a quarterly  and annual basis of critical risk developments. At Biocon Limited and Biocon Biologics, the respective Heads of Governance, Risk, and  Compliance (GRC) serve as the designated Chief Risk Officers (CROs). They are the central point for consolidating risk inputs, coordinating  mitigation actions, and overseeing risk governance. Syngene’s risk management framework is reviewed regularly under a governance  process involving the Executive Risk Committee and the Risk Management Committee under the Board. Department/ Functions Head I Department/ Functions Head II Head, Governance Risk & Compliance Executive Leadership Team Risk Management Committee Board of Directors Risk Management Structure The Three Lines of Defence Department/ Functions Head III Business  functions and  unit heads  own and  implement risk  controls. 1 The Risk Management  Committee and  Executive Leadership,  supported by the  Chief Risk Officer,  sets the framework,  defines the approach,  and oversees risk  activities. 2 Internal or  external  auditors provide  independent  assurance that  risk practices align  with the Group’s  strategy and  policies. 3 For detailed roles and responsibilities of each governance structure, refer to the Risks, Threats, and Concerns in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of this report. 1 Risk Identification  and Assessment 2 Risk Prioritization   3 Risk Mitigation   4 Risk Monitoring and  Reporting 40 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

1 Risk Identification and Assessment The risk identification process is designed  to proactively capture significant risks  that may impact business objectives.  This includes evaluating financial  statements, operational processes,  workforce management practices, and  market, economic, and regulatory trends.  Emerging global risks, such as climate  change, cyber threats, and geopolitical  shifts, are also monitored. A centralized Risk Library/Register,  regularly updated by management across  functions, serves as the single source  of truth for enterprise-wide risks. These  are categorized under a comprehensive  Risk Classification Framework to facilitate  systematic mitigation planning and  optimal resource allocation. 2 Risk Prioritization Risks are prioritized based on their  inherent impact and likelihood of  occurrence. These are assessed along  three dimensions:    Significance of the impact (financial and  non-financial)    Likelihood of occurrence    Effectiveness of existing mitigation  plans Residual risk ratings are derived to  focus strategic responses. The Executive  Leadership Team conducts an annual  prioritization of all risks listed in the Risk  Register, while emerging risks are reviewed  and rated during quarterly meetings. This  prioritization process is strengthened  by each business’s defined risk appetite,  guiding the urgency and type of action  required. A robust rating system combining  qualitative and quantitative thresholds is  used to assign gross and net risk ratings.  Mitigation effectiveness is evaluated for:    Less Effective    Partially Effective    Mostly Effective Residual exposure is computed by  mapping gross risk against mitigation  effectiveness to drive risks to acceptable  levels. 3 Risk Mitigation Upon identification and prioritization,  structured mitigation strategies are  formulated. These are tailored to the  severity and likelihood of each risk,  aligned with the Group’s risk appetite and  integrated into daily operations. Key principles of mitigation include:    Documenting mitigation strategies and  assigning ownership    Ensuring maker-checker mechanisms  for accountability    Monitoring the implementation status  and adjusting as needed    Revising plans in response to internal or  external developments Risk mitigation efforts are led by  department heads and function owners,  supported by the Head of Governance  Risk and Compliance (GRC) and  governance teams. At Biocon Biologics,  this responsibility is similarly driven  by department and function leaders,  supported by the head of GRC. This  approach fosters a culture of proactive  risk awareness and responsiveness across  Biocon Limited, Biocon Biologics, and  Syngene. Key activities in risk identification and  assessment include:    Reviewing internal and external inputs,  such as audits, assessments, and  stakeholder insights    Recognizing emerging risks with long- term impact    Applying scenario planning, expert  consultation. Biocon Limited uses digital  tools to track progress on risk mitigation  plans    Categorizing risks using a standard  taxonomy to ensure functional  consistency Our Risk Universe includes: Extended Enterprise Sectoral Executional/Operational Strategic Financial and Reputational Regulatory and Statutory Information Technology and  Cybersecurity ESG/Sustainability Governance, Ethics and Compliance 41 Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

4 Risk Monitoring and Reporting Risk monitoring is conducted across all  levels of the organization and includes  regular updates to the Risk Register and  mitigation plans. The Risk Management  Committee receives a comprehensive  report on the Group’s risk profile on a  quarterly basis, and an annual review is  conducted by the Board of Directors and  ELT. The Heads of GRC (for Biocon Limited  and Biocon Biologics) play a pivotal role  in maintaining oversight and reporting.  Monitoring activities include:    Tracking the effectiveness of mitigation  actions    Identifying potential exposures and risk  mitigation gaps    Utilizing expert input, self-assessment  tools, and external insights    Reporting emerging risks and updating  prioritization ratings Additionally, a Business Continuity Plan  (BCP) is integrated within Syngene’s risk  management framework to support  resilience against potential disruptions. At  Biocon Limited, a high-level BCP is already  in place, and detailed operational-level  BCPs exist for our manufacturing sites. Risk Culture To foster a strong risk culture across the  organization, we conduct awareness  programs for relevant stakeholders,  emphasizing the importance of effective  risk management. These initiatives  encourage continuous feedback and  support ongoing improvements in our risk  management systems and processes. For more details, refer to the ‘Snapshot of Group’s  Comprehensive Risk Culture’ section of our FY25 BRSR  & ESG Data Book. Our Key Risks and Opportunities  at a Group Level In an evolving global landscape, we  proactively manage risks and pursue  emerging opportunities to ensure  long-term growth and resilience. Across  Biocon Limited, Biocon Biologics, and  Syngene, we assess business operations to  identify risks and apply robust mitigation  strategies, while also unlocking value  through strategic opportunities along the  value chain. Our integrated, forward-looking approach  strengthens core capabilities and sharpens  competitive advantage. A structured  risk management framework supports  systematic identification, evaluation, and  mitigation of sector-specific and strategic  risks. The summary below outlines  key risks, reviewed regularly by our  management and the Risk Management  Committee.

Identification of Material Topics In FY25, Biocon and Biocon Biologics continued to build on the  robust materiality foundation established during the FY24 review.  Given the comprehensive nature of the previous year’s assessment  conducted in response to significant strategic shifts, including the  acquisition of the Viatris biosimilars business, we determined that  the existing materiality framework remains current and relevant.  The FY24 assessment revisited the 30 topics identified in FY22,  expanded our lens to include 14 additional topics, and aligned  closely with global benchmarks and standards such as GRI, MSCI,  and SASB. As there have been no material changes to our business  model, stakeholder expectations, or operating context in FY25,  we have retained this validated framework to ensure continuity,  comparability, and consistency in ESG strategy and reporting. This  materiality framework excludes Syngene, which operates under a  different business model and is a separately listed entity. 50 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Top 5  Material Topics  in FY25 2. Stakeholder Engagement To ensure our assessment reflected  diverse perspectives, we engaged a broad  spectrum of stakeholders, including  Board Members, Executive Leadership,  employees, suppliers, investors, analysts,  business partners, media, healthcare  professionals, and financial institutions.  Stakeholders were invited to evaluate the  relevance of each topic from two lenses: Outside-in (Financial Materiality) : The  impact of ESG issues on our business Inside-out (Impact Materiality) : The  impact of our business on society and the  environment To maintain alignment with the  methodology and outcomes of the FY22  materiality assessment, the evaluation was  conducted separately for Board Members,  the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), and  other stakeholders. The top five topics  identified by each group from the 14  considered were as follows: 3. Prioritization of Material  Topics We analyzed stakeholder responses  using a structured scoring methodology,  prioritizing topics based on average  rankings across diverse groups, including  senior leaders and external stakeholders.  This approach ensured a balanced and  inclusive perspective. In the final step  of the assessment, we mapped the  prioritized topics into broad sustainability  themes. Building on the original 11  themes defined in the FY22 assessment,  we refined the framework by renaming  certain themes for improved clarity and  relevance. Additionally, we introduced  Climate Risk as a new standalone theme  reflecting its increasing significance to  our operations and global sustainability  priorities, bringing the total to 12 themes  in FY24. 4. Action Plan The outcomes of this assessment  guide our ESG strategy and disclosure  approach. We use the material themes  to shape our sustainability priorities,  define action plans, and set performance  indicators. These themes also influence  our risk management, business  continuity planning, and stakeholder  communication. By embedding  materiality into our operational and  strategic decisions, we ensure that we stay  responsive to emerging ESG challenges  and opportunities. 14 Additional Material Topics Identified in FY24 1 Integrated Risk  Management  & Business  Continuity 8 Digital Ethics /  Responsible AI 2 Environmental  Impact of  Products 9 Green  Chemistry 3 STEM Talent  Pipeline 10 Responsible  Public Advocacy 4 Climate Risks  (Physical and  Transition) 11 Ethical Clinical  Trials and  Animal Testing 5 Strengthening  Health Systems 12 Circular  Economy 6 Biodiversity and  Nature Risks 13 Pharmaceuticals  in the  Environment 7 Patient  Experience,  Health  Awareness/  Prevention 14 Antimicrobial  Resistance Other Stakeholders Integrated Risk Management &  Business Continuity Environmental Impact of Products STEM Talent Pipeline Climate Risks (Physical and Transition) Strengthening Health Systems Board & ELT Members Integrated Risk Management &  Business Continuity Circular Economy STEM Talent Pipeline Climate Risks (Physical and Transition) Strengthening Health Systems Our Strategy 51 Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Q2   The Generics business  grew 8% in FY25. Could  you share insights into  growth drivers for this business  for the coming years? The Generics business contributed 19%  to consolidated Group revenues, with  revenues at  H 30,175 million (~USD 357  million) in FY25 as compared to  H 27,985  million (~USD 338 million) in FY24,  reflecting a growth of 8%. The Generics business saw a stronger  second half in FY25, with growth in  Generic Formulations and a volume-led  recovery in the API base business driving  full-year operational revenue growth. Q4  was particularly strong, marked by six new  launches, including Lenalidomide and  Dasatinib in the U.S. While Lenalidomide  supported full-year performance, a key  strategic milestone was the launch of  our first GLP-1 formulation, Liraglutide,  in the UK. Despite ongoing pricing and  demand pressures in the base portfolio,  cost and operational efficiency programs  helped offset some challenges. Overall,  performance aligned with expectations,  with Generic Formulations contributing  ~40% to product sales, up from ~35% in  FY24. We will maintain our focus on high-barrier,  complex products—such as peptides  (notably GLP-1 agonists), fermentation- based APIs, HPAPIs, and complex  injectables. Advancing our GLP-1 strategy  remains a key growth driver, supported by  regional expansion, strategic partnerships,  capacity scaling, cost efficiency, supply  chain resilience, and accelerated digital  transformation. Q3   What is the financial  outlook for Biocon  Biologics in the near term  and its financial goals for the  future?

We’re also broadening  our global footprint across both advanced  and emerging markets. We continue to invest in long-term  growth, with annual capital expenditure  expected at ~USD 100 million. Phase 2 of  our Malaysia capacity expansion, focused  on scaling Insulin Drug Substance and  Drug Product manufacturing. Routine  maintenance and efficiency upgrades  across our network also form part of this  investment. We remain committed to responsible  financial management, with a clear focus  on strengthening our balance sheet  and supporting long-term growth. We  are prioritizing the timely repayment  of upcoming structured instrument  maturities and strategically reducing debt  across the Biocon Group. These proactive  measures are designed to enhance  financial flexibility and build lasting  investor confidence. Q4   What were the R&D  investments and CapEx  during FY25? What are the  expectations for FY26? Innovation remains central to our business,  supported by strategic R&D investments.  In FY25, the net R&D investment was  H 8,585 million (~USD 102 million), or 7%  of Biocon revenues (excluding Syngene).  This included  H 2,862 million invested in  Generics (USD 34 million, 9% of Generics  revenue) and  H 5,921 million in Biosimilars  (~USD 70 million, 7% of Biosimilars  revenue). For FY26, R&D investments are expected  to be 7–10% of revenues across both  Generics and Biosimilars. In Generics, we’ll  focus on complex, integrated products  like GLP peptides, fermentation APIs,  HPAPIs, and injectables. In Biosimilars, we’ll  continue building a globally competitive  pipeline through sustained innovation. In line with our guidance, we expanded  capacities and enhanced capabilities  across Generics, Biosimilars, and Research  Services to support future growth.  CapEx spending in FY25 totaled  H 23,433  million (~USD 277 million), reinforcing  our readiness to meet evolving market  demands. CapEx for FY26 is expected to be in the  range of USD 200-250 million across the  three business segments reflecting a  balanced approach to scaling capabilities,  modernizing infrastructure, and driving  long-term value creation. In Generics, we plan to invest USD 50–60  million in expanding API capacity— focusing on peptides, HPAPIs, and  non-immunosuppressant fermentation  products. On the formulations side,  we’re in the process of commissioning a  greenfield injectables facility in Bengaluru  and scaling up our oral solid dosage site  in the U.S. In the Biosimilars segment, annual  capital expenditure is projected to be  approximately USD 100 million. This  investment will fund Phase 2 of our  capacity expansion in Malaysia, aimed at  scaling up the manufacturing of Insulin  Drug Substance and Drug Product to meet  rising global demand. It will also support  routine maintenance and efficiency  enhancements across our operations in FY26, we plan to invest around USD  55 million in Syngene. About 40% is  expected to be spent in Research Services  to expanding scientific capabilities  and automation, 35% in biologics  including upgrading our U.S. biologics  facility and 15% in the small molecule  CDMO business. The remainder will  support digitization and productivity  enhancements. Q5   How much debt do we  carry on the Company’s  balance sheet? What is  the roadmap towards debt  reduction? As of March 31, 2025, consolidated debt  on a reported basis stood at  H 177,555  76 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

million (~USD 2.1 billion). Adjusting for  cash balances and optionally convertible  debentures / non-convertible debentures  linked to equity in Biocon Biologics, net  debt would be  H 91,290 million (~USD 1.1  billion). Reducing debt remains a key strategic  priority for the Company. In FY25,  Biocon Biologics advanced its efforts by  successfully issuing its debut USD 800  million bond on the Singapore Stock  Exchange and securing a new USD 320  million syndicated term loan facility.  The combined proceeds were used to  refinance USD 1.1 billion of existing debt  thereby enhancing liquidity, improving  financial flexibility, and supporting  reinvestment in core business operations. In June 2025, following shareholder  approval, Biocon Limited successfully  raised  H 45,000 million through a Qualified  Institutions Placement (QIP). The proceeds  were used to acquire outstanding  optionally convertible debentures of  Biocon Biologics from Goldman Sachs  India AIFs, and will be used to repay or  prepay certain borrowings and financial  instruments and support general  corporate purposes. We continue to examine our business  model and have initiated strategic  initiatives to strengthen manufacturing  productivity and drive cost efficiency  across our business units. We have also  implemented a company-wide cost  optimization drive aimed at reducing the  cost of goods sold (COGS) across products  and facilities. We also remained focused on  optimizing inventory levels and improving  working capital management. Q6   How did the Research  Services segment  perform in FY25? What  are the significant trends  and developments that have  impacted the Company’s  performance in this space? Revenue in the Research Services segment  grew 4% from  H 34,886 million (~USD 421  million) in FY24 to  H 36,424 million (~USD  431 million) in FY25. Overall, it was a  resilient performance in a challenging year.  The business returned to growth in the  second half of the year, after a challenging  first half, driven by a sectoral downturn in  US biotech funding which affected our  Discovery Services division. Growth during the year was led by  large molecule development and  manufacturing services. Discovery services  witnessed weak demand in the first  half but rebounded in the second half,  driven by pilot project conversions and  new client demand. Dedicated centers  delivered a stable performance. We expect the positive momentum from  H2 FY25 to carry into FY26, supported  by stronger pipeline visibility. Industry  fundamentals remain robust, driven by  rising R&D outsourcing and evolving  client supply chains due to geopolitical  shifts. With our integrated model, available  capacity, and continued investment  in capabilities, we are well-positioned  to capture long-term growth in the  expanding CRDMO market. FY26 is expected to be a transitional  year amid short-term macroeconomic  uncertainties, including biotech funding  recovery, Big Pharma restructuring, and  reduced urgency around the Biosecure  Act. Despite these headwinds, our core  business remains strong, with early-teen  revenue growth expected from research  and CDMO segments. However, due to  inventory rebalancing in large molecule  commercial manufacturing, reported  revenue growth is likely to be in the mid- single digits Q7   Highlight some of the key  initiatives and outcomes  undertaken on the ESG  front by the Company. At Biocon, sustainability is a key strategic  priority integrated across our operations.  The ESG approach of the Company is  guided by dedicated ESG and CSR Board  Committees and overseen by the Board,  ensuring alignment with long-term goals  and stakeholder expectations. We made good progress across our ESG  initiatives during FY25 reflected in various  milestone and awards received during the  year, listed below. These achievements  reflect our ongoing commitment to  responsible growth, transparency, and  long-term value creation. As part of Environmental Stewardship, ISO  50001:2018 certification was received for  energy management for two sites in India.  We also recycled and reused 78% of our  water, achieved 89% circularity in resource  utilization, and sourced 73% of our power  from renewable energy sources such as  wind and solar. As part of our Social Responsibility efforts,  we achieved 21% workforce diversity  (women in workforce) in Biocon Limited  as against 17.6% the previous fiscal with a  continued focus on employee wellbeing,  safety, and development. Governance and transparency have been  strengthened with further integration  of ESG risks within our enterprise risk  management framework. For FY25, we  obtained reasonable assurance for our  BRSR (Core) indicators disclosure and  Limited assurance for other non-financial  disclosures in the FY25 Integrated Annual  Report and FY25 BRSR & ESG Data Book. Global recognitions reflect continued  improvement in our ESG performance  with an improved ESG score of 69 (from  63) in 2024 in the 2024 S&P Global CSA,  with Biocon featuring in the S&P Global  Sustainability Yearbook for the third  consecutive year, securing a ranking in  the top 5% of the biotechnology sector.

Third Party Impact Assessment A third-party impact assessment for  eLAJ Smart Clinics has been undertaken  by Indian Institute of Management  Bangalore (IIMB), using a mixed-methods  conceptual framework titled Management  for Holistic Engagement and Action for  Long Term Health (mHealth), adapted  from the WHO health systems framework  that aims to evaluate service efficiency  and establish a long-term monitoring  system. The approach has been adaptive  and moderated according to the Indian  context, and considerate of the scope and  responsibilities of Biocon Foundation. Third Party Impact Assessment Mission Coherence : eLAJ Smart Clinics  serve underserved communities, with  over  65%  of patients below the poverty  line with low education levels - around  11% have studied up to Class VI,  44%  have  studied up to Class VII-X, and  23%  lack  formal education. Access and Affordability : Around  66%   of the patients reside within  1  km of the  eLAJ clinic ensuring easy, walkable access.  91%  of the patients reported receiving  diagnostic services at the clinic and all  of them reported receiving the services  free of charge. This combination of close  proximity and zero cost diagnostics  support higher utilization and affordability  enhancing patient satisfaction. High Quality of Care : eLAJ Smart  Clinics deliver consistent, high-quality  care through SOPs, regular audits, and  strong follow-up- 93.1%  of NCD patients  return monthly. Medication adherence is  high -  87.1%  for hypertension,  93.1%  for  diabetes, and  97.1%  for patients with both  conditions. Robust Partnerships : eLAJ leverages  partnerships with NGOs, medical colleges,  and the Karnataka government. Local  panchayats in Hennagara and Huskur in  Bengaluru support the clinics by providing  space. St. John’s and Oxford Medical  Colleges strengthen clinical services  through staff, specialists, and capacity  building. Proactive Community Outreach : eLAJ  teams conduct door-to-door surveys  and NCD screenings via the Epicollect  app. In FY25,  5,157  individuals were  screened through  58  outreach camps. Key  findings include high tobacco use ( 26% ),  suspected hypertension ( 10.2% ), diabetes  ( 4.3% ), anemia ( 35.3% ), and obesity  ( 12.3% ). ECGs were conducted for  3,400+   individuals. The baseline assessment  has proven to be an effective strategy in  aligning health interventions specific to  the context. High Standard Clinical Performance :  eLAJ’s NCD model shows strong  outcomes, with most patients achieving  blood pressure and glucose control.

Management Discussion  and   Analysis The global economy continues to show resilience, marked by steady growth  and a rapid decline in inflation after its recent surge. Despite challenges  such as post-pandemic supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions— including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and unrest in the Middle East—and  rising energy and food prices, the economy has adapted impressively. This  resilience is supported by favorable supply-side developments, including  easing energy costs and a rebound in labor market participation. Ongoing tariff revisions and geopolitical tensions may temper global GDP  growth, easing the growth rate for advanced economies from 4.3% (2019– 2024) to 3.8% (2024–2029). In contrast, emerging markets and developing  economies are set to accelerate from 5.2% to 5.4%, driven by domestic  demand and broader trade ties. Advanced Economies remain central to the growth trajectory since they  represented 58.5% of the global output in 2024. With a projected 3.8%  growth over the next five years, they are expected to maintain a dominant  share that will continue to exceed 56% through 2029, reinforcing their  enduring influence on global economic dynamics. Nonetheless, the rising importance of emerging markets and developing  economies cannot be overlooked. Marked by rapid industrialization,  urbanization, and demographic shifts, these regions are becoming  substantial contributors to global GDP growth, consumption patterns, and  investment inflows. Forecasts indicate a CAGR of 5.4% between 2024 and  2029, with significant prominence in emerging economies across Asia,  particularly India. 4.7% 4.3% 5.2% 4.5% 3.8% 5.4% 0. 0% 1. 0% 2. 0% 3. 0% 4. 0% 5. 0% 6. 0% Wo rl dA dvanced  eco nomie sE me rging market an d de ve lo pi ng  ec on omie s GDP CAGR,  %       

 CAGR (2019-2024) CAGR (2024-2029F ) Source: World Economic Outlook-April 2025, Frost & Sullivan Note: F - Forecast India’s projected GDP acceleration, from an average of 6.6% during 2019– 2024 to 9.5% during 2024–2029, is underpinned by strong domestic drivers,  including robust private consumption, rising infrastructure investment,  digitalization, and structural policy reforms, as well as external tailwinds  such as the China+1 and ongoing tariff wars. Comparatively lower US tariffs  on Indian goods, relative to Chinese goods, are boosting India’s export  competitiveness, significantly benefiting Indian suppliers. India is projected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2027,  surpassing Japan and Germany, with a GDP forecast to exceed USD 5 trillion.  India aims to achieve developed economy status by 2047, driven by robust  growth projections of 9.5% between 2024 and 2029. This surge in growth  is bolstered by escalating domestic consumer demand across sectors,  substantial government and private global investments, strengthened  global partnerships, and reforms centered on the Atmanirbhar Bharat  initiative and a flourishing Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprise  (MSME) sector. Furthermore, manufacturing has historically contributed 16-17% of the  country’s GDP. With the prioritization of manufacturing across sectors,  including automotive, engineering, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and  consumer durables, through the implementation of policies like the  Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and industrial development  schemes in states with industrial backwardness, the manufacturing sector  is expected to account for 25% of GDP by 2025. As India strengthens its  position in the global manufacturing landscape, the pharmaceutical  industry holds significant potential. By serving both domestic and export  markets, pharmaceutical companies can harness the momentum of India’s  rise as a prominent manufacturing destination. The projected expansion in emerging markets and developing economies,  alongside consistent growth in advanced economies, is expected to  stimulate demand across crucial sectors like healthcare and pharmaceuticals  in particular. Global Pharma Market Overview The global pharmaceutical market is entering a period of strong and  sustained growth, presenting compelling opportunities. Key supply-side  drivers include the launch of innovative therapies and a significant uptick in  generics and biosimilars, especially as major drugs face patent expirations.  On the demand side, demographic shifts such as aging populations and the  rising burden of chronic diseases are fueling long-term healthcare needs.  Additionally, increased prioritization of health, broader access to affordable  treatments, and growing consumer awareness are expanding the market  base. The industry is undergoing a transformation, shaped by scientific innovation,  demographic evolution, and geopolitical  developments . Breakthroughs  in biomedical research and a growing emphasis on curative therapies  are accelerating innovation pipelines. At the same time, the push for  affordability and access is prompting companies to diversify their portfolios,  particularly in generics and biosimilars, which offer attractive margins and  scalability. Traditional growth levers like chronic disease prevalence and OTC consumer  engagement—remain strong, while emerging trends such as precision  medicine and complex biologics are opening new high-value segments.  These shifts are not only reshaping product development but also  redefining competitive strategies and investment priorities. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% between 2024 and 2029,  outpacing the 5.4% CAGR recorded from 2019 to 2024. By 2029, the global  pharmaceutical market is expected to reach USD 1.6 trillion, up from USD  1.18 trillion in 2024. 219 Statutory Reports Management Discussion & Analysis Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Oncology leads with 17.7% market share, projected to rise to  20.2% by 2029, driven by next-gen immunotherapies, targeted biologics,  faster approvals, rising cancer diagnoses, and improved access. Cardiovascular therapies, long slowed by generics, are set to grow at a 9.7%  CAGR, reaching USD 71 billion by 2029, fueled by novel lipid and heart  failure drugs and increased focus on metabolic risk. CNS therapies will expand from USD 94 billion in 2024 to USD 150 billion by  2029, driven by aging populations, neurodegenerative diseases, and mental  health awareness. Obesity is emerging as a high-growth area, with market value growing  at over 30% CAGR, led by GLP-1 drugs and their synergy with diabetes,  cardiovascular, and metabolic care. While GLP-1s reshape diabetes  treatment, insulin remains vital, sustaining growth in metabolic and  endocrine therapies. By 2029, chronic therapies are expected to comprise 75–80% of total  pharma market value, shaped by lifelong medication use, high-value acute  treatments, and specialty therapies with curative potential.

Currently, over 70 biosimilars have  been approved in the U.S. across 21 molecules, and more than 80  biosimilars have been approved in Europe across 24 molecules.   Despite the U.S. being an advanced market, the entry of biosimilars  often coincides with branded biologics becoming more affordable.  Biosimilars adoption has not only reduced healthcare costs but has  also significantly increased access.   Emerging markets are also witnessing rapid adoption of biosimilars,  fueled by the growing demand for affordable healthcare solutions.  As healthcare systems in these regions face the dual challenge of  rising disease prevalence and limited resources, biosimilars provide a  viable solution to reduce the financial burden on both patients and  healthcare systems.   Biosimilars Market: Regulatory and Policy Trends   Policymakers around the world are increasingly recognizing the  potential of biosimilars to address challenges related to healthcare  affordability and access. In many countries, legislative efforts are  focused on promoting biosimilars as a cost-effective alternative to  expensive biologic drugs. By incentivizing biosimilar development  through regulatory frameworks, lawmakers aim to foster competition  and reduce overall healthcare spending.   For example, in the U.S., the FDA’s Biosimilars Action Plan (BAP) seeks to  streamline biosimilar development and approval processes. The BAP  focuses on improving regulatory clarity, enhancing communication  with stakeholders, and supporting biosimilar adoption by addressing  misinformation and deterring anti-competitive behavior.   Similarly, in Europe, lawmakers are encouraging biosimilar adoption  through policies that promote substitution and improve access to  high- quality treatments.   There is also a growing global emphasis on the localization of  pharmaceutical production within regional markets. This shift is driven  by trade policies, regulatory changes, and strategic goals focused on  enhancing supply chain resilience and ensuring consistent access to  essential medicines. As a result, companies are increasingly forming  partnerships with local entities to navigate complex regulatory  environments and improve market penetration.   Moreover, the integration of digital technologies, such as artificial  intelligence (AI) and digital twins, is revolutionizing biosimilar  development. These tools enhance manufacturing precision and  accelerate clinical trial processes, contributing to more efficient and  cost-effective production. Leading biosimilars companies, including  Biocon Biologics, are running AI pilots at various stages of the product  value chain to improve operational efficacy and reduce development  timelines.   There are also discussions about allowing biosimilar manufacturers  to initiate patent litigation at the start of Phase 3 clinical trials in the  U.S. This approach could align biosimilar launch timelines more closely  with those of generic drugs.   Diabetes Portfolio- A Key Differentiator   Diabetes has emerged as one of the most pressing global health  challenges of the 21st century. According to the International Diabetes  Federation’s 2025 Diabetes Atlas, approximately 589 million adults  aged 20–79 are living with diabetes worldwide—equating to about 1  in 9 individuals. The prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled since 1990,  with projections indicating that the number of affected adults could  soar to 853 million by 2050. 229 Statutory Reports Management Discussion & Analysis Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

  At the heart of the fight against diabetes is insulin therapy. Advances in  insulin formulations and delivery methods have significantly improved  the management of the disease, yet there remains a global disparity in  access to these life-saving treatments.   Our insulin portfolio plays a crucial role in our broader mission to  enhance access to critical medicines, especially in regions where  healthcare resources are limited. By expanding the availability of  affordable, high-quality insulin, we aim to bridge this gap and ensure  that all patients, regardless of their location or income- have the  opportunity to manage their diabetes effectively.   In 2024, Biocon Biologics, along with its partners, emerged as the  third- largest supplier by biologic volume of both rh-Insulin and insulin  glargine U100 worldwide.

Research Services (Syngene) - FY25 Highlights:   The Company continued to add capacity and capabilities in Discovery  Services at its Bangalore and Hyderabad campuses in areas such as  antibody-drug conjugates, peptides and oligonucleotides. Within  Research services, Syngene continued to receive pilot projects  from large and medium sized pharma companies and successfully  converted majority of these programs into full-fledged contracts.  Syngene continued technology upgrades and automation in its  operations to enhance scientific excellence.   In small molecule CDMO, a new, dedicated laboratory for the synthesis  of potent molecules has been established. A state-of-the-art facility for  handling molecules under OEB-4 conditions has been set up at the  Mangalore site. The Company has also been focusing on executing  process development projects to build further on follow-the-molecule  approach.   Syngene acquired its first biologics site in the USA – fitted with  multiple monoclonal antibody (mAbs) manufacturing lines. The  state-of-the-art biologics facility, acquired by Syngene USA Inc., a  wholly owned subsidiary of Syngene, from Emergent Manufacturing  Operations Baltimore, LLC (a subsidiary of Emergent BioSolutions Inc.),  will expand Syngene’s growing global biologics footprint to better  serve its customers across both human and animal health market  segments. It enables Syngene to expand its footprint in the largest  US market and comply with requirements of clients looking for USDA  approvals for their products. The new site will increase Syngene’s total  single-use bioreactor capacity to 50,000L for large molecule discovery,  development and manufacturing services.   During the year, the Company introduced a protein production  platform, which reduces development timelines by months for  a variety of biologics. Syngene progressed with repurposing the  biologics manufacturing facility (Unit III) acquired in FY25. The facility  has recently got local regulatory approvals. During the year, Syngene  achieved a milestone by becoming the first company in the Indian  pharma and life sciences industry to earn the 5S certification (5S is a  cyclical methodology: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, sustain the  cycle) for the biologics quality control laboratory. 234 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

  Research Services (Syngene) - FY25 Financial Performance:   Syngene generated operating revenues of  `  36,424 million,  contributing to 23% of Biocon’s overall revenues and reflecting a  growth of 4% over FY24, underpinned by growth in Research Services  and Large Molecule CDMO business partially offset by decline in Small  Molecule CDMO business.   The growth in Research services was led by pipeline build of pilot  programs in discovery services deriving from large- and medium- sized pharma companies as they rebalance their China+1 supply chain  network. Syngene has been successful in converting the majority of  those pilots into full program contracts. Dedicated centers delivered  at sustained pace.   Syngene’s large molecule biologics business has delivered another  strong year performance with FY25 growth of over 20% primarily  driven by the ramp-up in commercial volumes. In the second half of the  year, the company concluded several new collaborations with clients  to execute integrated biologics development and manufacturing  projects across both human and animal health that have the potential  to feed into the pipeline for future commercial manufacturing.   Talking about the revenue breakup, Research Services remained  stable, contributing to 61% of the total revenue, consistent with last  year. Our large molecule CDMO business saw a solid uptick with its  revenue share increasing to 25% in FY25 from 21% in FY24. On the  other hand, small molecule CDMO contributed 12% this year, down  from 16% in the prior year.   The consolidated financial performance of Syngene for FY25 is  available in its Annual Report.   Research Services (Syngene) – FY26 Outlook:   We expect FY26 to be a transient year with uncertain short-term  macro environment including pace of recovery in biotech funding,  big pharma restructuring and tempering of urgency on the Biosecure  Act. However, our underlying business growth remains strong with  revenue growth in the early teens, driven by performance across  research and CDMO businesses.   Adjusted for the need to balance client inventory in the large molecule  commercial manufacturing, our reported revenue growth is likely to  be in the mid-single digits. We have invested in building capabilities  both in India and the acquisition of the biologics facility in the U.S.  to strengthen our leading position in the biologics market. With the  new facilities coming online and the ramp-up over the couple of years,  we expect margins to moderate in the near term. We will continue to  strategically invest in areas that strengthen our position as a leading  integrated provider of research, development and manufacturing  services. We will continue to add new niche capabilities and capacities  that position us an integrated, differentiated and valued service  provider for our clients.

A risk is a  potential event or non-event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of  which can adversely affect the objectives or strategy of the company  or result in opportunities being missed. Risk is measured in terms of  likelihood of occurrence and potential impact if it materializes. Risks  can be categorized as Strategic, Regulatory and Statutory, Sectoral,  Geo-political, Information technology, Catastrophic, Executional/  Operational, and Sustainability (ESG).   By effectively managing the risks that may have a material impact  on the business either financially or otherwise, one can create  sustainable value for all stakeholders. Therefore, identifying, assessing,  and effectively managing key risks that matter is critical to attaining  strategic objectives and to protect the interest of the stakeholders.   Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)  is an integrated approach to  proactively managing risks which affect the achievement of vision,  mission, and objectives. Risk management does not aim at eliminating  the risks, as that would simultaneously eliminate all chances of rewards/  opportunities. Risk Management is instead focused on ensuring  that these risks are known and addressed through a pragmatic and  effective risk management process.   At Biocon Limited  we follow a robust Risk Management framework  that ensures business operations continue uninterrupted. The key  objectives are:   §   Better understand the Company’s risk profile.   §   Increased certainty and fewer surprises.   §   Ensure that the Executive Leadership team can make informed  business decisions based on risk assessment.   §   Sound business opportunities are identified and pursued  without exposing the business to an unacceptable level of risk.   §   Contribute to safeguard Company value and interest of  shareholders.   §   Improve compliance with good corporate governance guidelines  and practices as well as laws and regulations.   Our Risk Management Process:   Once a risk is identified, there are four different ways in which a risk can  be handled – Treat, Terminate, Transfer, Take. At Biocon, a responsive  action plan is initiated for treating or managing the key risks identified  and bringing them to a tolerable level. S t r u c t u r e R o l e s   a n d   R e s p o n s i b i l i t y R i s k   m a n a g e m e n t   a c t i v i t y   c a l e n d a r P r o c e s s R i s k   I d e n t i  c a t i o n   a n d   A s s e s s m e n t R i s k   P r i o r i t i z a t i o n R i s k   M i t i g a t i o n R i s k   M o n i t o r i n g   a n d   R e p o r t i n g   The risk management process at Biocon involves the following four  steps:   1.   Risk Identification and Assessment   2.   Risk Prioritization   3.   Risk Mitigation   4.   Risk Monitoring and Reporting 238 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

  The organization’s risks are identified, assessed, and prioritized on  a periodic basis. The risk monitoring and reporting process aims to  provide assurance to the Management that risks have been adequately  identified, assessed, prioritized based on its impact on business and  the likelihood of occurrence, and mitigation strategies put in place  and regularly monitored for their effectiveness. The Risk Management  Committee reviews the key risks that matter with respect to their gross  exposure, mitigation action status, and net exposure periodically.   Our Risk Management Structure:   Biocon Limited’s Board of Directors has direct oversight of the  Company’s overall risk management framework. The Board has  formed a Risk Management Committee which reviews key existing  and emerging risks, monitors the adequacy of mitigation strategies  as well as the progress on implementing such strategies. The Risk  Management Committee, which comprises of the Chairperson,  Independent Directors and Managing Director and CEO meet once  every quarter, and invites senior business leaders, who are essential to  the discussions, to these meetings.

The three lines of defense model lays out clear  risk management responsibilities and accountabilities to ensure a  company´s risk-related objectives are achieved. In this model, the  first line i.e., Departments/ Functions (risk owners, risk managers and  business unit heads) are responsible for executing and implementing  the risk management initiatives set and assigned by the second line;  the second line i.e., the Risk Management Committee and Executive  Leadership Team with the support of Chief Risk Officer establishes  the framework sets approach, provides direction and monitors  risk management activities. The third line, i.e., the internal audit/  Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) team or an external auditor,  provides independent assurance that organizational practices are  aligned with the company’s risk strategy and policies, as implemented  by the first and second lines.   Collaboration:  With time, the practice of risk management has shifted  in a fundamental way. In the past, risks were managed in “silos”. Over  time, risk management framework recognized that risks, by their  nature, are highly interconnected and interdependent. This evolved  approach views all risks together, within a coordinated and strategic  framework, which is integrated throughout the organization cutting  across functions. To formalize and communicate its approach to risk  management, the Company has put in place an enterprise-wide  Risk Management Framework. This holistic approach provides the  assurance that, to the best of its capabilities, the Company and all its  business units identify, assess, and mitigate risks that could materially  impact on its performance in achieving the stated objectives. Our  Chief Risk Officer works closely with all key functional heads who are  the Risk and Mitigation plan owners.   Our integrated approach to risk management encompasses both  business risks and ESG-related risks. This comprehensive view  acknowledges the interconnected nature of risks across the Company,  its stakeholders. and the value chain.   Our risk universe covers the entire gamut of risk exposure categorized  under Sectoral, Strategic, Information Technology, Catastrophic,  ESG/ Sustainability, Geo-political, Regulatory and Statutory, and  Executional/ Operational risks. From this risk library the key risks that  matter are arrived at based on the high impact on business and the  high likelihood of occurrence. For the key risks that matter, mitigation  strategies are developed, implemented, and assessed on a periodic  basis.   Risk Culture:  To strengthen the risk culture across the Organization,  we undertake awareness programs with relevant stakeholders to  educate them on the significance of risk management and encourage  a culture of constant feedback to drive continuous improvement in  our risk management systems and processes.   Key Business Risks and Opportunities:   Our established risk management framework addresses risks that are  inherent to the pharma business and any others that may impact on  our strategic goals. The following summary indicates some of our key  risks and mitigation measures drawn from management reviews and  deliberations with the Risk Management Committee: 239 Statutory Reports Management Discussion & Analysis Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

A keen eye to identify and understand  Significant Emerging Risks  and Opportunities  is also placed from time to time. This enables  the company to manage these risks and safeguard our business  proactively.   Currently the Generics industry faces two opposing forces that  complicate profitability and growth. While demand for generics  continues to increase globally and there will be an increase in number  of blockbusters and other small molecule drugs going off-patent  globally in next 5 years, buyers consolidation/ consortia may further  add to the existing price pressure and limit generics manufacturers  pricing power, reduce profitability and force to exit markets.   Geopolitical risks include the collapse of a multilateral institution,  interstate conflicts, global trade wars and tariffs, terrorist attacks, etc.  Any occurrence of this nature has the potential to severely disrupt our  operations along with irreparable damage to life, access to medicines,  livelihood and the ecosystem. Consistent monitoring of the regional  policies and statutes in different countries where our products are  marketed and sold is undertaken to ensure compliance.   An early alert to such risk events and scenarios provides us with the  ability to plan, prepare for and respond against adverse impact and  based on the assessment, it will be taken either as a placeholder in  our risk library or if rated high, included in the key risks that matter for  mitigation and monitoring.   AI and ML-driven drug discovery startups are transforming the  traditional generics industry by speeding up the discovery process  and bringing innovative medications and therapies to market. While  these technologies can expedite R&D, improve productivity and lower  costs, they pose risks in terms of data governance, bias, and IP disputes.   The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2023 identifies  misinformation as the fifth most severe long term global risk. As  the internet continues to evolve, pharmaceutical companies face  increasing vulnerability to misinformation campaigns that can  disseminate unreliable information about their products, ultimately  undermining public trust in both the brand and the industry as a  whole.   Our way forward plan is to further embed these risk management  practices into the wider organization, by taking measures to educate  and incentivize employees at all levels of the business, thereby  nurturing a strong and effective risk culture. Creating a strong risk  culture is important for integrating risk processes, procedures, and  employee awareness throughout the organization. Such an approach  ensures risk management is not just a compliance exercise but a  fundamental part of the company’s operational mindset.   Internal Controls   The Company has laid down guidelines, processes, and structures,  which enable implementation of appropriate internal control systems  commensurate with the business requirements, scale of operations  and applicable statutes. Such internal financial controls encompass  policies, processes and key activities or procedures adopted by the  Company for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of business,  245 Statutory Reports Management Discussion & Analysis Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

including adherence to its policies, safeguarding of its assets,  prevention and detection of fraud and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of accounting records and the timely preparation of  reliable financial information. These include controls in the nature of  manual or automated (IT applications including the ERP applications  wherein the transactions are approved and recorded).   The Company is staffed by experienced, qualified professionals who  play an important role in designing, implementing, maintaining, and  monitoring our internal control systems. Appropriate review and self- certification mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that such  control systems are adequate and are operating effectively on an  ongoing basis.   The Corporate Internal Audit team is an independent assurance  and advisory function, responsible for evaluating and improving the  effectiveness of controls, risk management practices and governance  processes. This function helps to enhance and protect organizational  value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice and insights.   The internal audit team prepares annual audit plans based on risk  assessment, which are approved by the Audit Committee of the  Board. Audit execution is done in a co-sourcing model, partly in- house and partly by an Audit Firm. Such independent audits provide  reasonable assurance of internal control effectiveness and benchmark  on industry-wide best practices.   The firm representative and the Head of Internal Audit present an  update on a quarterly basis on their respective areas of scope to the  Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, consisting of Independent  Directors, reviews important issues raised by the auditors regularly,  alongside the remediation actions to ensure the control environment  stays strong and risks are mitigated appropriately on a timely basis. 246 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited

A.    Board Membership Criteria and Selection Process   The responsibility for identifying and evaluating a candidate for the  Board is discharged by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee  (‘NRC’) as mandated under Section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013 read  with Regulation 19 of SEBI Listing Regulations. During the candidate  selection process, the NRC meticulously assesses the composition and  diversity of the Board/Committee to ensure it possesses the requisite  blend of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge to sustain  effectiveness. Diversity, from the NRC’s perspective, encompasses a  broad spectrum of factors including but not limited to perspective,  experience, education, background, ethnicity, nationality, age, gender,  and other personal attributes. These attributes extend to encompass  professional experience, functional expertise, as well as educational  and professional backgrounds.   Annually, the Independent Directors furnish a Certificate of  Independence in accordance with relevant laws, which is duly  taken on record by the Board. Encouraging collaboration and  communication, all Board Members are urged to engage and interact  with management. Furthermore, Board Members are actively invited  to pivotal meetings to contribute strategic insights and guidance. The  NRC  selects   suitable  candidates   based  on  defined   attributes  and   expertise.   After thorough  screening, the NRC  recommends desired  candidates to the  Board. The Board  recommends the  appointment of  the Director to the  shareholders.  The proposal is  placed before the  shareholders for  their approval.  B.   Board Procedure   The Board and Committee meetings are meticulously planned, with  schedules tailored to accommodate the availability of Directors.  An annual calendar of these meetings is circulated well in advance,  facilitating Directors’ effective scheduling and ensuring their active  participation. Despite this structured approach, urgent matters, within  regulatory constraints, prompt the Board to seek approval through  resolutions by circulation.   The Board meets at least once in a quarter to review and approve  the quarterly financial results/statements alongside addressing other  pertinent agenda items. Typically, Committee meetings precede  those of the Board on the same day, streamlining discussions and  enhancing synergy. The recommendations stemming from Committees  deliberations are duly presented and are placed before the Board for  necessary approval/noting. During the year under review, there was no  situation/matter where the Board has not accepted recommendation of  the Committee.   With a view to leverage technology, the Company has adopted a  digital meeting(s) platform for its Board and Committee meetings,  which can be accessed through web version, iOS and Android based  application. The Board/ Committee Agenda and related notes are  made available to the Directors, at least 7 (seven) days in advance of  the meetings through this application, which meets high standards of  security and integrity that is required for storage and transmission of  Board/ Committee related documents in electronic form. All material  information is incorporated in the agenda along with supporting  documents and relevant presentations.

Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of Biocon Limited Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements Opinion We have audited the standalone financial statements of  Biocon Limited   (the “Company”), its Employee Welfare Trusts ("Trust") which comprise  the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the standalone  statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income),  standalone statement of changes in equity and standalone statement of  cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial  statements, including material accounting policies and other explanatory  information (herein referred to as the "standalone financial statements"). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the  explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give  the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner  so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company  as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and other comprehensive income,  changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with  the  Standards  on  Auditing    (SAs)  specified  under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under  those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the  Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are  independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical  requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial  statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and  we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence  we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were  of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements  of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our  audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming  our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these  matters. Impairment assessment of long term investments in subsidiaries See Note 6 and 2(a) to standalone financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company has long term investments in subsidiaries aggregating to  Rs.  113,496 million as at 31 March 2025. The Company accounts for these  investments at cost less any provision for impairment loss. Changes in the  business environment, including market or economic environment and  general inflationary trend could have significant impact on the valuation of  these investments. Investments where an indication based on these factors  exist, are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period. The Company determines the recoverable value of such investments and  compares it to the carrying value if there are indicators of impairment. The  recoverable value is the higher of the market value or the Value in Use (VIU).  The recoverable value is determined using the following assumptions: •   projected future cash inflows •   expected growth rate, discount rate, terminal growth rate •   comparison of price and market multiples The assessment of discount rate and terminal growth rate requires  specialized skills and knowledge. Changes in these assumptions, could  impact the recoverable value of the investments Further, these significant  assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic  and market conditions. The impairment testing is significant to our audit,  because of the materiality of the investments  as   well   as   the   involvement  of  estimates and judgements. Our audit procedures to obtain sufficient audit evidence included: •   Assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness  of the relevant key controls in respect of company’s e impairment  assessment process, including approval of forecasts and valuation  models; •   Performed a retrospective analysis to assess the reasonableness of  Company’s projections by comparing historical forecast to actual  results; •   Evaluated the reasonableness of the overall impairment model  including assumptions by involving valuation specialist and comparing  these inputs with externally available data, consistency with Board  approved forecasts and knowledge of the industry and verified overall  mathematical accuracy of calculations; •   Performed sensitivity analysis of key assumptions. These include future  revenue growth rates, terminal growth rate and discount rate applied  in the valuation. 269 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Independent Auditor’s Report (continued...) Going concern See Note 1.2 to standalone financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit In respect of agreements entered into by the Company with certain financial  investors for acquisition of biosimilar business by its subsidiary, there are  put option obligations on the Company to provide exit to the investors.  The Company also has certain long-term borrowings that carry drag along  rights which require the Company to repay the debts if the put options,  as mentioned above, are triggered. As at 31 March 2025, these contractual  agreements indicate possible obligations as described in note 34(ii) to the  financial statements. Management assessed its financial position as at 31 March 2025, its forecasts  for the period of fifteen months from the date of these financial statements,  its ability to re-negotiate the exit terms with investors, ability to raise funds  by issuance of further shares as stated in note 46(b) to the standalone  financial statements and support liquidity from its non-current assets. These factors involve subjectivity considering the fact that some of these  are driven by external environment and hence outcomes could be different  from those factored by the Company. Considering the significance of this  issue  it is considered as a Key Audit Matter. Our audit procedures to assess the going concern assumption included the  following: •   Obtained the forecasted cashflows prepared by the Management for  the next 15 months and examined the basis and details supporting  the estimations considered therein; •   Evaluated the reasonability of the cash flow forecast including  assumptions by comparing these inputs with available data,  consistency with Board approved forecasts and knowledge of the  industry and verified overall mathematical accuracy of calculations; •   Performed sensitivity analysis on the forecasted cash flows by  considering plausible changes to the key assumptions; •   Discussed with Audit Committee and key senior management  personnel regarding the Company’s plan to meet the obligations; •   Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures – refer note 1.2 to the  financial statements. Taxation See Note 2(m), 33 and 34 to standalone financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company’s tax provision involves complexities & judgements with  respect to various tax positions including the following: -   deductibility of transactions -   availability of tax incentives and exemptions for earlier years, , -     Uncertainty in a tax position that may arise as tax laws are subject to  interpretation. Judgment is required in assessing the range of possible outcomes for some  of these tax matters. These judgments could change over time as each of  the matters progresses depending on experience on actual assessment  proceedings by tax authorities and other judicial precedents. The Company makes an assessment (including obtaining opinion from  external legal experts) to determine the outcome of these uncertain tax  positions and decides to make an accrual or consider it to be a possible  contingent liability. Where the amount of tax liabilities are uncertain, the  Company recognizes accruals which reflect its best estimate of the outcome  based on the facts known. Accordingly, this was an area of focus for the  engagement team during the audit for the year ended 31 March 2025. Our audit procedures in relation to Taxation include the following: •   We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s  controls around the tax computation and tax matters; •   We obtained an understanding of the key uncertain tax positions  based on list of ongoing litigations and tax computations for the  current year; •   We reviewed the tax demand / assessment orders and anlaysed the  implications  of  observation   ns in those orders to identify any  additional uncertain tax positions; •   We analysed the Company’s judgment regarding the eventual  resolution of matters with various tax authorities. In this regard, we  understood how the Company has considered past experience, where  available, with the tax authorities in the respective jurisdictions; •   We also reviewed external legal opinions and consultations made by  the Company for key tax matters during current and past periods; and •   We involved tax specialists to assist us in evaluating the technical merits  of tax position to form a judgement and the key assumptions made by  the Company in tax computations and assessing the adequacy of the  Company’s disclosures in respect of contingent liabilities and provision  for tax matters.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial  statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We  also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform  audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The  risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is  higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also  responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company  has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made  by the Management and Board of Directors. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of  Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation  of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty  exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are  based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company  to cease to continue as a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and  whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying  transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the  audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we  have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence,  and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may  Independent Auditor’s Report (continued...) 271 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,  related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we  determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the  standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the  key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless  law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in  extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be  communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits  of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report  on the standalone financial statements of Biocon Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025 Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i)  of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act (Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) Opinion We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements of Biocon Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in  conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the  Company for the year ended on that date. In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal  financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on  the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria  established by such companies/the Company considering the essential  components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”). Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for  Internal Financial Controls The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible  for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria  established by the Company considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include  the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient  conduct of its business, including adherence tothe company’s policies, the  safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors,  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the  Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the  extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements were established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about  the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an  understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing  and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial Statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use,  or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material misstatements due  to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any  evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with  the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The  Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in  India and has its registered office in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. The  Company’s shares are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and  the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India. 1.2   Basis of preparation of financial statements   a)   Statement of compliance     The standalone financial statements have been prepared in  accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as per  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,  as amended from time to time notified under Section 133 of  Companies Act, 2013, (the ‘Act’) and other relevant provisions of  the Act.     These standalone financial statements have been prepared for  the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS  that are effective at the Company’s annual reporting date, March  31, 2025. These standalone financial statements were authorised  for issuance by the Company’s Board of Directors on May 08,  2025.     The Company has a net current asset position of Rs. 4,330 million   including cash and bank balance of Rs. 2,498 as at March 31, 2025.  The Company and one of its subsidiary, Biocon Biologics Limited  had entered into agreements with certain financial investors  which included a put option obligation on the Company to  provide exit to the investors. These contractual put options  indicate possible obligations as described in note 34(ii) and  note 15(b) to the financial statements. Management assessed its  financial position as at March 31, 2025, its forecasts for the period  of fifteen months from the date of these financial statements,  its ability to re-negotiate the exit terms with investors, ability to  raise funds as stated in Note 46 (b) and support liquidity from its  non-current assets. Basis such evaluation, management believes  that the Company has sufficient financial resources available  to it at the date of approval of these financial statements and  has prepared its financial statements under going concern  assumption.     Details of the Company’s material accounting policies are  included in Note 2.   b)   Functional and presentation currency     These standalone financial statements are presented in Indian  rupees (INR), which is also the functional currency of the  Company. All amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest  million, unless otherwise indicated.   c)   Basis of measurement     These standalone financial statements have been prepared  on the historical cost basis (i.e on accrual basis), except for the  following items:    Cert ain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative  instruments) are measured at fair value; and      Net defined benefit assets/(liability) are measured at fair  value of plan a ssets, less present value of defined benefit  obligations.   d)   Use of estimates and judgements     The preparation of the standalone financial statements in  conformity with Ind AS requires Management to make estimates,  judgements and assumptions. These estimates, judgements and  assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  during the period. Accounting estimates could change from  period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Appropriate changes in estimates are made as management  becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the  estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial  statements in the period in which changes are made and, if  material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the standalone  financial statements.    Judgements     Information about judgements made in applying accounting  policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts  recognised in the financial statements is included in the following  notes:     •   Note 2(a) and 36    — Financial instruments;     •   Note 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d)   — Useful lives of property, plant  and equipment, intangible assets and                                   investment property;     •   Note  2(p)  and  38    — Lease, whether an agreement  contains a lease;     •   Note  2(m)  and  33    — Provision for income taxes and  related tax contingencies and evaluation of recoverability  of deferred tax assets.     •   Note  2(k)  and  21    — Revenue Recognition: whether  revenue from sale of product and licensing income is  recognised over time or at a point in time; 1.3   Assumptions and estimation uncertainties   Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that  have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment in the year  ended March 31, 2024 is included in the following notes:   —   Note 2(h)(ii) – impairment test of non-financial assets; key  assumptions underlying recoverable amounts including the  recoverability of expenditure on internally-generated intangible  assets;   —   Note 18 and 33 – recognition of deferred tax assets; uncertain tax  treatment; 285 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025   —   Note 36 – impairment of financial assets: underlaying recoverable  amount   —   Note 17 and 34 – recognition and measurement of provisions  and contingencies: key assumptions about the likelihood and  magnitude of an outflow of resources. 1.4   Measurement of fair values   A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures  require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non- financial assets and liabilities.   Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy  based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:   —   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities.   —   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1  that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as  prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).   —   Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs).   The Company has an established control framework with respect  to the measurement of fair values. This includes a finance team  that has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value  measurements, including Level 3 fair values.   The Company regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and  valuation adjustments. If third party information is used to measure fair  values, then the finance team assesses the evidence obtained from the  third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the  requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in  which the valuations should be classified   When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company  uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to  measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of  the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised  in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest  level input that is significant to the entire measurement.   The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value  hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change  has occurred.   Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair  values is included in the following notes:   —   Note 30      – share based payment arrangements;   —   Note 4 (a)    – investment property; and   —   Note 2(a) and 36    – financial instruments. 2   Material accounting policies a.   Financial instruments   i.   Recognition and initial measurement     Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially  recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets  and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Company  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.     A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair  value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss  (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its  acquisition or issue.   ii.   Classification and subsequent measurement    Financial  assets     On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at    —   amortised  cost;     —   Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) –  equity investment; or     —   Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)     Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial  recognition, except if and in the period the Company changes its  business model for managing financial assets.     A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of  the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:     —   the asset is held within a business model whose objective is  to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and     —   the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.     A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the  following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:     —   the asset is held within a business model whose objective  is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and  selling financial assets; and     —   the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.     On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held  for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present  subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI  (designated as FVOCI – equity investment). This election is made  on an investment -  by -  investment basis. 286 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025     All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or  FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes  all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company  may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets  the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI  as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an  accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.    Equity  investments     All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured  at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading  and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a  business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies are classified  as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may  make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive  income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company  makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The  classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.  If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at  FVOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding  dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of  the amounts from OCI to the Statement of Profit and Loss, even  on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the  cumulative gain or loss to retained earnings. Equity instruments  included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value  with all changes recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     Investments in subsidiaries     Equity investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less  accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication  of impairment exists,the carrying amount of the investment  is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable  amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, the difference  between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial assets at  FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at  fair value. Net gains and losses, including  any interest or dividend income, are  recognised in statement of profit and  loss. However, see Note 36 for derivatives  designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets at  amortised cost These assets are subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest  method. The amortised cost is reduced by  impairment losses. Interest income, foreign  exchange gains and losses and impairment  are recognised in statement of profit and  loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is  recognised in statement of profit and loss. Equity  investments at  FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured  at fair value. Dividends are recognised as  income in statement of profit and loss  unless the dividend clearly represents  a recovery of part of the cost of the  investment. Other net gains and losses are  recognised in OCI and are not reclassified  to statement of profit and loss.     Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or  FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified  as held -  for -  trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such  on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured  at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest  expense, are recognised in statement of profit and loss. Other  financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign  exchange gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit  and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in  statement of profit and loss.   iii.   Derecognition    Financial  assets     The Company derecognises a financial asset when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset  expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash  flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and  rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in  which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all  of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control  of the financial asset.     When the Company has transferred its rights to receive  cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through  arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the  risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred  nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset,  nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to  recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s  continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also  recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the  associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights  and obligations that the Company has retained.    Financial  liabilities     The Company derecognises a financial liability when its  contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.     The Company also derecognises a financial liability when its  terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms  are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability  based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The  difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability  extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms  is recognised in statement of profit and loss. 287 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025   iv.   Offsetting     Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net  amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when,  the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off  the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or  to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.   v.   Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting     The Company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge  its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded  derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted  for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and  certain criteria are met.     Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to  initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and  changes therein are generally recognised in statement of profit  and loss.     The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging  instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated  with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes  in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.     At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Company  documents the risk management objective and strategy for  undertaking the hedge. The Company also documents the  economic relationship between the hedged item and the  hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash  flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected  to offset each other.   vi.   Cash flow hedges     When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging  instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of  the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in other  equity under ‘effective portion of cash flow hedges’. The effective  portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is  recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair  value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis,  from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes  in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in  statement of profit and loss.     If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting  or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is  exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.  When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued,  the amount that has been accumulated in other equity remains  there until, for a hedge of a transaction resulting in recognition  of a non - financial item, it is included in the non - financial item’s  cost on its initial recognition or, for other cash flow hedges, it is  reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the  hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.     If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur,  then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity  are immediately reclassified to statement of profit and loss.   vii.   Treasury shares     The Company has created an Employee Welfare Trust (EWT) for  providing share-based payment to its employees. Own equity  instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised  at cost and deducted from equity. When the treasury shares  are issued to the employees by EWT, the amount received is  recognised as an increase in equity and the resultant gain / (loss)  is transferred to / from securities premium.   viii.   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise  cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an  original maturity of three months or less, which are subject  to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of  the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist  of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of  outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral  part of the Company’s cash management.     Cash dividend to equity holders     The Company recognises a liability to make cash to equity holders  when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no  longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate  laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by  the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly  in equity. Interim dividends are recorded as a liability on the date  of declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors. b.    Property, plant and equipment   i.   Recognition and measurement     Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less  accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,  if any. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment  comprises its purchase price including import duty and non  refundable taxes or levies , any other costs directly attributable  to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use,  and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and  restoring the site on which it is located.     Expenditure incurred on startup and commissioning of the  project and/or substantial expansion, including the expenditure  incurred on trial runs (net of trial run receipts, if any) up to  the date of commencement of commercial production are  capitalised.If significant parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted  for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and  equipment.     Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and  equipment is recognised in statement of profit and loss. 288 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025     Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the  Company and cost can be measured reliably.     Advances paid towards acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date, are shown under other non-current  assets and cost of assets not ready for intended use before the year end, are shown as capital work-in-progress.   ii.   Depreciation     Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives  using the straight-line method. Freehold land is not depreciated.     The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment for the current and comparative periods are as follows: Asset Assets Classification Management estimate of  useful life Useful life as per  Schedule II Building Building 25-30 years 30 years Roads Building 5 years 5 years Plant and equipment (including Electrical  installation and Lab equipment ) Plant and Machinery 9-14 years 8-20 years Computers and servers Plant and Machinery 3 years 3-6 years Office equipment Plant and Machinery 5 years 5 years Research and development equipment Research and development  equipment 9 years 5-10 years Furniture and fixtures Furniture and fixtures 6 years 10 years Vehicles Vehicles 6 years 6-10 years Leasehold improvements Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease period  whichever is lower Leasehold land Land 90 years or lease period  whichever is lower     Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are  reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.  Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the  management believes that its estimates of useful lives as given  above best represent the period over which management  expects to use these assets.     Depreciation on additions (disposals) is provided on a pro-rata  basis i.e. from (upto) the date on which asset is ready for use  (disposed of).   iii.   Reclassification to investment property     When the use of a property changes from owner-occupied to  investment property, the property is reclassified as investment  property at its carrying amount on the date of reclassification. c.   Intangible assets   Internally generated: Research and development   Expenditure on research activities is recognised in statement of profit  and loss as incurred.   Development expenditure is capitalised as part of the cost of the  resulting intangible asset only if the expenditure can be measured  reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible,  future economic benefits are probable, and the Company intends to  and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or  sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognised in statement of profit and loss  as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is measured at  cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment  losses.   Others   Other intangible assets are initially measured at cost. Subsequently,  such intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated  amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. i.   Subsequent expenditure   Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the  future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it  relates, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All other  expenditure, including expenditure on brands, is recognised in  statement of profit and loss as incurred. ii.   Amortisation   Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over the  estimated useful life as follows:   —   Computer  software         3-5  years   —   Marketing and Manufacturing rights     5-10 years   —   Customer related intangibles       5 years   —   Intellectual property rights       5-10 years 289 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025   Amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at  the end of each financial year and adjusted if appropriate. d.   Investment property   Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or  for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary  course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or  services or for administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition,  an investment property is measured at cost. Subsequent to initial  recognition, investment property is measured at cost less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.   Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the  management believes a period of 25 years as representing the best  estimate of the period over which investment properties (which are  quite similar) are expected to be used. Accordingly, the Company  depreciates investment properties over a period of 25 years on a  straight-line basis. The useful life estimate of 25 years is different from  the indicative useful life of relevant type of buildings mentioned in Part  C of Schedule II to the Act i.e. 30 years. Any gain or loss on disposal of  an investment property is recognised in statement of profit and loss. e.   Business combination   In accordance with Ind AS 103, Business combinations, the Company  accounts for business combinations after acquisition date using the  acquisition method when control is transferred to the Company. The  cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given,  equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the  date of exchange. The cost of acquisition also includes the fair value of  any contingent consideration and deferred consideration, if any. Any  goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a  bargain purchase is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as  capital reserve if there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons  for classifying the business combination as resulting in a bargain  purchase; otherwise the gain is recognised directly in equity as capital  reserve. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.   Business combinations between entities under common control is  accounted for at carrying value. f.   Inventories   Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out formula, and  includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production  or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to  their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured  inventories and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share  of fixed production overheads based on normal operating capacity.   Provisions are made towards slow-moving and obsolete items based  on historical experience of utilisation on a product category basis,  which consideration of product lines and market conditions.   Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary  course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling  expenses. The net realisable value of work-in-progress is determined  with reference to the selling prices of related finished products.   Raw materials, components and other supplies held for use in the  production of finished products are not written down below cost  except in cases where material prices have declined and it is estimated  that the cost of the finished products will exceed their net realisable  value.   The comparison of cost and net realisable value is made on an item- by-item basis. g.   Foreign currency Transactions and translations:   Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional  currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.  Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of  such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and  liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at balance sheet date  exchange rates are generally recognised in Statement of Profit and  Loss.   Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign  currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when  the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and  liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain  or loss. For example translation differences on non-monetary assets  such as equity investments classified as FVOCI are recognised in other  comprehensive income (OCI). h.   Impairment   i.   Impairment of financial assets     In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected  credit loss (“ECL”) model for measurement and recognition of  impairment loss on following:     —   financial assets measured at amortised cost; and       Loss allowance for trade receivables with no significant  financing component is measured at an amount equal to  lifetime expected credit losses. For all other financial assets,  ECL are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL,  unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk  from initial recognition in which case those are measured  at lifetime ECL.       Loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised  cost are deducted from gross carrying amount of the assets.  The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust  the loss allowance at the reporting date is recognised as an  impairment gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   ii.   Impairment of non-financial assets     The Company assess at each reporting date whether there is any  indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If  any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount  is estimated and an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying  amount of an asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) exceeds its  290 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 estimated recoverable amount in the statement of profit and  loss.     The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is  higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value  in use is based on the estimated future cash flow, discounted  to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessment of the time value of money and the  risks specific to CGU (or the asset).     The Company’s non-financial assets, are reviewed at each  reporting date to determine whether there is any indication  of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s  recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment testing, assets  that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped  together into cash-generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents  the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are  largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.     Impairment loss recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated first  to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the  CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other  assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.     An impairment loss in respect of other assets for which  impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, the  Company reviews at each reporting date whether there is any  indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An  impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the  estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Such  a reversal is made only to the extent that the asset’s carrying  amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have  been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no  impairment loss had been recognised. i.   Employee benefits   i.   Short-term employee benefits:     All employee benefits falling due within twelve months from  the end of the period in which the employees render the related  services are classified as short-term employee benefits, which  include benefits like salaries, wages, short term compensated  absences, performance incentives, etc. and are recognised as  expenses in the period in which the employee renders the  related service and measured accordingly.”   ii.   Post-employment benefits:     Post-employment benefit plans are classified into defined  benefits plans and defined contribution plans as under:”    Gratuity     The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (“the  Gratuity Plan”) covering the eligible employees of the Company.  The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested  employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of  employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s  salary and the tenure of the employment with the Company.     Liability with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by  actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at  each balance sheet date using the projected unit credit method.  The defined benefit plan is administered by a trust formed for this  purpose through the Company gratuity scheme.     The Company recognises the net obligation of a defined benefit  plan as a liability in its balance sheet. Gains or losses through re- measurement of the net defined benefit liability are recognised  in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to  profit and loss in the subsequent periods. The actual return of  the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by  applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit  obligation is recognised in other comprehensive income. The  effect of any plan amendments are recognised in the statement  of profit and loss.    Provident  Fund     Eligible employees of the Company receive benefits from  provident fund, which is a defined contribution plan. Both  the eligible employees and the Company make monthly  contributions to the Government administered provident  fund scheme equal to a specified percentage of the eligible  employee’s salary. Amounts collected under the provident fund  plan are deposited with in a government administered provident  fund. The Company has no further obligation to the plan beyond  its monthly contributions. Company’s contribution to the  provident fund is charged to Statement of Profit and Loss.   iii.   Compensated absences:     The Company has a policy on compensated absences which  are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The  expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is  determined by actuarial valuation performed by an independent  actuary at each balance sheet date using the projected unit credit  method on the additional amount expected to be paid/availed  as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the  balance sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated  absences is recognised is the period in which the absences occur.     The liability in respect of all defined benefit plans and other long  term benefits is accrued in the books of account on the basis  of actuarial valuation carried out by an independent actuary  using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The obligation is  measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows.  The discount rates used for determining the present value of  obligation under defined benefit plans, is based on the market  yields on Government securities as at the Balance Sheet date,  having maturity periods approximating to the terms of related  obligations.     Remeasurement gains and losses on other long term benefits  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in  which they arise. Remeasurement gains and losses in respect of  all defined benefit plans arising from experience adjustments and  changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period  291 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income.  They are included in other equity in the Statement of Changes in  Equity and in the Balance Sheet. Changes in the present value of  the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments  or curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as  past service cost. Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement  of any defined benefit plan are recognised when the curtailment  or settlement occurs. Any differential between the plan assets  (for a funded defined benefit plan) and the defined benefit  obligation as per actuarial valuation is recognised as a liability if it  is a deficit or as an asset if it is a surplus (to the extent of the lower  of present value of any economic benefits available in the form of  refunds from the plan or reduction in future contribution to the  plan).     Past service cost is recognised as an expense in the Statement  of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the average period  until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits  are already vested immediately following the introduction  of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan, the past service cost  is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  Past service cost may be either positive (where benefits are  introduced or improved) or negative (where existing benefits are  reduced).   iv.   Share-based compensation     The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based payment  awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee  expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the  period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to  the awards. The amount recognised as expense is based on the  estimate of the number of awards for which the related service  and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such  that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on  the number of awards that do meet the related service and non- market vesting conditions at the vesting date.     The grant date fair value of options granted (net of estimated  forfeiture) to employees of the Company is recognised as an  employee expense.     The Company has adopted the policy to account for Employees  Welfare Trust as a legal entity separate from the Company but as  a subsidiary of the Company. Any loan from the Company to the  trust is accounted for as a loan in accordance with its term.     The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of  the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple      awards.  The increase in equity recognised in connection with share based  payment transaction is presented as a   separate component  in equity under “share based payment reserve”. The amount  recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual  number of stock options that vest. For the option awards, grant  date fair value is determined under the option-pricing model  (Black-Scholes-Merton). Forfeitures are estimated at the time of  grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual  forfeitures materially differ from those estimates. j.   Provisions (other than for employee benefits)   A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible  obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not,  require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation  or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of  resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.   A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company  has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated  reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will  be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by  discounting the expected future cash flows (representing the best  estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation  at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the  liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.  Expected future operating losses are not provided for.   Onerous contracts   A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic  benefits to be derived by the Company from the contract are lower  than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the  contract. The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the  present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the  contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before such a provision is made, the Company recognises any  impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. k.   Revenue from contracts with customers   i.   Sale of goods     Revenue is recognised when a promise in a customer contract  (performance obligation) has been satisfied by transferring  control over the promised goods to the customer. Control over  a promised goods refers to the ability to direct the use of, and  obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, those  goods. Control is usually transferred upon shipment, delivery  to, upon receipt of goods by the customer, in accordance with  the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customers.  However, in certain cases, revenue is recognized on sale of  products where shipment is on hold at specific request of the  customer provided performance obligation conditions has been  satisfied and control is transferred, with customer taking title of  the goods. The amount of revenue to be recognised (transaction  price) is based on the consideration expected to be received  in exchange for goods, excluding amounts collected on behalf  of third parties such as goods and services tax or other taxes  directly linked to sales. If a contract contains more than one  performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to  each performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone  selling prices. Revenue from product sales are recorded net of  allowances for estimated rebates, cash discounts and estimates  of product returns, all of which are established at the time of sale.     For contracts with distributors, no sales are recognised when  goods are physically transferred to the distributor under a  292 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 consignment arrangement, or if the distributor acts as an agent.  In such cases, sales are recognised when control over the goods  transfers to the end-customer, and distributor’s commissions are  presented within marketing and distribution.     The consideration received by the Company in exchange for  its goods may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is  only recognised when it is considered highly probable that a  significant revenue reversal will not occur once the underlying  uncertainty related to variable consideration is subsequently  resolved.   ii.   Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements     The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and  supply arrangements that, in certain instances, include certain  performance obligations. Based on an evaluation of whether  or not these obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory, the  Company recognise or defer the upfront payments received  under these arrangements.     Income from out-licensing agreements typically arises from the  receipt of upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third  parties for granting a license to product- or technology- related  intellectual property (IP). These agreements may be entered  into with no further obligation or may include commitments to  regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may  be settled by a combination of upfront payments, milestone  payments and other fees. These arrangements typically also  consist of subsequent payments dependent on achieving  certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in  the agreement. Milestone payments which are contingent on  achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues  either on achievement of such milestones, if the   milestones are  considered substantive, or over the period we have continuing  performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered  substantive. Whether to consider these commitments as a single  performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope  of Ind-AS 115‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers, is not  straightforward and requires some judgement. Depending on  the conclusion, this may result in all revenue being calculated  at inception and either being recognised at point in time or  spread over the term of a longer performance obligation.  Where performance obligations may not be distinct, this will  bundled with the subsequent product supply obligations. The  new standard provides an exemption for sales-based royalties  for licenses of intellectual property which will continue to be  recognised as revenue as underlying sales are incurred.     The Company recognises a deferred income (contract liability)  if consideration has been received (or has become receivable)  before the company transfers the promised goods or services  to the customer. Deferred income mainly relates to remaining  performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term  contracts or are related to amounts the Company expects to  receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred  to customers under existing, non-cancellable or otherwise  enforceable contracts.     Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue  earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as  unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there  is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is  required, as per contractual terms.   iii.   Royalty income and profit share     The Royalty income and profit share earned through a License or  collaboration partners is recognised as the underlying sales are  recorded by the Licensee or collaboration partners.   iv.   Sales Return Allowances     The Company accounts for sales return by recording an  allowance for sales return concurrent with the recognition of  revenue at the time of a product sale. The allowance is based on  Company’s estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of  sales return is determined primarily by the Company’s historical  experience in the markets in which the Company operates.   v.   Dividends     Dividend is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the  payment is established, which is generally when shareholders  approve the dividend.   vi.   Rental income     Rental income from investment property is recognised in  statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term  of the lease except where the rentals are structured to increase in  line with expected general inflation. Lease incentives granted are  recognised as an integral part of the total rental income, over the  term of the lease.   vii.   Contribution received from customers/co-development  partners towards plant and equipment     Contributions received from customers/co-development  partners towards items of property, plant and equipment  which require an obligation to supply goods to the customer in  the future, are recognised as a credit to deferred revenue. The  contribution received is recognised as revenue from operations  over the useful life of the assets. The Company capitalises the  gross cost of these assets as the Company controls these assets.   viii.   Interest income and expense     Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective  interest method. l.   Government grants   The Company recognises government grants at their fair value only  when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached  to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received.  Government grants received in relation to assets are recognised as  deferred income and amortised over the useful life of such asset.  Government grants, which are revenue in nature are either recognised  as income or deducted in reporting the related expense based on the  terms of the grant, as applicable. 293 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 m.   Income taxes   Income tax comprises of current and deferred income tax. Income tax  expense is recognised in statement of profit and loss except to the  extent that it relates to an item recognised directly in equity in which  case it is recognised in other comprehensive income. Current income  tax for current year and prior periods is recognised at the amount  expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities, using the  tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by  the balance sheet date.   Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally  enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is  intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or  simultaneously.   Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all  temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except  when:   —   temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets  or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination  and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at  the time of transaction; and   —   temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries,  associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the  Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the  temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse  in the foreseeable future.   Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are  reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax  benefit will be realised.   Deferred tax assets (DTA) in accordance with the tax laws in India, which  is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of  set off against future income tax liability.   Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax  rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by  the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income  in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be  recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred  income tax assets and liabilities is recognised as income or expense  in the period that includes the enactment or substantive enactment  date. A deferred income tax assets is recognised to the extent it is  probable that future taxable income will be available against which  the deductible temporary timing differences and tax losses can be  utilised. The Company offsets income-tax assets and liabilities, where it  has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and  where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset  and settle the liability simultaneously.   Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting  date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that  future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used n.   Borrowing cost     Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including exchange  differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent  that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) incurred  in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly  attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset which necessarily  take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are  capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are  recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.   Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of  time to get ready for their intended use or sale. o.   Earnings per share   Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average  number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted for  treasury shares held. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the  weighted-average number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares  outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for  options and warrants, except where the results would be anti-dilutive. p.   Leases   (i)   The Company as lessee:     The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at  the inception of contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the  contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified  asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To  assesses whether a contract conveys the right to control use of  an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:     • The contract involves use of an identified asset;     • The Company has substantially all the economic benefits from  the use of the asset through the period of lease; and     • The Company has the right to direct the use of an asset.     At the date of commencement of lease, the Company recognises  a Right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding liability for  all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases  with the term of twelve months or less (short term leases)  and low value leases. For short term and low value leases, the  Company recognises the lease payment as an operating expense  on straight line basis over the term of lease.  Certain lease  agreements include an option to extend or terminate the lease  before the end of lease term. ROU assets and the lease liabilities  includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will  be exercised.     Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement  date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term  and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are  evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in  circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not  be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the  recoverable amount (i.e., higher of fair value less cost to sell  294 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the standalone financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 and the value-in-use) is determined on individual asset basis  unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely  independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the  recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit  (CGU) to which the asset belongs.     The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the  present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments  are discounted using the interest rate explicit in the lease or, if  not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing  rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities  are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related  right-of- use assets if the Company changes its assessment if  whether it will exercise an extension or a termination of option.     Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in  the Balance Sheet and the lease payments have been classified  as financing cash flows.   (ii)   The Company as a Lessor:     Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance  or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer  substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership to the lessee,  the contract is classified as finance lease. All other leases are  classified as operating lease. q.   Operating cycle   The Company classifies an asset as current asset when:      it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in  its normal operating cycle;      it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading;      it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the  reporting period; or    the asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted  from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least  twelve months after the reporting period.   All other assets are classified as non-current.   A liability is classified as current when –    it expects to settle the liability, or consume it, in its normal  operating cycle;    it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading;    the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the  reporting period; or    it does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of  the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.  Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty,  result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not  affect its classification.   All other liabilities are classified as non-current.   The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for  processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The  Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle. r.   Exceptional items   Exceptional items refer to items of income or expense within the  statement of profit and loss from ordinary activities which are non- recurring and are of such size, nature or incidence that their separate  disclosure is considered necessary to explain the performance of the  Company. s.   Recent pronouncements   Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or  amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the  year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance  Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, relating to sale and  leaseback transactions, applicable to the Company w.e.f. April 1, 2024.  The Company has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on  its evaluation has determined that it does not have any significant  impact in its financial statements.   Code on Social Security, 2020   The Indian Parliament has approved the Code on Social Security, 2020  which would impact the contributions by the Company towards  Provident Fund and Gratuity. The Ministry of Labour and Employment  had released draft rules for the Code on Social Security, 2020 on  November 13, 2020. The Company will assess the impact and its  evaluation once the subject rules are notified. The Company will give  appropriate impact in its financial statements in the period in which,  the Code becomes effective and the related rules to determine the  financial impact are published. 295 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Employee benefit plans   (i)   The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under this legislation, employee who has completed  five years of service is entitled to specific benefit. The level of benefits provided depends on the employee’s length of service and salary at  retirement/termination age and does not have any maximum monetary limit for payments. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Company  makes contributions to a recognised fund in India.     The plans assets are maintained with HDFC Life  in respect of gratuity scheme for certain employees of the Company. The details of investments  maintained by Life Insurance Corporation are not available with the Company, hence not disclosed. The expected rate of return on plan assets is  6.6% p.a. (31 March 2024: 7.2 % p.a.).     The cost of the defined benefit plans and other long term benefits are determined using actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations involve making  various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These includes the determination of the discount rate, future salary  increases and mortality rate. Due to these complexity involved in the valuation it is highly sensitive to the changes in these assumptions. All  assumptions are reviewed at reporting date. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost and planned  service cost were measured using the projected unit cost method.     The following table sets out the status of the gratuity plan and the amounts recognised in the Company’s financial statements as at balance sheet  date: Particulars Present value of  defined benefit  obligation Fair value of    plan assets Net defined  benefit (asset)/ liability Balance as on April 01, 2024  403   (8)  395  Current service cost  39    -     39  Interest expense/(income)  29    -     29  Amount recognised in Statement of profit and loss  68    -     68  Remeasurements: Return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in interest expense/ (income)   -     - *    -    Actuarial (gain)/loss arising from:   -      -      -    Financial assumptions  13    -     13  Experience adjustment  12    -     12  Amount recognised in other comprehensive income  25    -     25  Employers contribution   -      -      -    Benefits paid  (44)   -     (44) Balance as at March 31, 2025  452   (8)  444  Particulars Present value of  defined benefit  obligation Fair value of    plan assets Net defined  benefit   (asset)/liability Balance as on April 01, 2023  361   (7)  354  Current service cost  35    -     35  Interest expense/(income)  26   (1)  25  Amount recognised in Statement of profit and loss  61   (1)  60  Remeasurements: Return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in interest expense/ (income)   -     - *    -    Actuarial (gain)/loss arising from:   -      -    Demographic assumptions   -      -      -    Financial assumptions  2    -     2  Experience adjustment  17    -     17  Amount recognised in other comprehensive income  19    -     19  Employers contribution   -      -      -    Benefits paid  (38)   -     (38) Balance as at March 31, 2024  403   (8)  395  322 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited

The Company pursuant to Karnataka Compulsory Gratuity Rules, 2024 (Gratuity Rules) has amended its Gratuity trust for compliance with Gratuity  Rules, Income Tax Act, 1961 and other laws, as applicable. The amended Gratuity trust in compliance with the above rules is approved by Board  of Directors of the Company in its meeting dated April 24, 2024 and under process of filing with the Commissioner of Income tax for approval.  Accordingly, the Company expects to contribute its obligation under the Gratuity scheme pursuant to receipt of this approval. (ii)   The assumptions used for gratuity valuation are as below: March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Interest rate 6.6% 7.2% Discount rate 6.6% 7.2% Expected return on plan assets 6.6% 7.3% Salary increase 9.0% 9.0% Attrition rate 14% - 30% 14% - 30% Retirement age - Years  58   58    Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and mortality tables as per IALM  (2012-14)   The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 6 years (March 31, 2024 - 6 years).   The defined benefit plan exposes the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity and interest rate risk. (iii)   Sensitivity analysis   The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions are as below: Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate (1% Change)  (21)  23   (18)  20  Salary increase (1% Change)  22   (20)  19   (18) Attrition rate (1% Change)  (4)  4   (3)  3    Sensitivity of significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of defined benefit obligation  by one percentage, keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows  expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumption shown.   As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the plan assets have been invested in insurer managed funds and the expected contribution to the fund  during the year ending March 31, 2026, is approximately Rs 60 (March 31, 2025 - Rs 56).

Employee benefit plans (continued..) (iv)   Risk exposure   These defined benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks as under:   a)   Investment Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to  market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.   b)   Interest rate risk: A decrease in bond interest rate will increase the plan liability.   c)   Longevity risk: The present value of the desfined plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants.  An increase in the life expectancy will increase the plan’s liability.   d)   Salary risk: Higher than expected increase in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.

(c)   The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties. Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques in consultation  with market expert. The most frequently applied valuation technique include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes Merton Model (for  options valuation), using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange forward rates, interest rate curve  and forward rates curve. * Investment in equity shares in subsidiaries, associate and joint venture and investment in preference shares of associates has been accounted at cost as per  Ind AS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”. # These includes investment in preference shares in subsidiaries which are convertible (variable number of equity shares) / redeemable, at its face value,  any time during the tenure of the instrument at the option of the holder. Owing to this feature, the instrument has been disclosed at its fair value which is  equivalent to the face value. B.    Measurement of fair values Fair value of liquid mutual funds are based on quoted price. Derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities  in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place.

Financial risk management   The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:   - Credit risk   - Liquidity risk   - Market risk   (i)    Risk management framework     The Company’s risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides  written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk,  use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.   (ii)   Credit risk     Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to financial loss.  The credit risk arises principally from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with  banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments.     Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer  credit risk management. The Audit and Risk Management Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed  individually for creditworthiness before the Company’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Company’s review  includes external ratings, where available, and other publicly available financial information. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly  monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.     The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables.  The maximum exposure to credit risk as at reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to Rs. 8,294 (March 31, 2024: Rs. 10,481).  The movement in allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables during the year was as follows: 326 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited

Refer note 12 for ageing of trade receivables.     Other than trade receivables, the Company has no significant class of financial assets that is past due but not impaired. 36. Financial instruments: Fair value and risk managements (continued...)     The Company is no significantly exposed to geographical credit risk as the counterparties operate across various countries across the globe. Also  refer geographical Revenues disclosure in Note 21.1.     Credit risk on cash and cash equivalent and derivatives is limited as the Company generally transacts with banks and financial institutions with high  credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies which are rated  A+ or AAA. Investments primarily include investment  in liquid mutual fund units, bonds and non-convertible debentures. (iii)    Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled  by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient  liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage  to the Company’s reputation.   The Company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.   The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities and excluding interest payments. The tables have been drawn up based on the  undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Company can be required to pay:   March 31, 2025 Particulars Less than 1 year 1 - 2 years 2-5 years More than 5 years Total Borrowings [refer note (b) below]  6,195   21,661   854    -     28,710  Trade payables  8,144    -      -      -     8,144  Other financial liabilities [refer note  (a) below]  1,340   11    -      -     1,351  Lease Liabilities  26   24   3    -     53  Total  15,705   21,696   857    -     38,258    March  31,  2024              Particulars Less than 1 year 1 - 2 years 2-5 years More than 5 years Total Borrowings [refer note (b) below]   -     521   19,887    -     20,408  Trade payables  4,476    -      -      -     4,476  Other financial liabilities [refer note  (a) below]  779    -     221    -     1,000  Lease Liabilities  13   21    -      -     34  Total  5,268   542   20,108    -     25,918    (a)   Other financial liabilities amounting to Rs. 8 (March 31, 2024: Rs. 221) relates to mark to market valuation of the put options fully described in note  34(ii)(b), (c), (d) and (e) to these financial statements.

Foreign currency risk   The Company operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently, the Company is exposed  to foreign exchange risk through operating and borrowing activities in foreign currency. The Company holds derivative instruments such as foreign  exchange forward, interest rate swaps and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates and foreign currency exposure.   The currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 are as below: March 31, 2025 USD EUR Others Total Financial assets Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents  2,355   228   3   2,586  Other financial assets  1,127   102   7   1,236   91    -      -     91  Financial liabilities Trade payables Borrowings  (3,260)  (163)  (27)  (3,450) Other financial liabilities  (2,136)  -   -   (2,136)  (27)  (5)  (9)  (41) Net assets/(liabilities)  (1,850)  162   (26)  (1,714) March 31, 2024 USD EUR Others Total Financial assets Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents  2,271   287    -     2,558  Other financial assets  472   51   8   531   190    -      -     190  Financial liabilities Trade payables Borrowings  (449)  (22)  (22)  (493) Other financial liabilities  (2,084)  -   -   (2,084)  (230)  (13)  (6)  (249) Net assets/(liabilities)  170   303   (20)  453    Sensitivity analysis   The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in exchange rates arises mainly from foreign currency denominated financial instruments and the impact on  other components of equity arises from foreign exchange forward/option contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

Financial instruments: Fair value and risk managements (continued...)   Derivative financial instruments   The Company uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its commercial business or financing activities.  The Company’s treasury team manages its foreign currency risk by hedging forecasted transactions like sales, purchases and capital expenditures.  When a derivative is entered for hedging, the Company matches the terms of those derivatives to the underlying exposure. All identified exposures are  managed as per the policy duly approved by the Board of Directors.   The following table gives details in respect of outstanding foreign exchange forward, option and interest rate swaps contracts: Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 (in Million) Interest rate swaps used for hedging LIBOR component in External Commercial Borrowings  USD 25 USD 25 with periodical maturity dates between 0-5 Years European style range forward contracts with periodical maturity dates between 0-2 Years USD 98 USD 127   All of the above contracts are effective as at March 31,2025 and March 31, 2024 and designated through other comprehensive income.   Also refer note 36 E (iii) (a) related to put options obligation as per the agreement with the lenders.   Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk   The Company’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk.  During the year ended March 31, 2024 the Company’s borrowings at variable interest rate exposing to cash flow variability is mainly denominated in  USD, other than NCD which is denominated in Indian Rupees. Further, the NCD issued is at a minimum return of 12% per annum plus agreed variable  coupon payable upon redemption. The variable coupon is linked to the equity share price of a subsidiary.   (a)    Interest rate risk exposure     The exposure of the Company’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows: Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Fixed rate borrowings  7,797   2,084  Variable rate borrowings  20,913   18,324  Total borrowings  28,710   20,408    (b)    Sensitivity     The Company policy is to maintain most of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary. They are therefore  not subject to interest rate risk as defined under Ind AS 107. Refer note 36C for sensitivity disclosure of NCD. 37. Capital management The key objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity to uphold  investor, creditor, and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its business. The Company focused on keeping strong total equity base  to ensure independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the  Company. The Company’s goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual dividends in future periods. The amount of future dividends of equity shares will be balanced with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status. The capital structure as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 was as follows: Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Total equity attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company  115,244   109,123  As a percentage of total capital 80% 84% Borrowings  28,710   20,408  Total borrowings  28,710   20,408  Debt equity ratio 20% 16% Total capital (Equity and Borrowings)  143,954   129,531  329 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of Biocon Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of  Biocon Limited  (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) its employee welfare  trusts and its subsidiaries (Holding Company, its employee welfare trusts  and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), its associate and  its joint venture, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31  March 2025, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including  other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in  equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended,  and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material  accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred  to as “the consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the  explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of report of the  other auditor on separate financial statements/financial information of such  subsidiary as were audited by the other auditor, the aforesaid consolidated  financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act,  2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in  conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of  the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its associate and joint venture  as at 31 March 2025, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive  income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the  year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with  the  Standards  on  Auditing    (SAs)  specified  under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under  those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the  Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are  independent of the Group, its associate and joint venture in accordance with  the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated  financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and  we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with  the consideration of reports of the other auditor referred to in paragraph (a)  of the “Other Matters” section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the  current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Revenue See Note 2(l) and Note 21 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit One of the subsidiaries of the Group derives revenue from contract research,  development and manufacturing activities. Overstatement of revenue is a presumed fraud risk considering the  subsidiary has pressure to meet external market expectations of reporting  higher revenues. The subsidiary has various contractual arrangements with customers  which are entered into at various stages of research and development.  The Company, in line with Ind AS 115, recognises revenue based on the  contractual terms and performance obligations with customers. The subsidiary, in certain instances, also has bill and hold arrangements  that meet the criteria mentioned for such arrangements under Ind AS 115:  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, wherein revenues are recognized  prior to the physical transfer of the goods on the basis of specific requests  from the customers to hold back the delivery of goods at period end. The above factors result in revenue from contract research and  manufacturing service income being identified as a Key Audit Matter. Our audit procedures in relation to revenue recognition includes the  following: •   We have assessed the appropriateness of the subsidiary’s revenue  recognition accounting policies and assessed compliance with the  policies in terms of applicable accounting standards. •   We tested the design and implementation, operating effectiveness  of the subsidiary’s controls around revenue recognition including  general IT controls and key IT application controls. •   We have performed substantive testing (including year-end cut-off  testing) by selecting samples of revenue transactions recorded during  the year and verifying the underlying documents, which includes sales  invoices/contracts, shipping and delivery documents. •   We have tested the specific requests from customers at the period  end to evaluate transfer of control relating to the bill and hold  arrangements. We evaluated the timing of recognition of revenue  from these arrangements proposed by the subsidiary for compliance  with Ind AS 115: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. •   We have assessed manual journal entries posted to revenue to identify  unusual items not already covered by our audit testing. 334 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Independent Auditor’s Report (continued...) Chargeback, rebates, returns, other adjustments and related accruals See Note 2(l) and Note 21 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit A significant part of the Group’s sales consists of chargeback, rebates, returns,  other adjustments and their related accruals (referred to as ‘deductions to  gross sales’). Estimating the amounts of deductions to be accrued as at  the period end requires significant estimation and degree of subjectivity  as management’s model utilizes historical buying patterns of distributors/  whole- sellers/other customers, estimated end-user demand, estimated  inventory levels in the distribution channel, contracted sales terms with  customers, as well as other competitive factors. The Group has engaged  professional service providers to assist them in determining the year-end  accruals in respect of its biosimilar business. This was an area of focus in our audit due to the significant value of the  arrangements, their inherent complexity, and the substantial judgement  and estimation required by the Group in computing accruals. Accordingly,  we have determined this as a Key Audit Matter. Our audit procedures in relation to the charge-back / deductions included  the following: •   Assessed the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies  and assessed compliance with the policies in terms of applicable  accounting standards. •   Assessed journal entries posted in respect of these deductions to  identify unusual items not already covered by our audit testing. •   Tested the design and implementation of Group’s controls around  accruals for deductions. •   Obtained the computation for year-end accruals of chargebacks/  deductions which were determined by the Group in respect of its  biosimilar business and tested the underlying assumptions used  by reference to the Group’s stated commercial policies, applicable  contracts and historical product returns and other claims / allowances. •   Performed test of details on the actual claims processed during the  year towards chargebacks, rebates, sales return and other allowances  etc. to determine the accuracy of deductions to gross sales. •   Compared prior period accruals to subsequent claims processed  to evaluate management’s ability to forecast year end accruals for  deductions to gross sales. •   Performed analytical procedures on deductions to sales adjustments  recognised during the year to identify any unusual variances /  relationships. •   For each of the estimated accruals, tested the mathematical accuracy  of the computation and verified the underlying data used for  completeness and accuracy. Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and intangible assets under development See Note 2(e), 4 and 43 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group’s subsidiaries has recorded goodwill, intangible assets and  intangible assets under development of Rs. 167,593 million,  Rs.  57,590    million  and  Rs.   43,119 million respectively as at 31 March 2025. Most of  these were recorded pursuant to the purchase price allocation in respect of  the acquisition of Viatris’s biosimilar business in the previous years. Further,  in some cases, the products are yet to be launched or in their initial stages of  commercialization and hence revenue and profitability are yet to reach its  desired levels. Hence, there is a risk of impairment in the event the carrying  amount of the CGU is lower than its recoverable value. These assets are subjected to impairment test as part of Cash Generating  Units (CGU) which include goodwill. The annual impairment testing of  goodwill, intangible assets and intangible assets under development within  such CGU was considered to be a key audit matter due to the complexity  of the accounting requirements and the significant judgement involved  to estimate the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the CGU,  which is the value in use has been derived from discounted forecast cash  flow model. The discounted cash flow model involves a high degree of  subjectivity, including key assumptions like the estimates of revenue  growth, weighted-average cost of capital, expected market share, price  erosion, expected regulatory approval and its consequential impact on  the gross margin of the products sold. This assessment of discount rate  and terminal growth rate requires specialized skills and knowledge. These  significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future  economic and market conditions. Further, changes to these assumptions  could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount of the CGUs and  could lead to an impairment to the carrying value of these assets. Accordingly, we have determined this to be a key Audit Matter. Our audit procedures in relation to impairment testing includes the  following: •   We have tested the design and operating effectiveness of the  subsidiary’s controls around the impairment testing which included  review of significant assumptions such as estimated revenue, inputs  given to the Company’s specialist and validating the outputs shared  by the specialist. •   Evaluated all the assumptions used by the subsidiary in assessing the  recoverability of assets and involved valuation specialists to assist us in  evaluating the valuation methodologies. •   Evaluated the subsidiary’s assessment of key inputs by considering  third party sources and the impact on future cash inflows due to  actions by competitors or changes in relevant market conditions; •   We corroborated the revenue projections with the annual board  approved plan and the reasonableness of the revenue growth factored  in the projections. •   Performed the sensitivity analysis in respect of certain key assumptions  to evaluate the impact of change on recoverable value. We have  assessed the historical accuracy by comparing past forecasts to actual  results achieved. •   Tested the adequacy of disclosures made in consolidated financial  statements, as required by Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets. 335 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Going concern See Note 1.2 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit In respect of agreements entered into by the Group with certain financial  investors for acquisition of biosimilar business, there are put option  obligations on the Company to provide exit to the investors. The Company  also has certain long-term borrowings that carry drag along rights which  require the Company to repay the debts if the put options, as mentioned  above, are triggered. As at 31 March 2025, these contractual agreements  indicate possible obligations as described in note 1.2 to the financial  statements. The Group has performed an assessment of its financial position as at 31  March 2025 and the forecasts for a period of fifteen months from the date  of these financial statements. In addition, Group considered projected cash  flows, re- financing of existing borrowings, liquidity from non-current assets,  ability to raise funds by issuance of further shares as stated in note 48(d)  to the consolidated financial statements and re-negotiating the exit terms  with financial investors. These factors involve subjectivity that some of these are driven by external  environment and hence outcomes could be different from those factored  by the Group. Considering significance of the issue it is considered as a Key  Audit Matter. Our audit procedures to assess the going concern assumption included the  following: •   Obtained the forecasted statement of profit and loss and cashflows  prepared by the Management for the next 15 months. •   Gained an understanding and assessed the design, implementation  and operating effectiveness of Company and subsidiary’s key internal  controls over preparation of cash flow forecasts to assess its liquidity. •   Compared the forecasted statement of profit and loss and cash flows  with the business plan approved by the board of directors; evaluated  the key assumptions in the cash flow forecasts with reference to  historical information, current performance, future plans, and market  and other external available information. •   Performed sensitivity analysis on the forecasted statement of profit  and loss and cash flows by considering plausible changes to the key  assumptions. •   Reviewed the share purchase agreement with investors. •   Discussed with Audit Committee and key senior management  personnel regarding the Company’s plan to meet the obligations. •   Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures – refer note 1.2 to the  financial statements. Financial instruments See Note 16(a) to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group is a party to certain financial instruments that are carried at fair  value through profit and loss. These financial instruments primarily pertain to  the contingent consideration payable, which the Group had accounted for  in connection with the acquisition of biosimilar business in previous years,  as well as certain debentures issued by the Group. Fair valuation of these  financial instruments involve application of complex pricing models which  involves high degree of subjectivity, including key assumptions such as  probability of various outcomes related to the instruments regarding factors  that are contractually agreed with the counterparties. As of 31 March 2025,  the Group had Rs. 8,970 million in derivative liabilities arising on account of  contingent consideration. The fair valuation of these financial instruments  is categorized as ‘Level 3’ fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy  due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair  value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market  participants would use in pricing the financial instruments. The Group engaged third party valuation experts (management’s expert) to  assist in determining the fair value of the financial instruments as described  above. The valuation of these financial instruments are complex and requires  significant judgment due to the use of complex pricing models and the  high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to  estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. Accordingly, we have  determined this to be a Key Audit Matter. We have performed the following audit procedures in relation to the  financial instruments: •   Read the underlying agreements for these financial instruments  to understand the terms of these instruments and tested the key  contractual inputs. •   Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Group’s control  around the valuation of these financial instruments. •   Involved valuation specialists to assist in reviewing the valuation reports  prepared by the Group’s valuation experts. These specialists assessed  the fair value of these instruments, evaluated the pricing model  used for valuing the financial instruments, and tested the significant  assumptions and reasonableness of the derivative component. •   Reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements in relation to the  financial instruments.

Taxation See Note 2(n), 34 and 38 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group operates across various tax jurisdictions around the world and  is subject to complexities with respect to various tax positions on matters  such as: -   deductibility of transactions -   recoverability of deferred tax asset for subsidiary -     Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to  interpretation. Judgment is required in assessing the range of possible outcomes for some  of these tax matters. These judgments could change over time as each of  the matter progresses depending on the experience of actual assessment  proceedings by tax authorities and other judicial precedents. The Group makes an assessment (including obtaining opinion from external  legal  experts) to determine the outcome of these uncertain tax positions  and decides to make an accrual or consider it to be a possible contingent  liability. Where the amount of tax liabilities are uncertain, the Group  recognizes accruals which reflect its best estimate of the outcome based on  the facts known in the relevant jurisdiction. Biocon Biologics Limited, has recognised deferred tax assets (DTA) carried  forward losses (hereinafter referred to as “tax losses”) and recognised MAT  credit on the basis of the Company’s assessment of availability of future  taxable profit to offset such tax losses based on business projections. The  recoverability of the deferred tax assets depends upon factors such as  the projected taxable profitability of business and the period considered  for such projections, the rate at which those profits will be taxed and the  period over which tax losses will be available for recovery. The amount is  material to the financial statements and significant judgement and estimate  is involved in the preparation of forecasts of future taxable profits based on  the underlying business plans. Considering the above, this was determined to be a Key Audit Matter for  the engagement team during the audit for the year ended 31 March 2025. We performed the following audit procedures: •   Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Group’s controls  around the tax computation and tax matters; •   Obtained an understanding of the key uncertain tax positions based  on list of ongoing litigations and tax computations for the current year; •   Assessed the implications of correspondence received by the Group  from the relevant tax authorities to identify any additional uncertain  tax positions; •   Assessed the Group’s judgment regarding the eventual resolution of  matters with various tax authorities. In this regard, we understood how  the Group has considered past experience, where available, with the  tax authorities in the respective jurisdictions; •   Examined external tax counsel opinions and consultations obtained  by the Group for key matters during current and past periods, as  relevant; and •   Involved tax specialists to assist us in evaluating the technical merits  of tax position to form a judgement and the key assumptions made  by the Group in tax computations and assessing the adequacy of the  Group’s disclosures in respect of contingent liabilities and provision for  tax matters. •   Understanding Management’s selection and application of methods,  selection of assumptions and data, used in estimates for assessment of  recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses and MAT credit. •   Involved tax specialists’ to assess key assumptions made by the  management for the recoverability of Deferred tax asset on tax losses. •   Retrospective review of the projections used in the assessment when  compared to historical performance and assessing the sensitivity of  key assumptions.

The other information comprises the Management  reports such as Board Report, Management Discussion and Analysis, Corporate Governance Report and Business Responsibility Report, but does not include  the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the remaining sections of the Annual  Report, which are expected to be made available to us after that date. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance  conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so,  consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a  material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. When we read the other sections of Annual Report (other than those mentioned above), if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are  required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations. 337 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Management’s and Board of Directors’/ Board of Trustees’  Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the preparation and presentation of these  consolidated    financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true  and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and  other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity  and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its associate and joint  venture in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in  India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under  Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors  of the companies included in the Group and of its associate and joint  venture are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in  accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each  company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,  that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation  of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which  have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial  statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding  Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective  Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the  Group and of its associate and joint venture are responsible for assessing  the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern  basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to  liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative  but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group  of its associate and joint venture are responsible for overseeing the financial  reporting process of each company. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will  always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can  arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial  statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We  also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,  design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,  and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from  error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also  responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company  has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made  by the Management and Board of Directors. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of  Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation  of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness  of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are  based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and  its associate and joint venture to cease to continue as a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and  whether the consolidated financial statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair  presentation. •   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial  statements/financial information of such entities or business  activities within the Group and its associate and joint venture to  express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We  are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of  the audit of the financial statements/financial information of such  entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which  we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in  the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by  other auditor, such other auditor remain responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We  remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in  this regard are further described in paragraph (a) of the section titled  “Other Matters” in this audit report. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding  Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial  statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among  Independent Auditor’s Report (continued...) 338 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that  we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we  have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence,  and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,  related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we  determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore  the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report  unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or  when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should  not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of  doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report  on the consolidated financial statements of Biocon Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025 Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause  (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act (Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) Opinion In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of  Biocon Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) as of and  for the year ended 31 March 2025, we have audited the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company and  such companies incorporated in India under the Act which are its subsidiary  companies, as of that date. In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated  in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, in all material respects,  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements  and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31  March 2025, based on the internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the  essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note  on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by  the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”). Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for  Internal Financial Controls The respective Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are  responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements criteria established by the respective company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These  responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively  for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including  adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its  assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of  reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our  audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing,  prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an  audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with  ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if  such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about  the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an  understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing  and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial Statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use,  or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material misstatements due  to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any  evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with  the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 1.   Company Overview 1.1   Reporting entity   Biocon Limited (“Biocon” or the “parent company” or “the Company”),  together with its subsidiaries, joint venture and associates (collectively,  the “Group”) is engaged in the manufacture of biotechnology products  and research services. The Company is a public limited company  incorporated and domiciled in India and has its registered office in  Biocon Campus, 20th KM, Hosur Road, Electronic City, Bengaluru – 560  100. The Company’s shares are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange  (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India. 1.2   Basis of preparation of financial statements   a)   Statement of compliance     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in  accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as per the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 notified  under Section 133 of Companies Act, 2013, (the ‘Act’) and other  relevant provisions of the Act.     These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for  the Group as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that  are effective at the Company’s annual reporting date, March 31,  2025.      The Group has net current asset position of Rs. 19,524 as at March  31, 2025. The Group has assessed its financial position as at March  31, 2025 and its forecasts for a period of fifteen months from the  date of these financial statements. As part of this assessment,  Management has considered the Put option obligation entered  by the Group with certain financial investors to provide exit to  the investors as described in note 16(a).     Management has assessed its ability to re-negotiate the exit  terms with financial investors, ability to raise funds as stated  in Note 48 (d), re-finance its existing borrowings and support  liquidity from its non current assets. Based on these factors,  management believes that the Group has sufficient financial  resources available to it at the date of approval of these financial  statements and has prepared its financial statements under  going concern assumption.     These consolidated financial statements are approved for  issuance by the Company’s Board of Directors on May 08, 2025.     Details of the Group’s significant accounting policies are included  in Note 2.   b)   Functional and presentation currency     These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian  rupees (INR), which is also the functional currency of the parent  Company. All amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest  million, unless otherwise indicated. In respect of subsidiaries and  associates whose operations are self-contained and integrated,  the functional currency has been determined to be the currency  of the primary economic environment in which the entity  operates.   c)   Basis of measurement     These consolidated financial statements have been prepared  on the historical cost basis (i.e. on accrual basis), except for the  following items:    Derivative Financial Instruments at fair value    Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair  value;    Net defined benefit assets/(liability) are measured at fair  value of plan assets, less present value of defined benefit  obligations    Contingent consideration assumed in a business  combination at fair value    Non-Convertible Debentures with variable coupon linked  to equity shares of the subsidiary at fair value    Non derivative financial instruments at Fair Value Through  Profit and Loss (FVTPL)   d.   Use of estimates and judgements     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in  conformity with Ind AS requires Management to make estimates,  judgements and assumptions. These estimates, judgements and  assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  during the period. Accounting estimates could change from  period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Appropriate changes in estimates are made as management  becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding  the estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the  financial statements in the period in which changes are made  and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements.    Judgements     Information about judgements made in applying accounting  policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts  recognised in the financial statements is included in the following  notes:     • Note 1.2(b)       — Assessment of functional currency;     • Note 2(c) and 36     — Financial instruments;     •  Note 2(d), 2(e) and 3   —    Useful lives of property, plant and  equipment and other intangible  assets     • Note 2(j) and 35      —    measurement  of  defined  benefit obligation; key actuarial  assumptions;     • Note 30         — Share based payments;      • Note 2(n), 7 and 38       —    Provision  for  income  taxes  and  related tax contingencies and  349 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Assumptions and estimation uncertainties     Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties  that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment  in the year ending March 31, 2025 is included in the following  notes:     —   Note 2(i) – impairment test of non-financial assets; key  assumptions underlying recoverable amounts including  the recoverability of expenditure on internally-generated  intangible assets;     —   Note 2(n), 7 and 38 – recognition of deferred tax assets:  uncertain tax treatment;     —   Note 2(l) and 21 - Revenue Recognition; estimate of  expected returns, chargebacks, rebates and other  allowances;     —   Note 17 and 34– recognition and measurement of  provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the  likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources;     —   Note 2(j) and 35 – measurement of defined benefit  obligations: key actuarial assumptions; and     —   Note 36 – impairment of financial assets : underlying  recoverable amount;     —   Note 2(i) and 43 - impairment test of goodwill: key  assumptions underlying recoverable amounts, including  the recoverability of development costs; and     —   Note 42 - acquisition of business: fair value of the  consideration transferred (including contingent  consideration) and fair value of the assets acquired and  liabilities assumed, measured on a provisional basis.   f.   Measurement of fair values     A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures  require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and  non-financial assets and liabilities.     Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value  hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques  as follows.     —   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities.     —   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level  1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).     —   Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs).     The Group has an established control framework with respect to  the measurement of fair values. This includes a finance team that  has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value  measurements, including Level 3 fair values.     The Group regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs  and valuation adjustments. If third party information is used to  measure fair values, then the finance team assesses the evidence  obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that  these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the  level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be  classified.     When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group  uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used  to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different  levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement  is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value  hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire  measurement.     The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value  hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the  change has occurred.     Further information about the assumptions made in measuring  fair values is included in the following notes:     —   Note 30     – Share-based payment arrangements     —   Note 36                 – Financial instruments     —   Note 42     – Business Combination 2   Material accounting policies a.   Basis of consolidation   i.   Subsidiaries     Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group  controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to,  variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has  the ability to affect those returns through its power over the  entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in  the consolidated financial statements from the date on which  control commences until the date on which control ceases.     The financial statements of the Group are consolidated on  line-by-line basis. Intra-group transactions, balances and any  unrealised gains arising from intra-group transactions, are  eliminated. Unrealised losses are eliminated, but only to the  extent that there is no evidence of impairment.  All temporary  differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses  resulting from intragroup transactions are recognised as per Ind  AS 12, Income Taxes. 350 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025     For the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial  statements, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been  changed where necessary to align them with the policies  adopted by the Group.     Non-controlling interests (NCI)     NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s  net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.     Changes in the Group’s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not  result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.   ii.   Loss of control     When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises  the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and  other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former  subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost.  Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit or  loss.   iii.   Associates and joint arrangements (equity accounted  investees)     The Group’s interests in equity accounted investees comprise  interests in associates and a joint venture.     An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant  influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and  operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which  the Group has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the  arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for  its liabilities.     Interests in associates and joint venture are accounted for using  the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost which  includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the  consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of  profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI) of equity-  accounted investees until the date on which significant influence  or joint control ceases.   iv.   Transactions eliminated on consolidation     Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income  and expenses (except for foreign currency transaction gains  or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.  Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted  investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent  of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are  eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the  extent that there is no evidence of impairment. b.   Foreign currency   i.   Foreign currency transactions     Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the  respective functional currencies of companies at the exchange  rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the  average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the  transaction.     Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate  at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that  are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated  into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair  value was determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that  are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are  translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  Exchange differences are recognised in statement of profit or  loss, except exchange differences arising from the translation of  the qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are  effective which are recognised in OCI.   ii.   Foreign operations     The assets and liabilities of foreign operations (subsidiaries,  associates, joint arrangements) including goodwill and fair value  adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into INR, the  functional currency of the Group, at the exchange rates at the  reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations  are translated into INR at the exchange rates at the dates of the  transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates  the actual rate at the date of the transaction.     Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in  OCI and accumulated in equity (as exchange differences on  translating the financial statements of a foreign operation),  except to the extent that the exchange differences are allocated  to NCI. c.   Financial instruments   i.   Recognition and initial measurement     Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially  recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets  and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.     A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair  value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss  (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its  acquisition or issue.   ii.   Classification and subsequent measurement    Financial  assets     On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at    —   amortised  cost;     —   Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) –  debt investment;     —   Fair value through other comprehensive income – equity  investment; or     —   Fair value through profit and loss 351 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025     Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial  recognition, except if and in the period the Group changes its  business model for managing financial assets.     A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of  the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:     —   the asset is held within a business model whose objective is  to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and     —   the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.     A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the  following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:     —   the asset is held within a business model whose objective  is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and  selling financial assets; and     —   the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.     On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for  trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent  changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI (designated as FVOCI  – equity investment). This election is made on an investment by  investment basis.     All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or  FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes  all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group  may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets  the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI  as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an  accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.     Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial assets at  FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at  fair value. Net gains and losses, including  any interest or dividend income, are  recognised in statement of profit or loss.  However, see Note 36 for derivatives  designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets at  amortised cost These assets are subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest  method. The amortised cost is reduced by  impairment losses. Interest income, foreign  exchange gains and losses and impairment  are recognised in statement of profit or  loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is  recognised in statement of profit or loss. Debt investments  at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured  at fair value. Interest income under  the effective interest method, foreign  exchange gains and losses and impairment  are recognised in statement of profit or loss.  Other net gains and losses are recognised  in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses  accumulated in OCI are reclassified to  statement of profit or loss. Equity  investments at  FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured  at fair value. Dividends are recognised as  income in statement of profit or loss unless  the dividend clearly represents a recovery  of part of the cost of the investment. Other  net gains and losses are recognised in OCI  and are not reclassified to profit or loss.     Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and  gains and losses     Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or  FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified  as held for trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such  on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured  at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest  expense, are recognised in statement of profit or loss. Other  financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign  exchange gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit  or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in  statement of profit or loss.   iii.   De-recognition of financial instruments    Financial  assets     The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual  rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it  transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a  transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of  ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the  Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks  and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the  financial asset.     When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows  from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement,  it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and  rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor  retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor  transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise  the transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing  involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an  associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated  liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and  obligations that the Group has retained. 352 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025    Financial  liabilities     The Group de-recognises a financial liability when its contractual  obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.     The Group also de-recognises a financial liability when its terms  are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms  are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability  based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The  difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability  extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms  is recognised in statement of profit or loss.   iv.   Offsetting     Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net  amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when,  the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the  amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to  realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.   v.   Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting     The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its  foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded  derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted  for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and  certain criteria are met.     Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to  initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and  changes therein are generally recognised in statement of profit  or loss.     The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments  to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly  probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign  exchange rates and interest rates.     At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group  documents the risk management objective and strategy  for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the  economic relationship between the hedged item and the  hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash  flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected  to offset each other.     Cash flow hedges     When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging  instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of  the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in other  equity under ‘effective portion of cash flow hedges’. The effective  portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is  recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair  value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis,  from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes  in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in  statement of profit or loss.     If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting  or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is  exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.  When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued,  the amount that has been accumulated in other equity remains  there until, for a hedge of a transaction resulting in recognition  of a non - financial item, it is included in the non - financial item’s  cost on its initial recognition or, for other cash flow hedges, it is  reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the  hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.     If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur,  then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity  are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.   vi.   Net investment hedges     When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial  liability is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of  a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion  of changes in the fair value of a derivative or foreign exchange  gains and losses for a non-derivative is recognised in OCI and  presented in other equity within equity. Any ineffective portion  of the changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign  exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is recognized  immediately in profit or loss. The amount recognised in OCI is  fully or partially reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification  adjustment on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign  operation, respectively   vii.   Treasury shares     The Group has created an Employee Welfare Trust (EWT) for  providing share-based payment to its employees. Own equity  instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised  at cost and deducted from equity. When the treasury shares  are issued to the employees by EWT, the amount received is  recognised as an increase in equity and the resultant gain / (loss)  is transferred to / from securities premium.   viii.   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise  cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an  original maturity of three months or less, which are subject  to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of  the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist  of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of  outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral  part of the Group’s cash management.   ix.   Cash dividend to equity holders     The Group recognises a liability to make cash distribution to  equity holders when the distribution is authorised and the  distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per  the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when  it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is  recognised directly in equity. Interim dividends are recorded as  353 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 a liability on the date of declaration by the Company’s Board of  Directors. d.   Property, plant and equipment   i.   Recognition and measurement     Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less  accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,  if any. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment  comprises its purchase price including import duty and non  refundable taxes or levies, any other costs directly attributable  to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use,  and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and  restoring the site on which it is located.     Expenditure incurred on startup and commissioning of the  project and/or substantial expansion, including the expenditure  incurred on trial runs (net of trial run receipts, if any) up to the date  of commencement of commercial production are capitalised.     If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate  items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.     Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and  equipment is recognised in statement of profit or loss.     Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that  the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure  will flow to the Group and cost can be measured reliably     Advances paid towards acquisition of property, plant and  equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date, are shown  under other non-current assets and cost of assets not ready for  intended use before the year end, are shown as capital work-in- progress.   ii.   Depreciation     Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property, plant  and equipment less their estimated residual values over their  estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Assets  acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter  of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably  certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the  lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated.     The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment for the current and comparative periods are as follows: Asset Assets Classification Management estimate of useful life Useful life as per  Schedule II Building Building 25-30 years 30 years Roads Building 5-12 years 5 years Plant and equipment (including Electrical  installation and Lab equipment ) Plant and Machinery 9-15 years 8-20 years Computers and servers Plant and Machinery 3 years 3-6 years Office equipment Plant and Machinery 3- 5 years 5 years Research and development equipment Research and development  equipment 9 years 5-10 years Furniture and fixtures Furniture and fixtures 6 years 10 years Vehicles Vehicles 6 years 6-10 years Leasehold improvements Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease period whichever  is lower Leasehold land Land  90 years or lease period  whichever is lower     Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate. Based on technical  evaluation and consequent advice, the management believes that its estimates of useful lives as given above best represent the period over which  management expects to use these assets.     Depreciation on additions (disposals) is provided on a pro-rata basis i.e. from (upto) the date on which asset is ready for use (disposed of).   iii.   Reclassification to investment property     When the use of a property changes from owner-occupied to investment property, the property is reclassified as investment property at its  carrying amount on the date of reclassification. 354 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 e.   Goodwill and other intangible assets   i.   Goodwill     For measurement of goodwill that arises on a business  combination. Subsequent measurement is at cost less any  accumulated impairment losses.   ii.   Other intangible assets     Internally generated: Research and development     Expenditure on research activities is recognised in statement of  profit or loss as incurred.     Development expenditure is capitalised as part of the cost of  the resulting intangible asset only if the expenditure can be  measured reliably, the product or process is technically and  commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable,  and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to  complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise,  it is recognised in statement of profit or loss as incurred.  Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is measured at cost  less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment  losses.    Others     Other intangible assets are initially measured at cost.  Subsequently, such intangible assets are measured at cost less  accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment  losses.   iii.   Subsequent expenditure     Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases  the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset  to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure  on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in  statement of profit or loss as incurred and cost can be measured  reliably.   iv.   Amortisation     Goodwill is not amortised and is tested for impairment annually.     Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over  the estimated useful life as follows:     —   Computer software      3-5 years     —   Marketing and Manufacturing rights   8-15 years     —   Developed technology rights   8-15 years    —   Brands   8-15  years     —   Customer related intangibles     5 years     Amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are  reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if  appropriate. f.   Investment property   Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or  for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary  course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or  services or for administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition,  an investment property is measured at cost. Subsequent to initial  recognition, investment property is measured at cost less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.   Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the  management believes a period of 25 years as representing the best  estimate of the period over which investment properties (which  are quite similar) are expected to be used. Accordingly, the Group  depreciates investment properties over a period of 25 years on a  straight-line basis. The useful life estimate of 25 years is different from  the indicative useful life of relevant type of buildings mentioned in Part  C of Schedule II to the Act i.e. 30 years.   Any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property is recognised in  statement of profit or loss. g.   Business combination   In accordance with Ind AS 103, Business combinations, the Group  accounts for business combinations after acquisition date using  the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.  In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a  business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities  acquired includes, at minimum, an input and substantive process and  whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.   The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured  at fair value as at the date the control is acquired (acquisition date), as  are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any gain on a bargain purchase  is recognised in the OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve  if there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying  the business combination as a bargain purchase. If there does not exist  clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business  combination as a bargain purchase, then gain on a bargain purchase is  recognised directly in equity as capital reserve.   Transaction costs/ acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred  and services are received, except if related to the issue of debt or  equity securities.   The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to  the settlement of pre-existing relationships with the acquiree. Such  amounts are generally recognised in the statement of profit and loss.   Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of  acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration (or right  to receive excess contingent consideration transferred) that meets  the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it  is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.  Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value  at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the  contingent consideration are recognized in profit or loss. 355 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025   If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by  the end of the reporting period in which the business combination  occurs, the Group reports in its financial statements provisional  amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.  During the measurement period, the Group retrospectively adjusts  the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date to reflect  new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed  as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have affected the  measurement of the amounts recognised as of that date.   During the measurement period, the Group also recognises additional  assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and  circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known,  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as  of that date.   The measurement period ends as soon as the Group receives the  information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed  as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not  obtainable but does not exceed one year from the acquisition date.    Business combinations – common control transaction   Business combination involving entities that are controlled by the  group is accounted for at carrying value. No adjustments are made to  reflect the fair values, or recognise any new assets or liabilities except  to harmonise accounting policies. The financial information in the  consolidated financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated  as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the  preceding period in the consolidated financial statements, irrespective  of the actual date of combination. The identity of the reserves are  preserved and the reserves of transferor becomes the reserves of the  transferee. The difference, if any between the amounts recorded as  share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of  cash and the amounts of share capital of the transferor is transferred to  amalgamation adjustment reserves and is presented separately from  other capital reserves. h.   Inventories   Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out formula, and  includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production  or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to  their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured  inventories and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share  of fixed production overheads based on normal operating capacity.   Provisions are made towards slow-moving and obsolete items based  on historical experience of utilisation on a product category basis,  which consideration of product lines and market conditions.   Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary  course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling  expenses. The net realisable value of work-in-progress is determined  with reference to the selling prices of related finished products.   Raw materials, components and other supplies held for use in the  production of finished products are not written down below cost  except in cases where material prices have declined and it is estimated  that the cost of the finished products will exceed their net realisable  value.   The comparison of cost and net realisable value is made on an item- by-item basis. i.   Impairment   i.   Impairment of financial assets   In accordance with Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, the Group applies  Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) model for measurement and recognition  of impairment loss on following:   —   financial assets measured at amortised cost; and   —   financial assets measured at FVOCI - debt investments.   Loss allowance for trade receivables with no significant financing  component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected  credit losses. For all other financial assets, ECL are measured at an  amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant  increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are  measured at lifetime ECL.   Loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost are  deducted from gross carrying amount of the assets. The amount of  ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the  reporting date is recognised as an impairment gain or loss in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.   ii.   Impairment of non-financial assets     The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any  indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If  any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount  is estimated and an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying  amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable  amount in the statement of profit or loss.     Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For the purpose  of impairment testing, goodwill arising from a business  combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are  expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.     The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is  higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value  in use is based on the estimated future cash flow, discounted  to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessment of the time value of money and the  risks specific to CGU (or the asset).     The Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting  date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount  is estimated. For impairment testing, assets that do not generate  independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash- generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents the smallest group  of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent  of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. 356 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025     Impairment loss recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated first  to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the  CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other  assets of the CGU (or Group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.     An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not subsequently  reversed. In respect of other assets for which impairment loss  has been recognised in prior periods, the Group reviews at each  reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has  decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if  there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the  recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only to the extent  that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation  or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. j.   Employee benefits   i.   Short-term employee benefits:     All employee benefits falling due within twelve months from  the end of the period in which the employees render the related  services are classified as short-term employee benefits, which  include benefits like salaries, wages, short term compensated  absences, performance incentives, etc. and are recognised as  expenses in the period in which the employee renders the  related service and measured accordingly.”   ii.   Post- employment benefits     Post-employment benefit plans are classified into defined  benefits plans and defined contribution plans as under:”    Gratuity     The Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (“the  Gratuity Plan”) covering the eligible employees of the Company  and its Indian subsidiaries. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump- sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death,  incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount  based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of the  employment with the Group.     Liability with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by  actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at  each balance sheet date using the projected unit credit method.     The Group recognises the net obligation of a defined benefit  plan as a liability in its balance sheet. Gains or losses through re- measurement of the net defined benefit liability are recognised  in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to  profit and loss in the subsequent periods. The actual return of  the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by  applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit  obligation is recognised in other comprehensive income. The  effect of any plan amendments are recognised in the statement  of profit and loss.    Provident  Fund     Eligible employees of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries  receive benefits from provident fund, which is a defined  contribution plan. Both the eligible employees and the  respective Companies make monthly contributions to the  Government administered provident fund scheme equal to a  specified percentage of the eligible employee’s salary. Amounts  collected under the provident fund plan are deposited with in  a government administered provident fund. The Companies  have no further obligation to the plan beyond its monthly  contributions.   iii.   Compensated absences     The Group has a policy on compensated absences which are both  accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected  cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by  actuarial valuation performed by an independent actuary at each  balance sheet date using the projected unit credit method on the  additional amount expected to be paid/availed as a result of the  unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet  date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is  recognised in the period in which the absences occur.   iv.   Share-based compensation     The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based payment  awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee  expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the  period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to  the awards. The amount recognised as expense is based on the  estimate of the number of awards for which the related service  and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such  that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on  the number of awards that do meet the related service and non- market vesting conditions at the vesting date.     The grant date fair value of options granted (net of estimated  forfeiture) to employees of the Group is recognised as an  employee expense.     The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of  the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The  increase in equity recognised in connection with share based  payment transaction is presented as a separate component  in equity under “share based payment reserve”. The amount  recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual  number of stock options that vest. For the option awards, grant  date fair value is determined under the option-pricing model  (Black-Scholes-Merton). Forfeitures are estimated at the time of  grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual  forfeitures materially differ from those estimates. k.   Provisions (other than for employee benefits)   A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible  obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not,  require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation  357 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of  resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.   A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group  has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated  reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will  be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by  discounting the expected future cash flows (representing the best  estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation  at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the  liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.  Expected future operating losses are not provided for.   Onerous contracts   A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic  benefits to be derived by the Group from the contract are lower than  the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value  of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and  the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before such a  provision is made, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the  assets associated with that contract. l.   Revenue from contracts with customers   The Group has implemented new standard Ind-AS 115 ‘Revenue from  Contracts with Customers’ effective April 1, 2018 using cumulative  effect method. The effect of initially applying this standard is  recognised at the date of initial application. The Group has evaluated  its open arrangements on out-licensing with reference to upfront non- refundable fees received in earlier periods and concluded that some  of the performance obligations may not be distinct and hence would  need to be bundled with the subsequent product supply obligations.  Accordingly standard is applied retrospectively only to contracts that  were not completed as at the date of initial application.   i.   Sale of goods     Revenue is recognised when a promise in a customer contract  (performance obligation) has been satisfied by transferring  control over the promised goods to the customer. Control over  a promised good refers to the ability to direct the use of, and  obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, those  goods. Control is usually transferred upon shipment, delivery  to, upon receipt of goods by the customer, in accordance with  the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customers.  However, in certain cases, revenue is recognized on sale of  products where shipment is on hold at specific request of the  customer provided performance obligation conditions has been  satisfied and control is transferred, with customer taking title of  the goods. The amount of revenue to be recognized (transaction  price) is based on the consideration expected to be received in  exchange for goods, excluding amounts collected on behalf of  third parties such as sales tax or other taxes directly linked to sales.  If a contract contains more than one performance obligation,  the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation  based on their relative stand-alone selling prices.     For contracts with distributors, no sales are recognised when  goods are physically transferred to the distributor under a  consignment arrangement, or if the distributor acts as an agent.  In such cases, sales are recognised when control over the goods  transfers to the end-customer, and distributor’s commissions are  presented within marketing and distribution.     The consideration received by the Group in exchange for  its goods may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is  only recognised when it is considered highly probable that a  significant revenue reversal will not occur once the underlying  uncertainty related to variable consideration is subsequently  resolved.     Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts     Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable  consideration, including discounts, rebates, governmental rebate  programs, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional  programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these  provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements  as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in  accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and trade payables  (if paid in cash).     Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid  payments    are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and  recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim  made by the wholesalers for the difference between the price at  which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the  net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company.  Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based  on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a  period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other  customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesalers/ other customers.     Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from  a complex series of judgements about future events and  uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.   ii.   Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements     The Group enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and  supply arrangements that, in certain instances, include certain  performance obligations. Based on an evaluation of whether  or not these obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory, the  Group recognise or defer the upfront payments received under  these arrangements.     Income from out-licensing agreements typically arises from the  receipt of upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third  parties for granting a license to product- or technology- related  intellectual property (IP). These agreements may be entered  into with no further obligation or may include commitments to  regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may  be settled by a combination of upfront payments, milestone  payments and other fees. These arrangements typically also  consist of subsequent payments dependent on achieving  358 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in  the agreement. Milestone payments which are contingent on  achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues  either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones  are considered substantive, or over the period of continuing  performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered  substantive. Whether to consider these commitments as a single  performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope  of Ind-AS 115 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’, is not  straightforward and requires some judgement. Depending on  the conclusion, this may result in all revenue being calculated  at inception and either being recognised at point in time or  spread over the term of a longer performance obligation. Where  performance obligations may not be distinct, this will bundled  with the subsequent product supply obligations.     The new standard provides an exemption for sales-based  royalties for licenses of intellectual property which will continue  to be recognised as revenue as underlying sales are incurred.     The Group recognises a deferred income (contract liability) if  consideration has been received (or has become receivable)  before the Group transfers the promised goods or services to  the customer. Deferred income mainly relates to remaining  performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term  contracts or are related to amounts the Group expects to receive  for goods and services that have not yet been transferred  to customers under existing, non-cancellable or otherwise  enforceable contracts.     Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue  earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as  unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there  is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is  required, as per contractual terms.   iii.   Contract research and manufacturing services income:     Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised  services or compounds to customers in an amount that reflects  the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those  services or compounds.     Arrangement with customers for Contract research and  manufacturing services income are either on a time-and-material  basis, fixed price or on a sale of compounds.     In respect of contracts involving research services, in case of ‘time  and materials’ contracts, contract research fee are recognised  as services are rendered, in accordance with the terms of the  contracts.     Revenues relating to fixed price contracts are recognised based  on the percentage of completion method determined based on  efforts expended as a proportion to total estimated efforts. The  Group monitors estimates of total contract revenue and cost on  a routine basis throughout the contract period. The cumulative  impact of any change in estimates of the contract revenue or  costs is reflected in the period in which the changes become  known. In the event that a loss is anticipated on a particular  contract, provision is made for the estimated loss.     In respect of contracts involving sale of compounds arising out  of contract research, revenue is recognised when a promise in a  customer contract (performance obligation) has been satisfied  by transferring control over the promised goods to the customer.  Control over a promised good refers to the ability to direct the  use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from,  those goods. Control is usually transferred upon shipment to the  customer. The amount of revenue to be recognised (transaction  price) is based on the consideration expected to be received in  exchange for goods, excluding amounts collected on behalf of  third parties such as sales tax or other taxes directly linked to sales.  If a contract contains more than one performance obligation,  the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation  based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. Revenue from  product sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated  rebates, cash discounts and estimates of product returns, all of  which are established at the time of sale.     The consideration received by the group in exchange for  its goods may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is  only recognised when it is considered highly probable that a  significant revenue reversal will not occur once the underlying  uncertainty related to variable consideration is subsequently  resolved.   iv.   Royalty income and profit share     The Royalty income and profit share earned through a License or  collaboration partners is recognized as the underlying sales are  recorded by the Licensee or collaboration partners.   v.    Sales Return Allowances     The Group accounts for sales return by recording an allowance  for sales return concurrent with the recognition of revenue at  the time of a product sale. The allowance is based on Group’s  estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales return is  determined primarily by the Group’s historical experience in the  markets in which the Group operates.   vi.    Dividends     Dividend is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the  payment is established, which is generally when shareholders  approve the dividend.   vii.    Rental income     Rental income from investment property is recognised in  statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term  of the lease except where the rentals are structured to increase in  line with expected general inflation. Lease incentives granted are  recognised as an integral part of the total rental income, over the  term of the lease. 359 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025   viii.   Contribution received from customers/co-development  partners towards plant and equipment     Contributions received from customers/co-development  partners towards items of property, plant and equipment  which require an obligation to supply goods to the customer in  the future, are recognised as a credit to deferred revenue. The  contribution received is recognised as revenue from operations  over the useful life of the assets. The Group capitalises the gross  cost of these assets as the Group controls these assets.   ix.   Interest income and expense     Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective  interest method. m.   Government grants   The Group recognizes government grants only when there is  reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be  complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants  received in relation to assets are recognised as deferred income and  amortized over the useful life of such asset. Government grants, which  are revenue in nature are either recognised as income or deducted  in reporting the related expense based on the terms of the grant, as  applicable. n.   Income taxes   Income tax comprises of current and deferred income tax. Income  tax expense is recognised in statement of profit or loss except to the  extent that it relates to an item recognised directly in equity in which  case it is recognised in other comprehensive income. Current income  tax for current year and prior periods is recognised at the amount  expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities, using the  tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted  by the balance sheet date. The amount of current tax reflects the best  estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after  considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes.   Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally  enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is  intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or  simultaneously.   Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all  temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except  when:   —   taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of  goodwill;   —   temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets  or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination  and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at  the time of transaction;   —   temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries,  associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group  is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary  differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the  foreseeable future.   Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are  reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax  benefit will be realized.   Deferred tax assets (DTA) include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid  in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future  economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future  income tax liability.   Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax    rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by  the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income  in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be  recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred  income tax assets and liabilities is recognised as income or expense  in the period that includes the enactment or substantive enactment  date. A deferred income tax assets is recognised to the extent it is  probable that future taxable income will be available against which  the deductible temporary timing differences and tax losses can be  utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed  earnings of subsidiaries where it is expected that the earnings of  the subsidiary will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The  Group offsets income-tax assets and liabilities, where it has a legally  enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and where it  intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle  the liability simultaneously.   Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting  date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that  future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. o.   Borrowing cost   Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including exchange  differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent  that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) incurred  in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly  attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset which necessarily  take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are  capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.   Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of  time to get ready for their intended use or sale. p.   Earnings per share   Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average  number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted for  treasury shares held. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the  weighted-average number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares  outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for  options and warrants, except where the results would be anti-dilutive. q.   Operating segments   An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages  in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur  360 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions  with any of the Group’s other components, and for which discrete  financial information is available. Operating segments are reported in  a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief  operating decision maker. The Chairperson and Managing Director  of the Company is responsible for allocating resources and assessing  performance of the operating segments and accordingly is identified  as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). All operating  segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the CODM to  make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and  assess their performance. r.   Leases   (i)   The Group as lessee:     The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the  inception of contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the  contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified  asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To  assesses whether a contract conveys the right to control use of  an identified asset, the Group assesses whether:     •    The contract involves use of an identified asset;     •   The Group has substantially all the economic benefits from  the use of the asset through the period of lease; and     •    The Group has the right to direct the use of an asset.     At the date of commencement of lease, the Group recognises  a Right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding liability for  all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases  with the term of twelve months or less (short term leases) and  low value leases. For short term and low value leases, the Group  recognises the lease payment as an operating expense on  straight line basis over the term of lease.     Certain lease agreements include an option to extend or  terminate the lease before the end of lease term. ROU assets and  the lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably  certain that they will be exercised.     Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement  date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term  and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are  evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in  circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not  be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the  recoverable amount (i.e., higher of fair value less cost to sell  and the value-in-use) is determined on individual asset basis  unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely  independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the  recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit  (CGU) to which the asset belongs.     The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the  present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments  are discounted using the interest rate explicit in the lease or, if  not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing  rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities  are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related  right-of- use assets if the Group changes its assessment if  whether it will exercise an extension or a termination of option.     Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in  the Balance Sheet and the lease payments have been classified  as financing cash flows.   (ii)   The Group as a Lessor:     Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance  or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer  substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership to the lessee,  the contract is classified as finance lease. All other leases are  classified as operating lease. s.   Operating cycle   The Group classifies an asset as current asset when:    it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in  its normal operating cycle;    it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading;    it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the  reporting period; or    the asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted  from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least  twelve months after the reporting period.   All other assets are classified as non-current.   A liability is classified as current when –    it expects to settle the liability or consume it, in its normal  operating cycle;    it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading;    the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the  reporting period; or    it does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of  the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.  Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty,  result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not  affect its classification.   All other liabilities are classified as non-current.   The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for  processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents The Group’s  normal operating cycle is twelve months. t.   Exceptional items   Exceptional items refer to items of income or expense within the  statement of profit and loss from ordinary activities which are non- recurring and are of such size, nature or incidence that their separate  disclosure is considered necessary to explain the performance of the  Group. 361 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Other financial liabilities (continued...) (i)    During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Group had entered into an agreement with Activ Pine LLP (‘Investor’) whereby the Investor has infused  Rs. 5,363 against issuance of equity shares of a subsidiary company, Biocon Biologics Limited (‘BBL’), which represents 2.44 % shareholding of BBL. The  consideration was received and equity shares were allotted on January 21, 2020.   During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Group had entered into an agreement with Tata Capital Growth Fund II (‘Investor’) whereby the Investor has  infused Rs 2,250 against issuance of equity shares of a subsidiary company, BBL, which represents 0.85% shareholding of BBL. The consideration was  received and equity shares were allotted on September 03, 2020.    During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Group had entered into an agreement with Beta Oryx Limited (‘Investor’) whereby the Investor has infused  Rs 5,550 against issuance of equity shares of a subsidiary company, BBL, which represents 1.87% shareholding of BBL. The consideration was received  and equity shares were allotted on March 09, 2021.    As per the above agreements , the Group will be required to provide various options to enable the Investor to exit over a period of time. In the event,  such exit events do not occur, the Investor may require the parent company (Biocon Limited), to buy them out at certain prices agreed under the  arrangement.  Such an obligation to provide exit to the Investors required the Group to record a financial liability towards gross obligation amounting to  Rs. 10,493 (March 31, 2024: Rs. 14,719) in the consolidated financial statements as at March 31, 2025, in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards  (Ind AS).    During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company purchased equity shares in its subsidiary, BBL,  from one of the above investors of the subsidiary  pursuant to liquidity option exercised under the shareholder’s agreement for Rs. 5,550. This has resulted in increase in Company’s equity holding in the  subsidiary effective from the date of purchase. Other investors have deferred their exit rights till March 31, 2026 and accordingly the Gross obligation has  been disclosed as Non-current liability in the consolidated financial statements considering that these rights are exercisable post March 31, 2026.   The Group in accordance with Ind AS has elected an accounting policy choice to follow an anticipated acquisition method on initial recognition which  requires recognition of a gross obligation liability with a corresponding derecognition of non-controlling interest balance in its consolidated financial  statements.  Further, in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles, the Group has made an accounting policy choice to present any  subsequent change in the fair value of gross obligation liability in other equity. The fair value of the gross obligation is computed using the underlying  share price of the unlisted subsidiary which is determined based on discounted cash flow approach and other factors. (ii)    During the previous year, BBL has issued 1,06,86,044 compulsory convertible debentures (“CCD”) to ESOF III Investment Fund and Edelweiss Alternative  Asset Advisors Limited , on private placement basis at an issue price of 280.74 amounts to Rs. 3,000.The CCD’s are issued for a tenor of 36 months, are  unsecured, redeemable at par and carry a conversion option at any time during the tenor at the option of the investor. CCD bears a coupon rate of 12%  per annum plus agreed variable coupon payable on compounded and cumulative basis only on redemption. The variable coupon is linked to the equity  share price of BBL. The CCD’s are convertible upon occurrence of conversion event at 1:1 ratio.    Under the above arrangement , the Group will be required to provide various options to enable the Investor to exit over a period of time.  In the event,  such exit events do not occur, the Investor may require the parent company (Biocon Limited), to buy them out at certain prices agreed under the  arrangement.  Such an obligation to provide exit to the Investors required the Group to record a financial liability towards gross obligation amounting  to Rs. 3,693 in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS). (iii)    The Group had acquired the biosimilar business from Viatris in November 2022 and under the definitive agreement, the Group had an obligation  to pay a deferred consideration of Rs. 28,619 (USD 335 million) to Viatris. The Group settled Rs. 20,930 (USD 245 million) in cash and the parties also  agreed  to offset the closing working capital target of Rs. 2,563 (USD 30 million), against the deferred cash consideration. The Group entered into a full  and final settlement agreement with Viatris, under which, Viatris has agreed to waive-off the remaining deferred consideration of Rs. 5,126 (USD 60  million) subject to certain conditions relating to royalty, profit shares, milestone payments in respect of a molecule, to be paid by the Group to one of its  collaboration partner as and when the product is commercialized and hence such amount has been disclosed under Other financial liabilities. (iv)    CCPS were fair valued using Binomial Option Pricing Model at Rs. 82,181. Each CCPS shall be convertible into equity shares of BBL at any time at the  option of the holder at a conversion rate of 1:1. BBL has an obligation to issue further equity shares to Mylan Inc, subject to maximum of 61,562,420  equity shares, such that the fair value of the equity holding in BBL post conversion is atleast USD 1,000 Mn. The issue of additional shares results in  contingent consideration. The CCPS on initial recognition has been bifurcated into equity component of Rs. 74,815 (fixed to fixed conversion) and  contingent consideration (derivative liability) of Rs. 7,366. At March 31, 2025, the fair value of contingent consideration is Rs. 8,970 (March 31, 2024: Rs.  7,426). 376 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited

Provisions Act, 1952 and based on Group’s evaluation, there are significant uncertainties and numerous interpretative issues relating to the judgement  and hence It is unclear as to whether the clarified definition of Basic Wages would be applicable prospectively or retrospectively. The amount of the obligation  therefore cannot be measured with sufficient reliability for past periods and hence has currently been considered to be a contingent liability in one of its  subsidiary. The Group is involved in taxation matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Judgment is required in assessing the range of  possible outcomes for some of these tax matters, which could change over time as each of the matter progresses depending on experience on actual  assessment proceedings by tax authorities and other judicial precedents.  Based on its internal assessment supported by external legal counsel views, if any,  the Group believes that it will be able to sustain its positions if challenged by the authorities and accordingly no additional provision is required for these  matters.   Other than the matter disclosed above, the Group is involved in disputes, lawsuits, proceedings etc. including patent and commercial matters that arise from  time to time in the ordinary course of business.  Management is of the view that above matters are not tenable and will not have any material adverse effect  on the Group’s financial position and results of operations. 33.

Employee benefit plans (i)   The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under this legislation, employee who has completed five years  of service is entitled to specific benefit. The level of benefits provided depends on the employee’s length of service and salary at retirement/termination  age and does not have any maximum monetary limit for payments. The gratuity plan is primarily a funded plan and the Group makes contributions to  a recognised fund in India.   The  plan assets  are  maintained  with  HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited (HDFC Life) in respect of gratuity scheme for employees of the Group.  The details of investments maintained by the HDFC Life are not available with the Group and not disclosed. The expected rate of return on plan assets  is 6.5% p.a. (March 31, 2024: 7.3% p.a.). The Group actively monitors how the duration and expected yield of the investments are matching the expected  outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations.   The cost of the defined benefit plans and other long term benefits are determined using actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations involve making various  assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These includes the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and  mortality rate. Due to these complexity involved in the valuation it is highly sensitive to the changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed  at reporting date. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost and planned service cost were measured using  the projected unit cost method.   Based on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the status of the gratuity plan and the amounts recognised in the  Group’s financial statements as at balance sheet date: Particulars Present value of  defined benefit  obligation Fair value of    plan assets Net defined  benefit (asset)/ liability Balance as on April 01, 2024  1,507   (8)  1,499  Current service cost  179    -     179  Interest expense / (income)  104   (1)  103  Amount recognised in Statement of profit and loss  283   (1)  282  Remeasurements: Return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in interest expense /  (income)   -      -      -    Actuarial (gain) / loss arising from:   Demographic assumptions  (20)   -     (20)   Financial assumptions  14    -     14    Experience adjustment  70    -     70  Amount recognised in other comprehensive income  64    -     64  Liabilities transferred out  (42)  (42) Benefits paid  (181)   -     (181) Balance as at March 31, 2025  1,631   (9)  1,622  395 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity and interest rate risk. (iii)   Sensitivity analysis   Sensitivity analysis is performed by varying a single parameter while keeping all the other parameters unchanged. Sensitivity analysis does not recognise  the interrelationship between underlying parameters. Hence, the results may vary if two or more variables are changed simultaneously. The method  used does not indicate anything about the likelihood of change in any parameter and the extent of the change if any. The sensitivity of the defined  benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions are as below: Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Discount rate (1% change)  (74)  82   (65)  72  Salary increase (1% change)  80   (74)  70   (65) Attrition rate (1% change)  (13)  14   (10)  11    Sensitivity of significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of defined benefit obligation by  one percentage, keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. Although, the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of the cash flows  expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown. 396 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited

An  increase in the life expectancy will increase the plan’s liability.   d)   Salary risk: Higher than expected increase in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.

(a)    The fair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other Current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to the carrying amounts of  these items due to their short – term nature (b)    There have been no transfers between level 1, 2 and 3 needs to be made. (c)    The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties. Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques in consultation  with market expert. The most frequently applied valuation technique include forward pricing, swap models and Black  Scholes Merton Model (for  options valuation), using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange forward rates, interest rate curve  and forward rates curve. B.    Measurement of fair values Fair value of liquid investments are based on quoted price. Derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities  in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the market place. Contingent consideration arising from business acquisition and Non- Convertible Debentures are valued based on option pricing models, as disclosed in note 36(C). Sensitivity analysis For the fair values of derivative contracts of foreign currencies and interest rates swaps, reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the  significant observable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have the following effects in other comprehensive income (OCI).

Financial risk management   The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:   - Credit risk   - Liquidity risk   - Market risk   (i)    Risk management framework     The Group’s risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board provides  written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk,  use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.   (ii)   Credit risk     Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to financial loss.  The credit risk arises principally from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with  banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments.     Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit  risk management. The Audit and Risk Management Committee of the respective Company’s has established a credit policy under which each new  customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The  Group’s review includes external ratings, where available, and other publicly available financial information. Outstanding customer receivables are  regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.     The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected credit loss in respect of trade and other receivables.  The maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to Rs. 54,879  (March 31, 2024: Rs. 62,306). The  movement in allowance for credit loss in respect of trade and other receivables during the year was as follows: Allowance for credit loss March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Opening balance  646   617  Allowance for credit loss recognised / (reversed)  (19)  29  Closing balance  627   646      Refer note 11 for details of aging of trade receivables and allowance for credit losses. 400 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 (All amounts are in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data, unless otherwise stated) 36. Financial instruments: Fair value and risk managements (continued...)      Trade receivables including unbilled revenue from two individual customers is Rs. 11,428 (March 31, 2024 - Nil) which is individually more than 10  percent of the Group’s trade receivables including unbilled revenue.     Credit risk on cash and cash equivalent and derivatives is limited as the Group generally transacts with banks and financial institutions with  high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies which are rated  A1+ or AAA . Investments primarily include  investment in liquid mutual fund units, bonds and non-convertible debentures. (iii)    Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by  delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity  to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the  Group’s reputation.   As stated in note 48 (d), the Group believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is  perceived. In addition, the Group maintains lines of credit as stated in note 14 and note 19.   The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities and excluding interest payments. The tables have been drawn up based on the  undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay:   March 31, 2025 Particulars Less than 1 year 1 - 2 years 2-5 years More than 5 years Total Borrowings [refer note b]  53,498   25,506   98,551    -     177,555  Trade payables  65,487    -      -      -     65,487  Lease liabilities  797   852   2,345   5,340   9,334  Derivative liabilities  455   232    -      -     687  Other financial liabilities [refer  note a]  9,326   28,282    -      -     37,608  Total  129,563   54,872   100,896   5,340   290,671    March 31, 2024 Particulars Less than 1 year 1 - 2 years 2-5 years More than 5 years Total Borrowings [refer note b]  25,528   8,293   123,475    -     157,296  Trade payables  62,720    -      -      -     62,720  Lease liabilities  868   689   1,678   2,797   6,032  Derivative liabilities  12    -      -      -     12  Other financial liabilities [refer  note a]  50,005    -     10,725    -     60,730  Total  139,133   8,982   135,878   2,797   286,790    (a)    Other financial liabilities includes amounts payable towards Gross obligation liability, refer note 16.   (b)   Borrowings include non-convertible debentures amounting to Rs. 20,913 (March 31, 2024: Rs. 18,324) related to agreements with the lenders  containing certain put options fully described in note 14 to these financial statements. (iv)   Market risk   Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign  exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices.    Foreign currency risk   The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently, the Group is exposed to  foreign exchange risk through operating and borrowing activities in foreign currency. The Group holds derivative instruments such as foreign exchange  forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates and foreign currency exposure. 401 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk   The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. During  the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were mainly denominated in USD.   (a)    Interest rate risk exposure     The exposure of the Group’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows: Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Variable rate borrowings  78,222   126,349  Fixed rate borrowings  99,333   30,947  Total borrowings  177,555   157,296    (b)    Sensitivity     The Group policy is to maintain a optimum balance between fixed and variable rate borrowings using interest rate swaps to achieve this when  necessary. The Group is therefore subject to interest rate risk as defined under Ind AS 107.     A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates for variable rate borrowings at the reporting date would have increased/  (decreased) equity and profit or loss by Rs. 782 (March 31, 2024 : Rs. 1,263)   Net Investment hedges   A foreign currency exposure arises from the Group’s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries that have a USD functional currency. The risk arises from  the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the USD and the INR, which causes the amount of the net investment to vary.   The hedged risk in the net investment hedge is the risk of a weakening USD against the INR that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of the  Group’s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries.   During the previous year, the Group designated a USD denominated loan as a hedging instrument to hedge its net investment in foreign operation of  its foreign subsidiaries, which mitigates the foreign currency risk arising from the subsidiary’s net assets. During the current year, the USD denominated  loan has been repaid.   To assess hedge effectiveness, the Group determines the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item by comparing  changes in the carrying amount of the debt that is attributable to a change in the spot rate with changes in the investment in the foreign operation due  to movements in the spot rate (the offset method). The Group’s policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal. 403 Statutory Reports Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025

Capital management The key objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity to uphold investor,  creditor, and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its business. The Group focused on keeping strong total equity base to ensure  independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the Group. The Company’s goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual dividends in future periods. The amount of future dividends of equity shares will be balanced with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status. The capital structure as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 was as follows: Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Total equity attributable to owners of the Company  216,440   197,837  As a percentage of total capital 55% 56% Long-term borrowings  124,054   129,324  Short-term borrowings  53,501   27,972  Total borrowings  177,555   157,296  Debt-equity ratio 45% 44% Total capital (Equity and Borrowings)  393,995   355,133  404 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited

Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 (All amounts are in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data, unless otherwise stated) 43   Goodwill Goodwill arising upon business combination is not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash  generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired. Particulars March 31, 2025 March 31, 2024 Opening Balance  163,460   161,098  Goodwill arising on business combination   -     69  Other adjustments   -      -    - Foreign currency translation adjustment  4,133   2,293  Closing Balance  167,593   163,460  “For the purposes of impairment assessment, the Group is considered as single Cash generating unit. The recoverable amount of the above cash generating  units have been determined using a value-in-use model. Value-in-use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows  plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows. Key  assumptions upon which the Group has based its determinations of value-in-use include: a)   Estimated cash flows for ten years, based on management’s projections. b)   A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using growth rate ranging from 1% to 3%. This long-term  growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the  relevant business and industry sector. c)   The post tax discount rate used is 14% based on the BBL’s weighted average cost of capital.”     The Group believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate  carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.     44.

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?      At Biocon, the process of identifying and assessing work-related hazards is a structured and continuous effort, encompassing both routine and  non-routine operations. The overall risk management framework is typically divided into four key stages:     1.   Risk Identification & Assessment       Biocon proactively identifies risks related to occupational health, operations, and environment, including both routine and non-routine  activities (e.g., shutdowns, maintenance). Tools such as Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) are  deployed to detect potential hazards at both process and task levels.    2.   Risk  Prioritization         Risks are prioritized using a standardized risk matrix based on severity and likelihood. The Management of Change (MOC) framework ensures  risks from changes in equipment, processes, or materials are systematically reviewed and addressed.     3.    Risk Mitigation         Biocon implements structured mitigation measures including engineering controls, PPE protocols, administrative safeguards, and procedure  revisions. For high-risk and non-routine operations, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are mandatory. Behaviour-Based Safety (BBS) programs  promote a safety-first culture and reduce incidents stemming from human error.     4.    Monitoring & Reporting         Risk control effectiveness is tracked via internal/external safety audits, incident reporting systems, and dashboard-based monitoring. Insights  are regularly reviewed by senior management to strengthen governance and enhance workplace safety outcomes.   c.   Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)     Yes, Biocon has well-established mechanisms that allow both employees and contract workers to promptly report work-related hazards and  withdraw from unsafe situations without fear of retaliation. These include regular safety committee meetings, departmental Toolbox Talks, and  structured engagement with line managers and worker representatives to address health and safety concerns through defined Corrective and  Preventive Actions (CAPA).     To enhance transparency and responsiveness, Biocon (Bengaluru sites) has implemented  BiopathZero , a digital safety platform that captures real- time data on near-miss incidents, unsafe acts/conditions, and Gemba walk observations. This system enables timely interventions and supports a  prevention-focused, data-driven safety culture across all operations, including third-party contract workers.   d.   Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)       Yes. Biocon ensures holistic employee well-being through 24/7 Occupational Health Centres (OHCs) at its facilities, staffed by qualified medical  professionals. These centres address both occupational and general health needs. 11.

There were no significant safety-related incidents requiring extensive corrective measures during the reporting period. However, potential work-related  risks identified through routine safety inspections are systematically addressed through structured safety management practices. The company adopts  a comprehensive suite of safety systems to proactively identify, assess, and control occupational health and safety risks include:    Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): for systematic recognition and prioritization of workplace hazards.   •   Job Safety Analysis (JSA): to evaluate job-specific risks and implement control measures before task execution.   Behaviour-Based Safety (BBS): to reinforce a culture of safe behaviors through observation, engagement, and feedback.   Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR): to verify that all safety protocols and controls are in place and functioning effectively before commissioning new or  modified equipment and processes.   Safety Management System (SMS): to provide an integrated framework encompassing safety policies, procedures, performance monitoring, and  continuous improvement.   These systems enableto identify opportunities to prevent incidents, reduce occupational illnesses, and mitigate workplace hazards. Employee  competency is regularly assessed to ensure all personnel receive appropriate training in HIRA, JSA, SOPs, and other safety  procedures relevant to  their roles. For risks evaluated as unacceptable, specific remedial measures are defined and implemented. These include corrective action plans and  engineering, or administrative controls designed to enhance workplace safety and maintain regulatory compliance. Leadership Indicators   1.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details   Biocon Limited has undertaken a range of focused initiatives to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across various sites and operations. These  efforts are aligned with our sustainability goals and contribute to mitigating climate change impacts.   Key GHG reduction projects implemented during the reporting period:   1.     Biocon Limited transitioned to 99% renewable energy sourcing for its operations at Site-1 and Site-2 in Bangalore. This shift has resulted in zero  Scope 2 emissions from electricity consumption at these facilities.   2.     Optimization of Air Handling Unit (AHU) and Cold room operating hours at Site-6, based on actual manufacturing needs, led to energy savings of    3,05,136 kWh and an estimated reduction of approximately 221.83 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e).    3.     Steam optimization measures including AHU steam optimization, steam condensate recovery, boiler steam pressure optimization, and steam  trap uptime improvement, were implemented at Site 6. These initiatives resulted in fuel savings of 234 tons of coal and a reduction of 561 tCO₂e  emissions.   4.     The 70TR chilled brine plant at Site-3 was upgraded by replacing carbon steel oil coolers with efficient copper tube oil coolers. This resulted in a  saving of 189,000 kWh and a reduction of 137 tCO₂e.   5.     A PLC-based HMI system was introduced for the 400TR water chilling plant at Site-3 to optimize operating hours and power usage. The project  yielded 324,000 kWh in energy savings and 235 tCO₂e in emission reductions.   6.     Automatic temperature-based control systems were installed for cooling tower fans at Site-3, enabling optimized operations. This initiative saved  48,000 kWh of electricity and avoided approximately 35 tCO₂e.   7.     Compressed air lines were interconnected, replacing the operation of multiple air compressors at Site 3. This resulted in an energy saving of 36,000  kWh and a reduction of 26 tCO₂e emissions.   8.     Reverse osmosis (RO) systems were implemented to reduce the feed volume to Multiple Effect Evaporators (MEE), resulting in the conservation of  2,74,995 standard cubic meters (SCM) of fuel and 1,36,513 kWh resulting in a GHG  reduction of 662 tCO₂e.   9.     A heat pump was installed for pre-heating boiler feedwater, replacing traditional fuel-based heating methods. This measure saved 1,93,646 SCM of  gas and avoided 396 tCO₂e in emissions.   10.     Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) were deployed for motors operating pumps, fans, and blowers across various facilities. This helped save 6,18,104  kWh and reduced GHG emissions by 449 tCO₂e.   11.     Energy-efficient Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) fans were installed in cooling towers, resulting in 3,47,107 kWh of electricity savings and a GHG  reduction of 252 tCO₂e.   12.

These measures  resulted in an energy saving of 204,257 kWh and a reduction of 150 tCO₂e emissions. 47 Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

  13.     Auto tube cleaning for chiller condensers, steam turbine for power generation, and pump efficiency improvements in effluent treatment were  implemented at Site 2. These initiatives resulted in an energy saving of 3,27,796 kWh and a reduction of 238 tCO₂e emissions.   14.     A hydro-turbine was implemented at Site 1, utilizing the kinetic energy of return water to rotate the cooling tower fan, eliminating the need for a  motor. This resulted in an energy saving of 52,392 kWh and a reduction of 38 tCO₂e emissions   15.   Biocon has also made significant progress in reducing Scope-1 emissions by replacing fossil fuels with biomass briquettes for steam generation:     At Site-2, this transition avoided 84,85,300 SCM of fossil fuel use and reduced emissions by 17,356 tCO₂e.     At Site-3, 1,797 SCM Tons of fossil fuel was avoided, leading to a reduction of 2,399 4,313 tCO₂e.      These projects collectively demonstrate Biocon’s ongoing commitment to environmental responsibility, energy efficiency, and carbon footprint  reduction in alignment 9.

Section 149(11) provides that an independent director  may hold office for up to 2 (two) consecutive terms. Naina Lal Kidwai (DIN: 00017806) was appointed as an Independent Director  of the Company with the approval of shareholders at the Annual General  Meeting of the Company held on July 28, 2022, for a term commencing  from the date of Board’s approval i.e. April 28, 2022 till the conclusion of 47th  AGM of the Company to be held in the year 2025. Accordingly, her first term  as an Independent Director shall end at the conclusion of the ensuing 47th  AGM of the Company i.e. on August 08, 2025. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee, on the basis of performance  evaluation of Independent Directors, has recommended re-appointment of  Naina Lal Kidwai as an Independent Director for a second term of 5 (five)  consecutive years from the date of the 47th AGM of the Company i.e. from  August 08, 2025 till August 07, 2030. The Board, based on the performance evaluation of Independent Directors  and as per the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee, considers that, given the background, experience and  contributions made by Naina Lal Kidwai during her tenure, her continued  association would be of immense benefit to the Company and it is desirable  to continue to avail her services as an Independent Director. Further, Naina  Lal Kidwai possesses the integrity, expertise, experience for re-appointment  as an Independent Director and is a person of high integrity and repute.

Save and except Naina Lal Kidwai and her relatives, none of the other  Director(s) and Key Managerial Personnel(s) or their relatives, are in any way,  concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, in this resolution. Item No. 5: To approve the payment of remuneration to  Directors in case of absence / inadequate profits. The shareholders through Postal Ballot Notice dated December 19, 2022,  approved that in the event of absence or inadequacy of profits in any of the  3 (three) years commencing from Financial Year 2022-23, the remuneration  as approved by the Members at the 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM)  of the Company held on July 24, 2020, 43rd AGM held on July 23, 2021 and  by the Board of Directors from time to time be continued to be paid to the  Executive Directors, Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors as  minimum remuneration. The shareholders at the 43rd AGM on July 23, 2021 approved payment  of remuneration to Non-Executive Directors (including Independent  Directors) upto 3% of the net profits of the Company. The payment of such  remuneration shall be in addition to the sitting fees for attending Board/ Committee meetings. This remuneration will be distributed amongst all or  some of the Directors in accordance with the directions given by the Board  of Directors and subject to any other applicable requirements under the  Act. The shareholders at the 46th AGM of the Company, held on August  09, 2024 approved the re-appointment of Kiran Mazumdar Shaw as an  Executive Director, designated as Executive Chairperson for a period of 5  (five) years commencing from April 1, 2025, on such terms and conditions  including remuneration as set out in the explanatory statement annexed to  the 46th AGM Notice. The shareholders at the said AGM also approved re- appointment of Siddharth Mittal as Managing Director of the Company for a  014 Accelerating Reach Biocon Limited 

period of 5 (five) years effective from December 1, 2024, on such terms and  conditions including remuneration as set out in the explanatory statement  annexed to the 46th AGM Notice. The shareholders further approved that, the terms and conditions of  appointment of Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and Siddharth Mittal, including  remuneration and annual incremental thereof, can be altered and varied,  but such remuneration shall not exceed the limits specified in the Act and  / or as specifically approved by the Members of the Company pursuant to  Section 197 of the Act read with Schedule V. The shareholders further approved payment of remuneration to Siddharth  Mittal in excess of prescribed limit of 5% of the net profits of the Company  computed in accordance with Section 198 of the Act, in any financial year(s),  during his tenure as the Managing Director of the Company provided,  however, that the total managerial remuneration payable to the executive  director(s) of the Company taken together in any financial year shall not  exceed the limit of 10% of net profit and overall managerial remuneration  payable to all directors shall not exceed the limit of 11% of net profit of the  Company as prescribed under Section 197 of the Act read with rules made  thereunder or other applicable provisions or any statutory modifications  thereof, unless specifically approved by the Members of the Company  pursuant to Section 197 of the Act read with Schedule V. In the event of loss or inadequacy of profits in any financial year during  the tenure of service of the Chairperson and the Managing Director, the  payment of remuneration shall be governed by the limits prescribed under  Section 197 of the Act read with Part II of Schedule V to the Act as specifically  approved by the Members of the Company. The Company’s business operations related to the sale of generic  formulations are recorded in a wholly owned subsidiary, while the sale  of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) from a manufacturing facility  in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh is recorded in another wholly owned  subsidiary. As a result, a portion of the sales and corresponding profitability  from the generics segment is reflected in the financials of these subsidiaries,  leading to comparatively lower profitability in the Company’s standalone  financial statements. Additionally, the Company has funding commitments in Biocon Biologics  Limited (BBL), subsidiary of the Company and, as one of the funding options,  has issued Non-Convertible Debentures and Commercial Papers to various  investors. The interest costs associated with these borrowings are recorded  in the Company’s books, which also impacts standalone profitability due to  applicable accounting treatments. Despite these factors, the standalone business of the Company is expected  to generate adequate cash flows to meet its obligations, including  payment of remuneration to Directors. However, the transfer of a portion  of the generics business profitability to subsidiaries and the interest costs  from debt raised for subsidiary-related commitments have affected the  Company’s net profits in the current financial year and may continue to do  so in the near future. In such situation the remuneration payable to directors is likely to exceed (i)  the limit of 3% of the net profits of the Company, being maximum limit of  remuneration payable to Non-Executive Directors (including Independent  Directors), (ii) 5% of the net profits of the Company, being maximum limit  of remuneration payable individually to Managing Director or Whole-time  Director, (iii) limit of 10% of the net profits of the company, being maximum  limit of managerial remuneration payable to all the Executive Directors of  the Company in a financial year as well as the (iv) limit of 11% of the net  profits of the company, being the overall remuneration payable to all the  Directors of the Company in a financial year as prescribed under Section  197 of the Act. As per Schedule V of the Act, where in any financial year during the tenure of  a managerial person, or other director, a company has no profits or its profits  are inadequate, it may, pay remuneration to the managerial person or other  director in excess of the limits prescribed under Section 197 and Schedule V  if the resolution passed by the shareholders is a special resolution. Accordingly, as an abundant caution, approval of the shareholders is being  sought for payment of remuneration to the Directors (including Executive,  Non-Executive & Independent Directors), in situation of absence or  inadequacy of profits for 3 (three) years w.e.f. Financial Year 2025-26. Further, pursuant to Regulation 17(6)(e) of SEBI Listing Regulations, the fees or  compensation payable to executive directors who are promoters or members  of the promoter group, shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders by  Special resolution in general meeting, if (i) the annual remuneration payable  to such executive director exceeds Rupees 5 (five) crore or 2.5 (two and half)  per cent of the net profits of the listed entity, whichever is higher; or (ii) where  there is more than one such director, the aggregate annual remuneration to  such directors exceeds 5 (five) per cent of the net profits of the listed entity.  The Members’ approval obtained for re-appointment of Kiran Mazumdar- Shaw at the 46th AGM of the Company held on August 09, 2024 already  covered the above approval by way of a Special Resolution till the expiry of  her term. Accordingly, the Special Resolution, being proposed, would also be  in compliance with the aforesaid requirements of SEBI Listing Regulations, in  case it becomes applicable for any subsequent financial years till her term as  an Executive Chairperson, pursuant to increase, if any, in the remuneration of  Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw. Further, Section II Part II of Schedule V of the Act requires disclosure of  certain information to be made in the explanatory statement of the Notice  calling the general meeting seeking approval of the Members for payment  of remuneration by companies having no or inadequate profits. The said  disclosures form part of this Notice as “ Annexure 2 ”. The proposed resolution is envisaged to pay remuneration in the event of  inadequate / no profits. However, there will be no change in remuneration  of Directors in absolute amount other than annual salary increments as  stated in Annexure 2. The Board of Directors of the Company, on the recommendation of the  Nomination and Remuneration Committee, at their meeting held on  May 08, 2025 approved and recommended payment of remuneration to  Directors in situation of absence or inadequacy of profits, on the same  terms and conditions of appointment and remuneration as approved by  the Members / Board of Directors of the Company by considering such  remuneration to be the minimum remuneration payable to the Directors  during the 3 (three) years commencing from Financial Year 2025-26. It is hereby confirmed that the Company has not committed any default  in respect of any of its debts or interest payable thereon to any bank or  public financial institution or non-convertible debenture holders or any  other secured creditor. Accordingly, the Board, recommends the resolution as set out at Item No.  5 of this Notice for approval of the Members of the Company as a Special  Resolution. All the Directors of the Company & their relatives (including Executive, Non- Executive & Independent Directors) may be deemed to be concerned or  015 Biocon Limited Integrated Annual Report  FY 2025 

interested in the proposed Resolution in so far as it relates to the Directors’  own remuneration. Except as stated above, none of the Directors or Key Managerial Personnel  of the Company either directly or through their relatives are, in any way,  concerned or interested, whether financially or otherwise, in the proposed  Resolution.
