ADANI POWER LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 India’s power  demand is being propelled to newer peaks by its  fast-growing economy.  Thermal power is yet again in the spotlight as  the backbone of India’s energy strategy, given  its criticality for providing base load and peak  power supply and balancing the grid. The nation  requires an additional 80+ GW of thermal power  by FY 2031-32 to ensure reliable, uninterrupted  power. And this must be done fast and decisively. While the public sector undertakings play their  part, it is private leaders like ourselves who are  stepping up to bridge the energy gap. At Adani Power, we are taking a leadership role,  planning to commit one of the largest capex  investments to support India’s growing power  needs and economic ambitions. Alongside this,  we are redefining what is possible to build a  high-performance energy ecosystem – one  that is smarter, more efficient and resilient.  We continue to strengthen our operational  muscle, pushing the limits of efficiency through  our sector-leading fuel sourcing and logistics  capabilities, remunerative long-term PPAs, and  robust liquidity. With proactive risk management –  across operations, project execution, and finance  – we have reinforced our ability to navigate likely  disruptions, while delivering steady performance  and advancing strategic objectives. At Adani Power, we are using our strengths to  shape India’s energy future – delivering reliable,  cost-effective and sustainable power for all, and  our resilience to surmount any challenge on the  way. Our efforts will power not just households  and businesses, but also the aspirations of    1.4 billion Indians and drive forward the nation’s  progress and prospects. From rapid electrification and production-linked  incentives to rising household consumption and the  surge in e-mobility, multiple forces are driving India’s  power demand. Peak power demand is thus estimated to  surge to 296 GW by FY 2026-27 and 388 GW by    FY 2031-32, as compared to 250 GW in May 2024. 20

We added 2,300 MW capacity  in FY 2024-25 through acquisition, reviving  stressed assets with our expertise to ensure they  sustain uninterrupted power supplies. We will  add another 13,120 MW capacity by FY 2030-31,  targeting ~15% of India’s incremental thermal  power capacity requirements. Together,    this will take our operational capacity to    30,670 MW, critical for meeting growing power  demand and grid stabilisation for greater  renewable integration. Unparalleled  B enchmarks in  S peed    and  E fficiency We aim to redefine execution benchmarks,  targeting to complete the projects faster than  industry standards in a record timeframe for  the nation. Our strategic pre-ordering of critical  equipment at competitive prices, coupled with  in-house project management and logistics and  fuel advantage, positions us for agile execution  with the lowest Capex and Opex.  Financial  P rudence for    S ustainable  G rowth  Adding capacity is one thing – adding it with  financial discipline is what will set us apart.  We will fund our expansion primarily using  internal accruals, reducing dependence on    debt, cutting interest outflows and maintaining  financial agility. This disciplined approach not  just strengthens our balance sheet, but it also  provides greater bandwidth to capitalise on  emerging opportunities. Bold  S teps to  R esponsible     E nergy  L eadership Scale without responsibility is unsustainable.  That is why, 95% of all our upcoming capacities  are being based on ultra-supercritical/ supercritical technologies, which are highly  efficient and have low GHG emission intensity. 21 

MESSAGE FROM    THE CHAIRMAN We have become –    more formidable,  more unbreakable,  more stronger and  more resilient! - GAUTAM ADANI ADANI POWER LIMITED 22 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

Our objectives are aligned with India’s ambitions.  And   our strength comes from the belief that you –  our   shareholders – place in us. Dear Stakeholders, Let me begin with a salute and a bow of gratitude as a  fellow citizen who deeply acknowledges the courage of  our brothers and sisters that guard our peace. During Operation Sindoor, our brave men and women  in uniform stood tall, not for recognition, but for duty.  Times like these make us realise that peace cannot  be taken for granted. It is earned through decades of  silent sacrifice, unwavering resolve and strength built  far from the spotlight, in the deserts, on the borders  and deep at sea. Our achievements as a nation do not just lie in balance  sheets or boardrooms but also belong to the soldiers  who stand watch while we build, and to the uniform  that chooses service while we chase ambition. It is with this humbling sense of purpose that I write  to you today. In 2024-25, the Adani Group delivered  yet another year of significant growth. Growth built  on the bedrock of your unwavering trust, and a belief  in the long arc of transformation. And we have not  grown in calm seas. We have grown in the middle of  global turbulence. Over 60 nations have gone to the polls, redrawing  maps, rewriting alliances. Conflicts in the Middle  East have disrupted energy flows and logistics  corridors. Europe, once an economic stronghold, now  grapples with stagnation and a search for identity in a  fractured world. In the midst of all this, our country stood apart. While prudence elsewhere buckled under pressure,  India surged forward as a beacon of stability, of  growth amidst uncertainty and of confidence  amidst confusion. Yes, we have the wind at our back, a demographic  dividend, a booming digital economy and infrastructure  built at record pace. But make no mistake, this  momentum did not happen by chance. It is the result of vision. Of intent. Of policy with  purpose. I say this with full conviction that the Indian  Government, both at the Centre and across the states,  has laid down the foundation for a truly historic  transformation. A transformation not of a few, but for an  entire nation rising with ambition that declares - India’s  best chapters are just beginning. And together, we are  not just witnessing history. We are helping shape it. As a youngster, I saw my mother as my guiding star.  I recall her often saying: "ભાારતીીય સાામ્રાાજ્યોોનુંં� ભાાગ્ય  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં�  નું  હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ ક્યાા ર ેય  પ તીનું   પ ામ્ ય ા  નુંહી � , પણ  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં� હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ દ ર ેક પ તીનું  પછીી વધુ ં   શક્તિ� શ ાળીી અ નું ે અખં � ડ  સા� કલ્પ સાાથેે ફ ર ી ઊભાા રહ્યાં ા �."  Translated, it meant, "The future of India's empires was  not written by those who never accepted defeat, but by  those brave hearts who turned every fall into a stepping  stone - and each time rose again with stronger resolve  to change history." She would often tell me: “Gautam, history does not remember sailors who sailed  in calm waters; it remembers those who braved the  wildest storms and still returned home." And my dear shareholders, that is exactly what we  have done. Even in the face of fierce headwinds and relentless  scrutiny – we have never retreated. Instead – we have  recalibrated. We have reimagined. And we have become  – more formidable, more unbreakable, more stronger  and more resilient! People often ask me: “How does the Adani Group keep  doing it? How do we rise, time and again?” My answer remains the same: Our conviction is  anchored in clarity. Our objectives are aligned with  India’s ambitions. And our strength comes from the  belief that you – our shareholders – place in us. And all of this was tested last year, when we faced  allegations from the US Department of Justice and the  SEC relating to Adani Green Energy. Let me be clear: this was not the first time we have been  tested. Nor will it be the last. Every challenge sharpens  our resolve. Every setback becomes a stepping stone. Despite all the noise, the facts are that – no one from  the Adani Group has been charged with violating the  FCPA or conspiring to obstruct justice. We live in a  23 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

world where negativity often echoes louder than truth.  But as we cooperate with legal processes, let me also  restate - emphatically - our governance is of global  standards, and our compliance frameworks are robust  and non-negotiable. And while the numbers tell their own compelling story  – in a year of record-breaking revenue, unprecedented  growth and historic profitability – the deeper truth is  that these milestones are reflections of our relentless  strength and tenacity. They are proof of a Group that  dares to dream beyond constraints, powered by a nation  that breathes possibility into every tomorrow ahead  of us. Let me now talk about a few of the highlights of  FY   2024-25. Across all our sectors, we did more than  just scale – we created impact, inspired change, and  most importantly, deepened our national commitment. Adani Power crossed 100 billion units of power  generation, added 2.3 GW of conventional capacity,  funded  `   12,000+ crore in capex mainly through    internal accruals, and secured a 1,500 MW PPA in  Maharashtra. It is now well on track to reach 31 GW  capacity by 2030. Adani Green reached an operational renewable energy  capacity of over 14 GW and is on target to build the  world’s largest renewable energy plant of 30 GW at  Khavda and a total of 50 GW of renewables capacity  by 2030. Also, with over 5,000 MW of pumped  hydro storage targeted to be installed by 2030 and a  40-year 1,250 MW energy storage PPA with UPPCL,  we are setting global benchmarks in the space of  energy transition. Adani Energy Solutions had a huge year. It secured  `   43,990 crore in transmission orders and executed  `   13,600 crore worth of smart metering projects.  It retained its no. 1 DISCOM rank in India and became  the only private player with three national HVDC grid  links in its portfolio. Adani New Industries is aligned with the nation's  sustainability goals and has an order book for  construction of a 300 MW electrolyser plant. It also  launched an electrolyser testing lab at Mundra. It is  on track to expand its solar module manufacturing  lines and will have a 10 GW integrated solar  module manufacturing facility in place by the next  financial year. Adani Ports continued to strengthen its value  proposition as an Integrated Transport Utility with  unparalleled waterfront to customer gate capabilities.  Adani Ports handled an all-time high cargo volume of  450 MMT and achieved a 27% market share in India.  Adani Ports also continued to strengthen its logistics  network within the Indian hinterland across its diverse  range of assets including rakes, multi-modal logistics  parks, warehouses, agri silos and trucks, in addition  to starting freight forwarding services and a trucking  management platform. Adani Ports' marine division  also completed the successful acquisition of Astro  Offshore during the year and is set to deliver 3x growth  by FY   2026-27. Adani Natural Resources too had a very strong  year contributing to India's energy independence.  It produced a record 47 million tonnes of coal and  iron ore and is on track to achieve over 30% growth  by FY 2025-26. We also pioneered India’s first  hydrogen-powered mining truck as well as launched  an e-commerce platform that will soon enable  online trading of LPG, rock phosphate, copper and  precious metals. Also, in line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, Kutch  Copper has successfully produced its first copper anode  at Mundra thereby marking a strategic move in India’s  capability to meet the surging demand for energy  transition materials. Two and a half years ago, when we acquired  Holcim’s India cement business, we had made a bold  commitment: to double our capacity to 140 MTPA by  FY 2027-28. Today, I am proud to share that we have  already achieved 72% of that target and crossed the  100 MTPA milestone, becoming the ninth-largest  cement company globally. Adani Airports also had a record year of growth.  It launched Aviio – India’s first unified airport operations  app as well as reinforced its position as the country’s  fastest-growing airport operator. We handled a record  94 million passengers in FY 2024-25, registering a  7% growth. We also completed the first test flight at  the greenfield Navi Mumbai Airport, which will open  later this year with an initial passenger capacity of  20   million of what will eventually become a 90 million  passenger airport. When it comes to Adani Defence, we now stand at  the dawn of a new era. Our world-class ammunition  and missile capabilities in Kanpur is a vision to forge  one of South Asia's most formidable complexes.  When Operation Sindoor called, we delivered.  Our surveillance drones became the eyes in the skies,  our kamikaze drones became the swift swords of  attack, and our anti-drone systems became the shield  to help protect our forces and citizens. Every innovation  we make and every system we build is a salute to  ADANI POWER LIMITED 24 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

the courage of our Armed Forces. This is the spirit of  Atmanirbharta. This is the future we are grateful to have  an opportunity to help build. And the same applies to building Data Centers that  India needs to stay competitive in the technology  space. With the surge in AI, AdaniConneX is scaling fast.  We have projects exceeding 210 MW in various stages of  construction in partnership with the global hyperscalers  and have launched a giga-scale renewable-powered data  center campus in Navi Mumbai. Continuing the path of sustainability, Adani Total  Gas is playing a defining role in India’s clean energy  transition. As of this year, we serve close to 1 million PNG  customers and operate 647 CNG stations. Our roadmap  is to double both by 2030. Our e-mobility footprint  now spans 22 states and 4 union territories, with over  3,400 EV charging points installed, thereby positioning  us at the forefront of India’s evolving sustainable  energy ecosystem. But perhaps our most transformative project is unfolding  in Dharavi - Asia’s largest slum, now being reimagined  as India’s most ambitious urban rehabilitation project.  Over 1 million people will move from narrow lanes to  sunlit, modern homes. Inspired by Singapore’s housing  model and co-designed with global experts, the township  will feature spacious layouts, dual toilets, open spaces,  schools, hospitals, transit hubs and parks. Our Dharavi Social Mission is uplifting youth through  skilling, healthcare and employment programmes. A new  multi-modal mobility hub, amphitheatre, cloud kitchens  and riverfront are being planned to serve all of Mumbai. In terms of consolidated numbers, at the Group level,  revenues grew by 7%, EBITDA by 8.2%, and our Net  Debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained healthy at 2.6x. But, as I have stated in the past, our objective is  not to just build businesses - it is to create new  possibilities. Not just to serve markets - but to serve  our nation’s destiny. And in this context, our capital  investment across businesses is set to break all  records. We anticipate an annual CAPEX spend of  USD 15-20 billion for the next 5 years. These are  not just investments in our Group, but investments  in the possibilities for doing our part to build  India’s infrastructure. Before I start wrapping up, let me outline some of the  programmes that have me the most excited about. Exactly three years ago, on my 60 th  birthday,  my family pledged  `   60,000 crore to redefine  healthcare, education, and skill development in India.  The Adani Healthcare Temples are our first major  step – world-class, affordable 1,000-bed campuses  in Ahmedabad and Mumbai with medical colleges,  research centres and wellness spaces all integrated  together. Mayo Clinic is our partner in guiding us  to create a future-ready, AI-powered, patient-first  healthcare ecosystem. In parallel, we have committed  `  2,000 crore to build  a world-class skill university and finishing school in  Mundra, designed to empower youth from across India.  Through Schools of Excellence, global certifications  and partnerships with leaders like ITEES Singapore and  IGCC, we aim to create an industry-ready workforce.  This is more than philanthropy – it is our promise to  India because we believe that we are building not just  institutions, but legacies of transformation. And finally, let me end by talking about our participation  at the Maha Kumbh Mela. Over 650 million people  came together, not as strangers, but as one soul.  One purpose. One heartbeat. Along with ISKCON, the  Adani Group initiated the Mahaprasad Seva, offering  free meals to lakhs of devotees. More than 5,000 of our  employees volunteered wholeheartedly, reflecting the  values we cherish. With my family, I had the honour of performing the  sacred Ganga Aarti at the Triveni Sangam – and for  the Adani Group to be part of this was one of the  most moving days of my life. For me, the Maha Kumbh  is not just a festival. It is India’s soul on display – a  living testimony to our resilience, our unity and our  unwavering faith. And we were grateful to have had the  opportunity to perform seva at this year's Maha Kumbh. Let me conclude by saying that history should  remember us not for the size of our balance sheet,  but for the strength of our backbone. Not just for the  markets we entered, but for the storms we handled and  emerged stronger. For it is easy to lead in sunshine, but  true leadership is forged in the face of crisis. Strength is not just power – it is purpose, clarity and the  will to rise. And resilience is not endurance alone – it is  reinvention in the face of adversity. When combined, it  helps us do our part for building an India that refuses to  bend, refuses to break and never stops believing in its  own future. That is our truth. That is our legacy. That is our promise. The greatest chapters of our story are still ahead.  Thank you for being on this journey with us. Jai Hind. 25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

- ANIL SARDANA Managing Director - S. B. KHYALIA Chief Executive Officer Our ambitious expansion  plan – from 17,550 MW  in FY 2024-25 to 30,670  MW by FY 2029-30, with  addition of 12,520 MW  capacity organically – will  be instrumental in meeting  the country’s power demand. We capitalised on our solid  foundation to consolidate  our market-leading position  and boldly stepped into the  next phase of growth with  ambitious expansion plans. Joint message from the  Managing Director and  Chief Executive Officer ADANI POWER LIMITED 26 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

Dear Stakeholders, Adani Power grew from strength to strength in  FY 2024-25, driven by a vibrant power market,  advantageously positioned assets, operating  excellence, as well as an agile and capable  team. We capitalised on our solid foundation  to consolidate our market-leading position and  boldly stepped into the next phase of growth with  ambitious expansion plans. We continued enhancing  our core strengths with robust values, principles,  and structured processes. These efforts reinforce  our long-term resilience and stability, ensuring we  remain well-equipped to meet India’s power needs  while delivering sustained value to stakeholders.  Powering India’s  G rowth  W ith  S trength  and  R esilience The Indian economy is expanding rapidly, fuelling  an ever-growing need for power. Production-linked  incentive schemes, growing household  electrification, and a surge in e-mobility are  propelling energy consumption to newer highs.  India’s peak power demand already surged from  203 GW in FY 2021-22 to 249 GW in FY 2023-24.  This momentum is not expected to subside anytime  soon, with peak demand estimated to reach 296 GW  by FY 2026-27 and 388 GW by FY 2031-32. While renewable energy continues to be in focus,  thermal power will remain indispensable in ensuring  base load stability, meeting peak power demand, and  providing balancing power supply to stabilise the  grid. Aligned with this, the government has proposed  an additional thermal power capacity requirement  of 80 GW by FY 2031-32 and the DISCOMs are  floating bids for long-term thermal power supply.  But the need would be to add new capacities, while  balancing growth with efficiency and minimal  environmental impact. At Adani Power, we are positioning ourselves to lead  this transformation. Our ambitious expansion plan  – from 17,550 MW in FY 2024-25 to 30,670 MW by  FY 2029-30, with addition of 12,520 MW capacity  organically – will be instrumental in meeting  the country’s power demand. More importantly,  all new organic additions would be based on  ultra-supercritical technology, which will ensure  high thermal efficiency and lower carbon emissions.  We have further strategically selected plant  locations and acquisitions that offer significant  advantages. Their proximity to critical infrastructure,  abundant land availability and fuel sources provide  us with a formidable competitive edge for    upcoming PPAs.  Excellence in  E xecution and  P erformance FY 2024-25 was a year of exceptional execution.  We expanded our total operating capacity by    2,300 MW through strategic acquisitions, including  two financially stressed assets under the Corporate  Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) – Coastal  Energen (amalgamated into Moxie Power Generation  Limited) with 1,200 MW operational capacity  and Lanco Amarkantak (renamed as Korba Power  Limited) with 600 MW operational capacity and  1,320 MW of unfinished expansion project. We also  acquired the 500 MW Adani Dahanu Thermal Power  Station through a business transfer agreement from  a sister company.  In addition to this, we have received a Letter of  Intent for the acquisition of the 600 MW Vidarbha  Industries Power Limited under CIRP. Leveraging our  deep sectoral expertise and seamless integration  capabilities, we will swiftly revive and enhance the  performance of these important assets. As for the  1,320 MW brownfield expansion at Korba, OEMs  and other contractors are being finalised to revive,  complete and transform it into a productive asset. In April 2025, Adani Power (Jharkhand) Limited,  the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,  was amalgamated into it under a Scheme of  Arrangement. This amalgamation will allow    greater scalability and flexibility, and improve  financial strength. We also initiated several brownfield expansion  projects. This includes the 1,600 MW USTPP project  at the Mahan Energen site, which is progressing as  per schedule, and two 1,600 MW USTCPP projects  at Raipur and Raigarh where construction has  India’s peak power demand already surged  from 203 GW in FY 2021-22 to 250 GW  in FY 2023-24. This momentum is not  expected to subside anytime soon, with  peak demand estimated to reach 296 GW  by FY 2026-27 and 388 GW by FY 2031-32. 27 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

commenced recently. We have already secured  long-term PPAs for 2.92 GW of our upcoming    organic capacity, safeguarding their long-term  revenue potential.  We have maintained excellent O&M availability  of 91% on average across our fleet, ensuring our  ability to despatch power on demand. Our strong  competitive position helped us post PLF of 71% with  generation crossing 102 billion units and power  despatch volume growing by 21% to 95.9 billion  units. Our ability to navigate challenges was evident  in Bangladesh, where we ensured stable operations  at the Godda power plant despite political  turbulence. This resilience, combined with our  strong operational strategy, has also strengthened  our financial position. Strengthening  F inancial  F oundation Expansion in capacities and excellence in plant  operations enabled us to effectively address surging  demand, both under PPAs and in the merchant  market. While we ensured that plants were fully  available to supply power under PPAs with good  merit order positions, merchant and short-term  market despatches surged by 47% to nearly    21 billion units, providing a healthy upside to  revenues and margins.  Recurring revenues grew by 11% to  `  56,473 crore.  Recurring EBITDA grew stronger by 15% to  `  21,575  crore, primarily due to higher recurring revenue and  lower fuel prices along with focus on operational  efficiency. Prior period revenue recognition declined  from  `  9,322 crore in FY 2023-24 to  `  2,433 crore  in FY 2024-25, following the successful resolution  of all major regulatory matters. This highlights the  growing contribution of core earnings, reaffirming  the robustness of our business model. Profit after  tax came in at  `  12,750 crore, which was higher in  the previous year due to higher one-time income and  deferred tax credit. Our sustained performance and solid financial  foundation are a result of our prudent capital  management. With cash and cash equivalent of  `  7,312 crore as on March 31, 2025, our liquidity  position remains healthy. We have judiciously utilised  our cash flows to fund our capex and maintained  a low leverage. We have judiciously utilised our  cash flows to fund our capex and maintained a low  leverage. Strict control over finance costs resulted in  a decline of 1.4% to  `  3,340 crore in FY 2024-25.  These measures have contributed to upgrades in    our credit rating. Both CRISIL and India Ratings    have improved rating from AA- to AA, while CARE  Ratings and ICRA rated us AA at the initiation    stage. This marks 10 notches improvements in our  credit rating since 2018, highlighting our healthy  business risk profile, diversified operating portfolio,  growth in revenues and profits, and strengthened  financial position. Stepping  U p for  T omorrow  As we prepare for a period of accelerated growth  in India’s energy landscape, our focus remains on  flawless execution to translate our vision into  impactful action and enhanced market leadership.  Our diverse capabilities and financial resilience  provide a solid foundation in this quest. We aim to  employ the robust cash flows from our operations to  fund projects and reduce reliance on external debt.  This debt-light approach will lower our financial  risk and interest costs while giving us flexibility to  address emerging opportunities in the power market. To ensure timely execution, we have proactively  placed advance orders for boiler, turbine and  generators (BTG) for the entire 11.2 GW of targeted  organic capacity expansion, securing the most  critical part of the project supply chain. Orders for  balance-of-plant, civil work, etc. are being awarded  in phases to maintain a streamlined rollout. `  12,750 crore Profit after tax `  21,575 crore  Recurring EBITDA We have maintained excellent O&M  availability of 91% on average across  our fleet, ensuring our ability to  despatch power on demand.

Our  A pproach to  M ateriality   A ssessment In FY 2023-24, we conducted a double materiality  assessment and revisited it in FY 2024-25.  Our annual review of the materiality assessment  helps ensure that our material topics align with  the evolving ESG landscape. As a part of this  comprehensive exercise, we interacted with  key internal and external stakeholder groups,  including investors, shareholders, customers,  community members, academia, regulators,  and media. The assessment was conducted  in accordance with the GRI 3: Material Topics  2021 Standards and European Sustainability  Reporting Standards (ESRS) General Disclosures.  The double materiality assessment considered  two dimensions – impact materiality and financial  materiality. Compared to the previous materiality  assessment, we have added and retained critical  topics such as Digitalisation, Data Privacy and  Information Security, Employee Development  and Talent Retention, Labour Practices, Diversity,  Equity, and Inclusion, Supply Chain Management,  and Lifecycle Management of Assets. Identifying and  P rioritising  M atters    of  I mportance  Our double materiality assessment covers the  corporate office, thermal and solar plants, and  subsidiaries. There has been no change in our  operational scope or boundary compared to the  previous reporting period. To assess impact materiality, we evaluated our  organisation’s context, business operations,  sector, and business relationships to determine  our actual and potential impacts on the economy,  environment, and people. These impacts were  categorised based on their nature – positive  or negative, reversible or irreversible, intended  or unintended, and short-term or long-term.  These impacts were further assessed to establish  their significance and prioritise them based  on severity (scale, scope, and irremediable  character) and the likelihood of occurrence.  We identified risks and opportunities  linked to these impacts and assessed  their potential effects on Adani Power’s  financial performance and position over  the short, medium, or long term. Our senior  leadership assessed these impacts to  determine the financial implications  based on the likelihood of occurrence and  potential financial effects of associated  risks and opportunities. 63 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

For financial materiality, we identified risks  and opportunities linked to these impacts  and assessed their potential effects on Adani  Power’s financial performance and position  over the short, medium, or long term. Our senior  leadership assessed these impacts to determine  the financial implications based on the likelihood  of occurrence and potential financial effects of  associated risks and opportunities.  The next step in the assessment process involved  gathering inputs from identified stakeholders  through a materiality assessment questionnaire.  The responses to the questionnaire were  analysed, and material topics were prioritised  and mapped onto a Materiality Matrix. Our senior  leadership reviewed the identified material  topics.

Material Topic Risk and Crisis Management  GRI Alignment - SDG Alignment Financial Implication    /    Impact  Opportunity:  Long-term value creation through    effective risk and crisis management practices.  Risk management is the systematic process of  identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats or  uncertainties that affect an organisation. It involves  analysing risks’ likelihood and impact, developing  strategies to minimise harm, and monitoring measures’  effectiveness. When an organisation develops a risk  management plan, it identifies risks across all attributes  to devise a strategy to manage and mitigate them.  This helps in increased preparedness and awareness  about possible risks in the future while creating  long-term value for the stakeholders.

Risks and opportunities Safeguarding  the future with  effective risk  management  In today’s dynamic landscape,  businesses must navigate shifting  consumer preferences, evolving  regulations, climate challenges, and  geopolitical uncertainties. Integrating  risk management into decision ‑ making is essential for resilience and  sustainability. We have built a robust  risk management system to identify,  prioritise, monitor, and mitigate  by strong frameworks, policies,  and governance mechanisms,  our approach ensures strategic  growth, operational excellence, and  stakeholder value protection.  We continuously enhance our  risk management practices  through learning, innovation,  and employee engagement to  stay ahead in an ever-changing  environment. Our proactive  approach enables us to manage  regulatory and operational  risks effectively, while pursuing  growth opportunities through  capacity expansion and  technology upgrades. 72 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI POWER LIMITED 

Our strategy is driven by our commitment to provide  affordable power for all while effectively managing  business risks. We have established an Enterprise  Risk Management (ERM) framework to identify and  mitigate risks identified. We are able to achieve  sustained value creation and to take advantage of  growth opportunities by leveraging our experience  and capitalising on our strengths and capabilities.  We continuously enhance our risk management  practices through learning, innovation, and employee  engagement to stay ahead in an ever-changing  environment. Our proactive approach enables us to  manage regulatory and operational risks effectively,  while pursuing growth opportunities through  capacity expansion and technology upgrades.  Going forward, we are enhancing energy efficiency,  embedding sustainability deeper into our operations,  and strengthening    safety standards.  Risk Governance  Our comprehensive risk management policy and  framework enables us to identify and manage  various risks, including financial, operational,  sectoral, sustainability, IT, cyber security, and other  emerging risks.  Our Risk Management Committee (RMC), comprising  independent directors, oversees the risk appetite,  risk management framework, and governance  structure. The RMC is responsible for managing both  internal and external risks that could impact our  business. To ensure specialised risk oversight, the RMC  operates through four sub-committees:   Mergers and Acquisitions Committee   Legal, Regulatory, and Tax Committee   Reputation Risk Committee   Commodity Price Risk Committee P ortfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 73 

designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks  across our operations.  We have a dedicated risk team responsible  for addressing challenges arising from  non-compliance with our risk framework and  advising the Board on setting an appropriate  risk tolerance. The responsibility of identifying  risks lies with each department where they  identify potential risks, develop mitigation plans,  and regularly update the Chief Risk Officer on  mitigation plans.  The BRMC meets quarterly to discuss the risks  identified by the Functional Risk Committees  and Station Risk Committee. It also oversees  compliance with our risk framework, provides  guidance on risk appetite and tolerance, and  Further, the Audit Committee monitors financial  risks, including interest rate fluctuations and  other financial parameters. At the executive level, our Business Risk  Management Committee (BRMC), led by the  Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and other members,  is responsible for implementing and executing  the risk management framework. The BRMC  biannually presents the risk management  update to the Board-level RMC. We also have  Functional Risk Committees (FRCs) for Mergers  and Acquisitions Risks, Legal, Regulatory and Tax  Risks, Reputation Risks, Commodity Price Risks,  and Other Risks. Our Station Risk Committee  (SRC) focusses on risks related to project and  operational locations. The FRCs and SRC report  quarterly to the Chief Risk Officer, ensuring  continuous monitoring and timely action. At the plant level, plant heads are responsible  for identifying, notifying, and mitigating  potential risks. Each risk is assigned a dedicated  Risk Owner and Risk Champion to ensure the  successful implementation of the risk mitigation  plans and effective control measures.  Risk Management Process We have implemented an integrated ERM  framework aligned with the International  Standards ISO 31000:2018 (Risk Management  System) and COSO (Committee of Sponsoring  Organisation of the Treadway Commission)  framework.

ensures alignment with emerging regulatory  requirements, best practices in corporate  governance, and industry standards. The Company’s exposure to risk is reviewed  quarterly to ensure its resilience against potential  risks. Our risk management system is audited  internally once a year.  Risk Identification At Adani Power, risks are systematically    identified at both the enterprise and operational  levels. This process entails a comprehensive  examination of internal and external factors    that could facilitate or impede the achievement  of set objectives and expected targets.  The identified risks are then compiled in a risk  register for the power business. This register is  reviewed periodically by a council comprising  Board members. Risk Analysis Risk analysis involves the comprehensive  evaluation of uncertainties, sources,  consequences, likelihood, events, scenarios,  controls, and their efficacy, followed by the  categorisation based on severity and probability.  This aids in determining the impact value  for classifying risks as catastrophic, critical,  moderate, or marginal. Additionally, lead and lag  indicators are defined along with risk indicator  thresholds, ensuring the efficiency of risk    management processes. Each risk is aligned with performance measures  to assess its impact on business processes.  This includes measuring efficiency (In-Process)  using factors like the risk mitigation completion  index, overlooked risks, and accuracy of    identified risks. Furthermore, effectiveness is  assessed through metrics such as risks causing  losses, declining residual value, unplanned  disruptions, and adherence to recovery time as  per customer expectations. After considering mitigation strategies  and risk insurance, each risk is assigned a  residual risk impact and frequency score.  Furthermore, a dedicated risk owner and  champion are appointed to effectively mitigate  and control the identified risks. The identified risks are linked with the  organisation’s strategic or functional objectives  and relevant business processes to ensure  alignment of risk management with the broader  organisational goals. Risk Assessment and Prioritisation Risks are assessed and prioritised based on their  likelihood, impact, proximity, and controllability.  Risks are categorised into Strategic or  Reputational Risk, Tactical Risk, and Operational  Risk, with each category representing impacts  on business decisions and reputation, changes  in business conditions, and daily activities,  respectively. The risks are then presented to the  BRMC, who shall meet to oversee compliance  with the risk framework.

Risk Mitigation Comprehensive mitigation strategies are  developed, which include mitigation actions,  costs, benefits, frequency, target completion  date, and the establishment of risk indicators for  monitoring purposes.  We have established a robust governance  structure to ensure the effectiveness of    the process, with continuous reviews    conducted by the Functional and Station Risk  Management Committees. Risk Treatment At  Adani Power, there are four fundamental  approaches to risk treatment: tolerate, treat,  transfer, and terminate, also known as the 4T  analysis for risk treatment.     Tolerating risk involves accepting risks when  their potential impact is within limits or when  the anticipated profit outweighs the costs  of potential risk    Treating risk requires adjusting project plans  and company processes to reduce the impact  of risks, as well as lowering the possibility  of risk occurrence to decrease associated  financial value    Transferring risk involves sharing or distributing  risk consequences among project participants,  business departments, or third parties such as  vendors or business partners    Terminating risk means eliminating it by  mitigating its cause, often through risk  avoidance strategies to prevent consequences These approaches to risk management are  critical for ensuring the success and stability of  projects and businesses. Review and Monitoring We regularly monitor and report risks and  their mitigation status to identify trends and  prioritise measures. Furthermore, a review by the  Functional Committee, followed by the BRMC  committee, is conducted to identify focus areas  and develop mitigation plans to drive positive   risk trends. Risk Culture At  Adani Power, we uphold a culture of risk  awareness by empowering our employees  through education and training on risk  management principles. Employees at all levels  are encouraged to take ownership of risks within  their areas of responsibility. Our Board members  undergo regular familiarisation and training  on the Company’s risk landscape. The Risk  Management Committee is supported by three  non-executive Board members with expertise in  risk management. Our executive management closely monitors  various business aspects, such as fluctuating  raw material prices, equipment efficiency,  and process safety, to identify and mitigate  potential risks. Plant heads are accountable for  recognising, notifying, and mitigating observed  or anticipated risks at the plant level. To facilitate  effective risk identification, we promote open  communication across departments through  regular dialogue and an open-door policy.  To drive engagement and accountability,    we offer performance-linked incentives tied to  energy efficiency and climate change mitigation  KRAs. Given that climate change is a significant  risk, we recognise the importance of thermal  power in meeting India’s growing energy needs.  To address this, we are focussed on reducing    our environmental impact through measures    like improving efficiency and introducing  renewable resources like biomass and green  hydrogen into our fuel mix. We are also currently  piloting green ammonia co-firing at one of  our power plants, a step towards reducing our  environmental footprint. Our executive management closely  monitors various business aspects,  such as fluctuating raw material  prices, equipment efficiency, and  process safety, to identify and  mitigate potential risks. Plant heads  are accountable for recognising,  notifying, and mitigating observed or  anticipated risks at the plant level. 76 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI POWER LIMITED

Efficient Waste Management Our approach to waste management is built  on a structured process aimed at minimising  environmental impact while contributing  positively to society. From collection and  segregation to transportation, reprocessing,  recycling, and disposal, each step is designed  to ensure responsible handling of diverse waste  types. Fly ash remains the primary solid waste  from our operations, accompanied by municipal,  hazardous, biomedical, and e-waste, with disposal  methods customised to the nature of the waste. Adhering to strict regulatory standards,  we prioritise the utilisation of fly ash, a  non-hazardous waste, which poses logistical  challenges in specific regions, such as at our  Tiroda plant. Hazardous wastes, including used  oil, spent resins, and empty oil containers, are  disposed of through authorised agencies in  compliance with the Hazardous Waste Handling  and Management Rules. Key Pillars of Waste Management Our waste management strategy is structured  around four key focus areas: Waste Minimisation,  Reuse and Recycling, Safe Disposal, and  Innovation and Technology. By prioritising  the reduction of waste at its source through  optimised processes, we aim to minimise the  environmental footprint. Reuse and recycling  initiatives ensure that materials are repurposed  effectively, reducing the volume sent to landfills.

CASE STUDY Revati Patle Transforms Dairy Dreams into Village Pride  Revati Harishankar Patle, age 39 belongs to Chikkali village of Tiroda block. Her husband works at the Adani  Power Plant, and she has two school-going kids. Previously she was a housewife and the family used to run  on the limited earnings of her husband. When Adani Foundation came to their village, she started working  as a Sangini for the SUPOSHAN programme for AF and also as the secretary of Tiroda Pragatisheel Mahila  Producer Company Limited (TPMPCL). When the plan to setup a bulk milk cooler in Chikkali village was  finalised, members from MAVIM and AF held a meeting at the village to inform everyone and also mentioned  that this will be run only by women.  Revati Ji mentioned that there were lots of speculations and opinions regarding women handling the  dairy business and villagers were not at all confident with this idea. Revati Ji took up the challenge when  she approached to run the cooling centre in Chikkali by AF. She was given proper training related to milk  collection, running the bulk cooler and also keeping a check of the quality of milk received. She mentioned  that they started with a daily collection of 60 litres milk per day in 2020 and now they have gone up to a daily  collection of almost 1,500L/day.  Her monthly family income has increased from  `  10,000-12,000/month month to almost  `  25,000 per month since  the inception of the dairy. Being in charge of the bulk milk cooler, she has broken the local myth that women won’t  be able to run the dairy business. She proudly mentioned that customer count has risen to 230 from the initial  number of 20 customers. She is very happy that she is well respected across the society and also mentioned that  the District Magistrate has visited her centre and praised her for running the centre so efficiently. CASE STUDY Where Change Began with a Classroom  Devendra Ramteke lives in Chikkali village of Tiroda block and is an Adani Power employee. He is 41  years old and has a family of five members. He mentioned that the school in Chikkali previously lacked  proper infrastructure, there were no proper toilets, and the quality of education was also not that great.  The environment was not attractive at all, and it was difficult to send children to school. Lots of children from  his village were shifting to private schools and he was planning to do the same for his daughter.  Adani Foundation started improving school infrastructure way back in 2012-13. Their primary focus was to  enhance the primary education quality, make the school environment-friendly and attractive for children,  maintain cleanliness and hygiene, build proper washroom units and handwash stations. Through this they  wanted to bring back students to government schools.  Devendra Ji came to know about this from his daughter and also fellow villagers. He then visited the school  one day to see that it has transformed a lot, there was a print rich environment, new chairs and desks for  students, new library etc. The Amchi Shala Adarsh Shala Programme was introduced by AF to enhance  quality of education in schools. It created a sense of competition amongst schools in the district and this  came about as a highly effective positive change.  Her daughter was also enjoying going to school. He slowly that his daughter's performance was becoming  better, her confidence level was increasing and also, she was getting better in English and General  Knowledge. Seeing these changes, Devendra Ji himself started motivating other parents to bring back  their children to the government school. The community also acknowledged these changes and supported  the school with funds and also manpower, panchayat and they also actively participated in the school’s  development.  He proudly mentioned that her daughter had gone for an exposure visit to Mumbai and have also participated  in many district level dance competitions. Her daughter also receives benefits from various government  schemes. 166 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 ADANI POWER LIMITED

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 225 Management Discussion & Analysis The global economy in 2024 continued to face significant  challenges and opportunities shaped by various economic,  geopolitical, and policy-driven factors. Global GDP growth  is expected to moderate, with a growth rate of 3.3%  according to the ‘World Economic Outlook’ published by  International Monetary Fund (IMF). Growth varies across  regions, with advanced economies experiencing slower  expansion, while emerging markets, particularly in Asia,  maintain relatively stronger growth momentum. Geopolitical instability, notably the ongoing conflict  between Russia and Ukraine, disruptions in global supply  chains, and trade tensions between major economies  like the U.S. and China, continue to impact global  Global Economic Overview      Real GDP Growth 2024 3.3 4.3 3.7 3.9 World Output Advanced Economies Emerging Market and Developing Economies 2.8 3.0 1.4 1.5 1.8 2025 (P) 2026(P) economic stability. Additionally, climate change policies  and shifting regulatory landscapes influence investment  decisions across industries. Despite these challenges, the US economy proved  resilient, growing by 2.8% thanks to a strong labour market  and easing inflation. The Eurozone, however, saw slower  growth of 0.9%, including a slight decline in Germany.  Emerging markets, especially in Asia, maintained stronger  growth, reaching 5.3% overall, driven by technology and  infrastructure investment. China's economy expanded  by 5.0%, helped by government policies and a recovering  property market.  Global inflation is improving, projected at 5.7% in 2024,  down from 6.7% in 2023. Advanced economies are  expected to reach this target faster than emerging  markets and developing economies, where the decrease  may be slower. Inflation in advanced economies should  average 2.6% in 2024, likely reaching target levels by  late 2025. Emerging markets will see a slower, though  positive, trend. Major central banks significantly cut interest rates  to address economic challenges and stimulate  growth. The Federal Reserve lowered its federal  funds rate by 1%, landing between 4.75% and 5%  by late 2024. The European Central Bank followed  suit, reducing its deposit rate to 3.0% by December  from a peak of 4.0% earlier in the year. The Bank of  England also lowered its key interest rate to 4.5% in  November, from 5.25%, to support the UK economy  amidst uncertainty. December 2024 saw the largest  wave of rate cuts among G10 central banks since  the pandemic, totalling 825 basis points for the  year, representing an aggressive easing cycle not  seen since 2009. Global Energy Demand and Consumption Growth Electricity demand continues to rise, primarily driven by increased industrial activity, urbanisation, and the adoption  of energy-intensive technologies. Growth in electricity consumption varies by region:     Asia-Pacific The fastest-growing region  for electricity demand is  experiencing rapid growth  due to economic expansion  and industrialisation,  primarily in India and China. Africa & Latin America Emerging markets exhibit  strong growth potential, but  infrastructure challenges  remain a constraint. North America & Europe Moderate growth as these  regions transition towards  renewable energy sources and  improve energy efficiency. 

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 226 ADANI POWER LIMITED The global energy landscape is undergoing significant  changes, with renewable energy sources rapidly  expanding to replace conventional fossil-fuel based  sources and to meet increasing electricity demand.  This growth in renewables is expected to stabilise global  coal demand in the coming years. According to the  International Energy Agency (IEA), after reaching a new  high in 2024, global coal demand is projected to plateau  through 2027, as the strong deployment of renewable  energy curbs growth in coal use.  Additionally, the World Bank notes that while global coal  consumption reached an all-time high in 2022, both coal  prices and demand are expected to decline in the medium  term, reflecting a reshaping of global energy trade.  (Source: iea.org, blogs.worldbank.org) International Climate Goals The global push for sustainability was a central economic  agenda in 2024, with international climate policies  influencing investment strategies and government  priorities. The COP29 summit, held in November 2024  in Abu Dhabi, aimed to expedite the transition to clean  energy, reduce carbon emissions, and advance net-zero  commitments. Nations unveiled enhanced climate  action plans focused on expanding renewable energy,  decarbonising industries, and adopting green financing  models. However, discussions were clouded by the  United States' withdrawal from key international  climate commitments, citing economic challenges  and domestic priorities, raising concerns about global  climate collaboration. The US exit from the Paris Agreement created a  significant void in global climate action. Just months  earlier, at COP29, the US had pledged a substantial  amount towards the $300 billion climate finance goal,  indicating renewed commitment to addressing the  climate crisis. This abrupt reversal undermined collective  efforts to combat climate change and raised critical  questions about the stability of global climate finance. India's energy policy reflects a dual commitment of  promoting renewable energy to achieve net-zero goals  and ensuring coal-based power meets current and future  energy needs. This balanced approach is essential for  energy security and sustainable economic growth.

O pportunities    Government Target for Thermal Power:  India’s aim  to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel generation  capacity by 2030 presents an opportunity for Adani  Power to expand its thermal energy portfolio, as the  renewable sources of power will not be able to fulfil  the growing peak energy demand. As a result, the  Government has revised its estimates and projected  the requirement of 80GW of new thermal power  capacity, of which a significant proportion will require  investments by the private sector. The Company has  already started development of a 11.2 GW project  pipeline to capture this opportunity successfully.    Growing Power Demand in India:  With India's  rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, power  consumption is expected to grow at a CAGR  of 6% until 2030, creating opportunities for  capacity expansion.    International Expansion:  Adani Power’s recent  power supply tie-up with Bangladesh highlights its  strategy of tapping into the demand potential of  neighbouring countries to diversify revenue streams.    Technological  Advancements:  Investments in  supercritical and ultra-supercritical technologies  for thermal power plants can reduce emissions  and  improve  efficiency,  aligning  with  global  ESG  (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards. Threats    Stringent Environmental Regulations:  With India’s  commitment to reducing carbon emissions under  the Paris Agreement, regulatory pressures on  thermal power plants are intensifying. This could  impact operational costs for Adani Power.    Coal  Price  Volatility:  Adani Power’s reliance on  imported coal exposes it to price fluctuations  in the global market, especially in times of  geopolitical instability.    Intensifying Competition from Renewables:   Competitors of Adani Power are aggressively  expanding their renewable portfolios, posing a  threat to Adani Power’s market share for supply of  power under long and short-term contracts.    Reputational Risks: The Adani Group has faced  scrutiny over governance issues,  which could affect  investor  confidence  and  hinder  fundraising  for  future projects. 

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 234 ADANI POWER LIMITED For FY 2024-25, the Consolidated Total Income decreased  by 2.3% to  `  58,906 crore, compared to  `  60,281 crore  in FY 2023-24. However, consolidated continuing  total revenues were higher by 11% at  `  56,473 crore in  FY 2024-25 vs  `  50,960 crore in FY 2023-24. This growth  was supported by higher sales volumes, capacity  expansion and offset partially by lower tariff realisation.  Total Income for the year includes recognition of prior  period revenue amounting to  `  2,433 crore, compared to  `  9,322 crore in FY 2023-24 attributable to resolution  of all major regulatory matters and realisation of  outstanding dues from DISCOMs in the previous year. One-time prior period operational revenue recognised  during FY 2024-25 stood at  `  1,700 crore, rose from  `  683 crore in FY 2023-24. Higher operational income  was reported in the current year due to the resolution  of significant regulatory petitions and appeals related  to change-in-law claims for domestic coal shortfalls  under various PPAs. Prior period Other Income for FY 2024-25 was  `  733  crore, as compared to  `  8,638 crore in FY 2023-24.  This category primarily includes carrying costs on  regulatory claims and late payment surcharges on  delayed customer payments. The current year witnessed  a lower quantum of claims under these heads. Consolidated EBITDA for FY 2024-25 down by 15%  to  `  24,008 crore, compared to  `  28,111 crore in    FY 2023-24. However, consolidated continuing EBITDA  for FY 2024-25 higher by 15% at  `  21,575 crore vs  `  18,789 crore in FY 2023-24. This increase was primarily  due to higher revenue generation and lower fuel prices.  The Company's strategically located open capacity  near  major  coal  mining  regions  continued  to  benefit  from rising demand in the merchant power market and  favourable short-term tariffs, leveraging its logistical  advantage for fuel sourcing. Adani Power's PPA capacity realised a slightly lower  average net tariff for FY 2024-25 (excluding past-period  revenues) compared to FY 2023-24. This decrease was  due to reduced imported fuel prices, which led to lower  change-in-law revenue recovery. Similarly, open capacity  realised lower average tariffs during the year, but this  was offset by a significant increase in power demand  across the country. Depreciation for FY 2024-25 rose to  `  4,309 crore,  compared to  `  3,931 crore in FY 2023-24, Mainly on  account of the newly acquired power plants. Finance Costs for FY 2024-25 were  `   3,340 crore, slightly  lower than  `   3,388 crore in FY 2023-24. This decrease  was primarily due to reduced interest charges on existing  borrowings due to improved credit ratings, offset by  increment in secured and unsecured debt during the  year and acquisition of new power plants. Profit Before Tax for FY 2024-25 was  `  16,360 crore,  as against  `  20,792 crore in FY 2023-24. Profit After  Tax was  `  12,750 crore, down from  `  20,829 crore in  the previous year. Total Comprehensive Income for FY 2024-25 stood at  `  12,747 crore, compared to  `  20,801 crore in FY 2023-24. As of March 31, 2025, Total Borrowings were  `  38,335  crore, increased from  `  34,457 crore as of March 31,  2024. This increment is on account of acquisition debt  for KPL and higher working capital borrowings in line  with the increased scale of operations. Total Equity,  including Unsecured Perpetual Securities (UPS), was  `  57,674 crore as of March 31, 2025, up from  `  43,145  crore as of March 31, 2024. Performance of Subsidiaries Financial Performance of MEL: Total Income for FY 2024-25 increased by 11% to  `  4,220  crore, compared to  `  3,804 crore in FY 2023-24, driven  by higher volumes from new capacity tie-ups under a  long term PPA and increased merchant sales.  EBITDA for the year grew by 27% to  `  1,893 crore,  compared to  `  1,493 crore in the previous year, supported  by higher volumes and lower fuel costs. Depreciation for FY 2024-25 was  `  270 crore, as  against  `  98 crore in FY 2023-24, on account of higher  depreciation due to reversal of impairment provisions.  Finance Costs increased to  `  441 crore from  `  374 crore  in FY 2023-24, due to one-time impact of other finance  costs on account of capitalised other borrowing costs  being charged to P&L. Profit Before Tax and Exceptional Items increased to  `  1,182 crore in FY 2024-25, as against  `  1,021 crore  in the previous year. Exceptional Items were NIL for  FY 2024-25, in comparison to, Exceptional items of  `  2,950 crore during FY 2023-24, reflecting a reversal  of impairment provisions following improved company  performance.  Profit  After  Tax  for  FY  2024-25  was  `  374 crore, compared to  `  3.057 crore in FY 2023-24.  Total Comprehensive Income for the year was  `  373 crore,  `  3,057 crore in the previous year.

It manages its exposure  to these risks through derivative financial instruments.  The Company’s risk management activities are subject  to the management, direction and control of Treasury  Team of the Company under the framework of Risk  Management Policy for Currency and Interest rate risk  as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.  The Company’s Treasury Team ensures appropriate  financial risk governance framework for the Company  through appropriate policies and procedures and that  financial  risks  are  identified,  measured  and  managed  in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk  objectives. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in  derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken.  The decision of whether and when to execute derivative  financial  instruments  along  with  its  tenure  can  vary  from period to period depending on market conditions  and the relative costs of the instruments. The tenure is  linked to the timing of the underlying exposure, with the  connection between the two being regularly monitored. Commodity Risk The Company’s exposure to commodity prices is  affected by a number of factors including the effect  of regulations, the price volatility of coal prices in the  market, including imported coal, contract size and length,  market condition etc. which is moderated by optimising  the procurement under fuel supply agreement and  getting compensated under long term power purchase  agreements and change in law regulations. In case, the  company anticipates non-availability of coal, the same is  mitigated by sourcing imported coal in advance to meet  the demand. Its operating / trading activities require

Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues      APL conducted a double materiality assessment for FY 2023-24 and reviews it annually to align with the evolving  ESG landscape. During this exercise, we engaged with stakeholders including investors, shareholders, customers,  community members, academia, regulators, and media. The assessment followed the GRI 3: Material Topics 2021  Standards and ESRS General Disclosures, considering both impact and financial materiality. New topics added  include Digitalisation, Data Privacy and Information Security, Employee Development and Talent Retention, Labour  Practices, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Supply Chain Management, and Lifecycle Management of Assets Sr.  No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying the risk /  opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial    implications  of the risk or  opportunity  (Indicate  the positive/ negative  implications) Environment 1 Air Emissions Risk Coal-based power plants emit a  variety of pollutants, including  sulfur dioxide (SOx), nitrogen oxides  (NOx), and particulate matter (PM),  which significantly contribute to air  pollution. These emissions can lead  to respiratory and cardiovascular  diseases, thereby increasing  morbidity and mortality rates among  individuals residing in the surrounding  communities. We are consistently  implementing innovative  technologies to optimise  coal utilisation and minimise  air emissions. Additionally,  we have installed Flue Gas  Desulfurisation (FGD) units at  all our operational plant sites. Negative 2 Waste  Management Risk and  Opportunity Improper disposal of waste can lead  to the pollution of land, water, and  air, posing significant regulatory and  reputational risks over time. Sites  with high pollution loads experience  increased soil alkalinity due to the  deposition of fly ash from thermal  power plants. Additionally, these plants  emit larger and heavier solid particles,  which increase soil bulk density and  subsequently decrease soil porosity.  These pollutants can cause respiratory  and cardiovascular diseases, thereby  increasing morbidity and mortality  rates among individuals residing in the  surrounding communities.  Effective waste management can be  achieved through the reuse of waste as  by-products. We recognise the critical  importance of waste segregation  from the initial stages, and  our control measures ensure  that relevant information is  meticulously tracked until the  final disposal stage.  We are committed to reducing  single-use plastic usage, and  approximately 88% of our  power-generating units have  received certification from the  Confederation of Indian Industry  (CII) for being single-use plastic- free.  Additionally, we have installed  waste paper recycling units at  our Tiroda, Kawai, and Udupi  sites. Positive &  Negative 3 Lifecycle  Management  of Assets Risk Stranded assets in thermal power  plants refer to those assets that are  unable to achieve their original    economic return due to changes  associated with the energy transition.  Several factors can contribute to  as-sets becoming stranded, including  new government regulations that  limit the use of fossil fuels (such as  carbon pricing), shifts in demand  towards renewable energy due to lower  energy costs, and legal actions against  high emitters. We consistently integrate  technology-driven innovations  and adopt relevant energy  solutions to ensure business  continuity. Our efforts are dedicated  to preserving our assets  while enhancing operational  efficiencies. Negative

We also encourage our suppliers to adhere to social and environmental  standards such as SA 8000, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018. Additionally, we have implemented a supplier  screening and risk assessment program, which is a fundamental part of our vendor onboarding process. 

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 312 ADANI POWER LIMITED Beyond regulatory and qualitative aspects, our supplier assessment scorecard incorporates ESG (Environmental,  Social, and Governance) criteria for screening and prequalifying our suppliers. We have classified our suppliers  and identified critical ones based on the value of business and nature of supply. Our supplier screening  framework is used to assess these critical suppliers on predefined ESG parameters, which act as key enablers on  our Responsible Supply Chain journey. 3.     Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end  of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. Given the nature of our company's product and service offerings, specifically the generation of electricity, the  scope for safely reclaiming products for reuse, recycling, and disposal at the end of life is NOT APPLICABLE. In alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, we have  defined comprehensive processes for managing waste at all our operational sites. Effective waste management  begins with meticulous planning, ensuring that our waste management plan prioritises efficient and cost-effective  techniques. This plan encompasses a range of activities, including waste collection, segregation, transportation,  reprocessing, recycling, and disposal of different types of waste. Our thermal power plants generate various forms  of waste, with fly ash (a by-product of coal combustion) being the largest solid waste component. Additionally,  we handle other types of waste such as municipal or domestic waste, hazardous waste, biomedical waste, and  e-waste. The disposal methods depend on the type and quality of waste generated. Fly ash, being a significant solid waste produced from coal-based power generation, poses a landfilling challenge.  To address this, our Tiroda plant has implemented a High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) system, which  solidifies the ash for disposal. Furthermore, we have established infrastructure at other plants to transform fly  ash into a valuable material in demand by industries such as cement and ready-mix concrete. This approach  has substantially increased fly ash utilisation and supply, benefiting specialised agencies. We are dedicated to  reducing single-use plastic usage, and 9 out of 12 of our power-generating units have received certification for  being single-use plastic-free from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). At our Tiroda, Kawai, and Udupi  plants, we have installed waste-paper recycling units. Regarding hazardous waste, we generate a comparatively smaller quantity, which is stored in designated locations.  As per regulations, non-recyclable hazardous waste is sent to a State Pollution Control Board (SPCB)-approved  common treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) for proper management. We recognise the importance  of waste segregation from the initial stages, and our control measures ensure that relevant information is tracked  until the final disposal stage. Additionally, the non-hazardous waste generated at our premises, comprising scrap metal, wood, glass, tires,  e-waste, cardboard, and paper, is sold via auction. 4.

Pending final outcome / adjudications of the matters  of investigations by the Securities and Exchange  Board of India and based on management’s  assessment thereof as described in that note, no  adjustments have been made to the accompanying  standalone financial statements in this regard. b.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 347 Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter Revenue recognition and assessment of recoverability of receivables related to change in law claims  (Also refer  Notes 3(vii), 12 and 34 to the standalone financial statements)  The Company, having Power Purchase Agreements (PPA)  are eligible for compensation claims against various  Change in Law events having cost implications on  generation and supply of power such as additional duties  and taxes, increased cost of power generation, etc., due  to purchase of alternative coal in terms of the framework  of supply of power as per PPA entered by the respective  Thermal Power Plant/ Units with the various Discoms. The compensation claims (invoices) are raised by the  Company upon approval of change in law event by the  relevant Regulatory Authorities. The invoices for change  in law claims are raised considering operational / cost  parameters based on qualitative parameters approved  in terms of the relevant Regulatory Authorities Orders.  Considering that the methodology and the parameters  of  claims  are  subject  to  final  acceptance  by  the  respective Discoms, the revenue is recognised in the  books of account based on the prudent parameters and  methodology, till the respective matters are accepted /  settled with the Discoms. Thus, the revenue/ receivables from Discoms are subject  to adjustments to the extent there may be adverse impact  on account of appeals with the regulatory authorities. In certain cases where the regulatory order(s) are  subject matter of appeal with higher appellate  forums / authorities, and the amount of claims are not  ascertainable, revenues for change in law claims are not  recognised, pending outcome of the final decision. In view of the complexity and judgement involved  in estimation of the amounts of such claims and  recoverability thereof, the same is considered as a key  audit matter. Our audit procedures in response to this key audit matter  included, but not limited to, the following: -     Examined the Company’s accounting policies with  respect to assessing compliance with Ind AS 115  “Revenue from Contract with Customers”. -     Obtained understanding and evaluated the key  controls that management has in place to monitor  change in law events and related claims, status of  various pending claims including under appeals and  orders passed by various regulatory authorities. -     Inspected the relevant state regulatory commission,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC),  Appellate Tribunal and the Court rulings and  examined management assumptions / judgements  relating to various parameters in terms of such  regulatory orders, for determining the amount of  such claims. -     Examined the underlying parameters and  assumptions / judgement used for measuring /  computing the amounts of compensation claims  as  per  regulatory  orders  through  verification  of  historical information and other available internal  and external data. -     Tested on sample basis, the accuracy of the  underlying data used for computation of such  claims. -      Tested the joint reconciliations for trade receivables  performed by the Company with the respective  Discoms, wherever available with underlying records. -     Tested the status of the outstanding receivables  and recoverability of the overdue / aged receivables  through inquiry with management, and collection  trends in respect of receivables. -     Assessed the disclosures in accordance with the  requirements of Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contract  with Customers”. 

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 348 ADANI POWER LIMITED Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter Revenue recognition for regulated power generation business  (Also refer Note 34 to the standalone financial  statements) In the regulated power generation business of Udupi  Thermal Power Plant (Udupi TPP), the tariff is determined  by the regulator based on cost plus return on equity basis  wherein cost is subject to prudential norms. The Company invoices its customers on the basis of  provisional approved tariff which was based on Tariff  Regulation and is subject to true up adjustment. As  the Company is entitled to tariff based on actual cost  incurred for the year, at point of revenue recognition it  recognises adjustments for the escalation/ de-escalation  in the various parameters compared to the entitled  parameters. Accruals are determined based on tariff regulations and  past  tariff  orders  and  are  subject  to  verification  and  approval by the regulators. Further the costs incurred are  subject to prudential checks and the prescribed norms.  Significant  judgements  are  made  in  determining  the  accruals including interpretation of tariff regulations.  Further certain matters for disallowance of claims have  been litigated by the Company before higher authorities. Revenue recognition and accrual of regulatory claims is a  key audit matter considering the significant judgements  involved in the determination thereof. Our audit procedures in response to this key audit matter  included, but not limited to, the following: -   Examined the Company’s accounting policies with  respect to assessing compliance with Ind AS 115  “Revenue from Contract with Customers”. -   Performed test of controls over revenue recognition  and accruals. -   Performed the tests of details, on sample basis,  including the following key procedures:   •   Evaluated the key assumptions used by the  Company by comparing it with the assumptions  in provisional approved tariff order.   •   For tariff orders (including updated tariff order)  received by the Company, assessed the impact  recognised by the Company and for matters  litigated by the Company, also assessed the  management’s evaluation of the likely outcome  of the dispute based on past precedents.   •   Examined the underlying parameters for  measuring / computing the claims and verified  the working as per CERC regulatory orders,  Appellate Tribunal and the Court rulings. -   Tested the status of the outstanding receivables  and recoverability of the overdue / aged accruals  through inquiry with management, and collection  trends in respect of receivables. -   Assessed the disclosures in accordance with the  requirements of Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contract  with Customers” and Schedule III of the Act. Information Other than the Financial Statements  and Auditor’s Report Thereon (Other Information) The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the  other information. The other information comprises the  information included in the Annual report, but does not  include  the  standalone  financial  statements  and  our  auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does  not cover the other information and we do not express  any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information and, in doing so, consider whether such other  information is materially inconsistent with the financial  statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based  on the work we have performed, we conclude that there  is a material misstatement of this other information,  we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to  report in this regard. Responsibilities  of  the  Management  and  Those  Charged  with  Governance  for  the  Standalone  Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the  matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to  the preparation of these standalone financial statements  that give a true and fair view of the financial position,  financial  performance  including  other  comprehensive  income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company  in accordance with the accounting principles generally  accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards  (Ind  AS)  specified  under  section  133  of  the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 349 also includes maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; making judgments and estimates that are  reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,  that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the standalone  financial statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error. In  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements,  management is responsible for assessing the Company’s  ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless management  either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Charged with Governance are also responsible for  overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the standalone financial statements as  a whole are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high  level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone  financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: •     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section  143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for  expressing our opinion on whether the Company has  adequate internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s  use of the going concern basis of accounting and,  based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Company to cease to  continue as a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content  of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  standalone  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that  were of most significance in the audit of the standalone  financial  statements  for  the  financial  year  ended  March 31, 2025 and are therefore the key audit matters.  

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 350 ADANI POWER LIMITED We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless  law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and  the Standards on Auditing, as specified under section  143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit  of  internal  financial  controls,  both  issued  by  ICAI.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to  these standalone financial statements was established  and maintained and if such controls operated effectively  in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls with reference to these standalone  financial statements and their operating effectiveness.  Our audit of internal financial controls with reference  to standalone financial statements included obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  these  standalone  financial  statements,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material  misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with  reference to these standalone financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With  Reference  to  these  Standalone  Financial  Statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference  to  standalone  financial  statements  is  a  process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  standalone financial statements for external purposes  in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A company’s internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements includes  those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of standalone  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 359 expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the standalone financial statements. Inherent  Limitations  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  With  Reference  to  Standalone  Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  standalone  financial  statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial control with reference  to  standalone  financial  statements  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  standalone  financial  statements  and  such  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  standalone  financial  statements  were  operating  effectively  as  at  March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).

Derivative Financial Instruments ii.   Certain financial assets The financial statements are presented in INR ( ` )  which is also the company's functional currency and  all values are rounded to the nearest crore, except  when otherwise indicated. Amounts less than   ( ` ) 50,000 have been presented as "*". 2.2   Summary of material accounting policies   a     Property, Plant and Equipment  and Capital  Work-in-progress     Recognition and initial measurement Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at  original / acquisition cost grossed up with the  amount  of  tax  /  duty  benefits  availed,  less  accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any. All directly  attributable costs relating to the project  activities, including borrowing costs relating  to qualifying assets incurred during the project  development period, net of income earned  during the period till commercial operation  date of the project, are recorded as project  expenses and disclosed as a part of Capital  Work-in-Progress. Properties / projects in the  course of construction are carried at cost, less  any recognised impairment losses. When significant parts of plant and equipment  are required to be replaced at intervals, the  Company depreciates them separately based  on their specific useful lives. Freehold land are carried at historical cost less  accumulated impairment losses, if any. Items of stores and spares that meet the  definition  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are capitalised at cost and depreciated over  their useful life. 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 368 ADANI POWER LIMITED Depreciation In respect of Property, Plant and Equipment  covered under part A of Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013, depreciation is recognised  based on the cost of assets (other than freehold  land) less their residual values over their  useful lives, using the straight-line method in  the statement of profit and loss unless such  expenditure forms part of carrying value of  another asset. The useful life of property,  plant and equipment is considered based on  life prescribed in schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013 except in case of power plant assets,  where the life has been estimated at 25 years  or 40 years based on technical assessment,  taking into account, the estimated usage of the  assets and the current operating condition of  the assets. The management believes that these  estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect  fair approximation of the period over which the  assets are likely to be used. The estimated useful  lives, residual values and depreciation method  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,  with the effect of any changes in estimate  accounted for on a prospective basis. Major inspection / overhauling including  turnaround and maintenance cost are  depreciated over the period of 5 years. All other  repair and maintenance costs are recognised in  the statement of profit and loss as incurred. Assets class wise useful life of the Property,  Plant and Equipment (except for Udupi Thermal  Power Plant ("Udupi TPP") are mentioned below : Assets Class Useful Life   (In years) Right-of-Use Assets - lower of  lease term or useful life 3 to 99 Buildings - Township, Hostels,  Residential flats etc. 60 Buildings - Plant offices,  Boundary walls, Civil works etc. 30 Buildings - Others 3 to 42 Plant and Equipment - Capital  Overhauling and Others 2 to 6 Assets Class Useful Life   (In years) Plant and Equipment -  Desalination and Flue Gas  Desulfurisation, Cooling Tower  and Ancillary Tower 5 to 25 Plant and Equipment - Boiler,  Turbine and Generators 12 to 40 Furniture and Fixtures 1 to 10 Railway Sidings 5 to 15 Computer Hardware 3 to 6 Office Equipment 3 to 5 Vehicles - Four and Two  Wheelers 8 to 10 Vehicles - Others 3 to 25 In respect of Property, Plant and Equipment    covered under part B of Schedule II to  the Companies Act, 2013, depreciation is  recognised based on the cost of Property,  Plant and Equipment (other than freehold  land) at the rates as well as methodology  notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory  Commission (''CERC") (Terms and Conditions of  Tariff) Regulations, 2019 in the statement of  profit and loss unless such expenditure forms  part of carrying value of another asset under  construction mainly in respect of Udupi TPP.  In case of assets with useful life lesser than  the Power Plant Project life, the useful life  of these assets has been considered for the  purpose of calculation of depreciation as per  the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and  subsequent amendments thereto. In case of Udupi TPP, Property, Plant and  Equipment class wise depreciation rates are  mentioned below: Assets Class (In %) Right-of-Use Assets - lower of  lease term or useful life 5.00 to  20.00 Buildings - Temporary  Structures 20.00 to  25.00 Buildings - Others 3.34 Plant and Equipment - Boiler,  Turbine and Generator 5.28

The carrying  amount of any component accounted for as a  separate asset is derecognised when replaced.  All other repairs and maintenance are charged  to profit or loss during the reporting period  in which they are incurred. Subsequent costs  are depreciated over the residual life of the  respective assets. The residual values, useful  lives and methods of depreciation of property,  plant and equipment are reviewed at each  financial year end and adjusted prospectively,  if appropriate. De-recognition An item of property, plant and equipment  and any significant part initially recognised is  derecognised upon disposal or when no future  economic benefits are expected to arise from  the continued use of the asset. Any gain or  loss arising on the disposal or retirement of  an item of property, plant and equipment is  determined as the difference between the  sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the  asset and is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.   b   Current versus non-current classification The operating cycle is the time between the  acquisition of assets for processing and their  realisation in cash and cash equivalents.  The  Company  has  identified  twelve  months  as its operating cycle for determining current  and  non-current  classification  of  assets  and  liabilities in the Balance sheet. Deferred Tax Assets and liabilities are classified  as non-current assets and liabilities.   c   Financial Instruments A Financial Instrument is any contract that  gives  rise  to  a  financial  asset  of  one  entity  and a financial liability or equity instrument of  another entity. Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are initially measured at fair value with the  exception of trade receivables that do not  contain significant financing component or for  which the Company has applied the practical  expedient. The Company initially measures  a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the  case  of  a  financial  asset  not  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  the  transaction  cost.  Transaction costs that are directly attributable  to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and  financial liabilities (other than financial assets  and  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit or loss) are added to or deducted from  the fair value of the financial assets or financial  liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.  Transaction costs directly attributable to the  acquisition  of  financial  assets  or  financial  liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  recognised immediately in the statement of  profit and loss.   d   Financial assets     Initial recognition and measurement All regular way purchases or sales of financial  assets, that require delivery of assets within  a time frame established by regulation or  convention in the market place (regular way  trades) are recognised and derecognised on a  trade date basis i.e. the date that the Company  commits to purchase or sell the assets.    Subsequent  measurement All recognised financial assets are subsequently  measured in their entirety at either amortised  cost or fair value, depending on the classification  of the financial assets. 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 370 ADANI POWER LIMITED     Classification of Financial assets     Financial assets measured at amortised cost Financial assets that meet the criteria for  subsequent measurement at amortised cost  are measured using effective interest method  ("EIR") (except for debt instruments that are  designated as at fair value through profit or  loss on initial recognition): a)     the asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets in order  to collect contractual cash flows; and b)     Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated by taking  into account any discount or premium on  acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral  part of the EIR.       Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI) Financial assets that meet the criteria for initial  recognition at FVTOCI are remeasured at fair  value at the end of each reporting date through  other comprehensive income (OCI): a)     The objective of the business model  is achieved both by collecting  contractual cash flows and selling the  financial assets, and b)      The contractual terms of the asset that  give  rise  on  specified  dates  to  cash  flows that represent solely payment of  principal and interest.       Financial assets at fair value through profit or  loss (FVTPL) Financial assets that do not meet the amortised  cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria are remeasured  at fair value at the end of each reporting date  through profit and loss.     Impairment of Financial assets The Company applies the expected credit  loss model for recognising impairment loss on  financial assets measured at amortised cost,  trade receivables and other contractual rights  to receive cash or other financial asset. The Company measures the loss allowance for  a Trade Receivables and Contract Assets by  following  'simplified  approach'  at  an  amount  equal to the lifetime expected credit losses  ("ECL").  In  case  of  other  financial  assets,  12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment  loss and where credit risk has increased  significantly, lifetime ECL is used.     Derecognition of financial assets On  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset  in  its entirety, the difference between the  asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the  consideration received and receivable and  the cumulative gain or loss that had been  recognised in other comprehensive income  and accumulated in equity, is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss if such gain or loss  would have otherwise been recognised in the  statement of profit and loss on disposal of that  financial asset.   e   Financial liabilities and equity instruments     Classification as debt or equity Debt and equity instruments issued by the  Company  are  classified  as  either  financial  liabilities or as equity in accordance with the  substance of the contractual arrangements  and the definitions of a financial liability and  an  equity  instrument.  Compound  financial  instruments are separated into liability and  equity components based on the terms  of the contract.     Instruments entirely Equity in nature Unsecured perpetual securities (“securities”)  are  the  securities  with  no  fixed  maturity  or  redemption and the same are callable only  at the option of issuer. These securities  are ranked senior only to the equity share  capital of the Company and the issuer does  not have any redemption obligation hence  these securities are recognised as equity as  per Ind AS 32.   

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 371     Financial liabilities     Initial recognition and measurement All financial liabilities are recognised initially at  fair value and in the case of financial liabilities  at amortised cost, net of directly attributable  transaction costs.     Subsequent Measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement,  financial  liabilities  are  classified  under  two categories:   y Financial liabilities at fair value through   profit or loss   y Financial liabilities at amortised cost     Classification of Financial liabilities       Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL)       Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or  loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for  trading and financial liabilities designated upon  initial recognition at fair value through profit or  loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held  for trading if these are incurred for the purpose  of repurchasing in the near term. This category  also includes derivative financial instruments  entered into by the Company that are not  designated as hedging instruments in hedge  relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.       Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are  recognised in the profit or loss.       Financial liabilities designated upon initial  recognition at fair value through profit or loss  are designated as such at the initial date of  recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109  are satisfied. Subsequent changes in fair value  of liabilities are recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.       Fair values are determined in the manner  described in note 'm'.     Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Financial liabilities that are not held-for- trading and are not designated as at FVTPL  are measured at amortised cost at the end of  subsequent accounting periods. The carrying  amounts  of  financial  liabilities  that  are  subsequently measured at amortised cost are  determined based on the effective interest  method. Interest expense that is not capitalised  as part of costs of an asset is included in the  'Finance costs' line item in the statement of  profit and loss.     Derecognition of financial liabilities On derecognition, the difference between  the carrying amount of the financial liability  derecognised and the consideration paid /  payable is recognised in the statement of profit  and loss. In case of derecognition of financial  liabilities relating to promoters contribution,  the difference between the carrying amount  of the financial liability derecognised and the  consideration paid / payable is recognised  in other equity.     Offsetting of Financial Instruments Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  offset and the net amount is reported in the  balance sheet if there is a legally enforceable  right (not contingent on future events) to  off-set the recognised amounts and there is an  intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the  assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.     Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantee contracts issued by the  Company are those contracts that require a  payment to be made to reimburse the holder  for  a  loss  it  incurs  because  the  specified  debtor fails to make a payment when due in  accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.  Financial guarantee contracts are recognised  initially as a liability at fair value through  profit  or  loss,  adjusted  for  transaction  costs  that are directly attributable to the issuance  of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability  is measured at the higher of the amount of  loss allowance determined as per impairment  requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount  recognised less cumulative amortisation.   f   Derivative financial instruments The Company enters into a variety of derivative  financial instruments to manage its exposure  to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 372 ADANI POWER LIMITED on borrowings / purchases, including foreign  exchange forward contracts, interest rate  swaps and cross currency swaps, Principal only  Swap, coupon only swap etc. Further details  of  derivatives  financial  instruments  are  disclosed in note 51. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value  at the date the derivative contracts are entered  into and are subsequently remeasured to their  fair value at the end of each reporting period.  Derivatives  are  carried  as  financial  assets  when the fair value is positive and as financial  liabilities when the fair value is negative.  The resulting gain or loss is recognised in  the statement of profit and loss immediately,  except for the effective portion of cash flow  hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later  reclassified to profit and loss.   g   Hedge Accounting The Company designates certain hedging  instruments, which mainly includes derivatives  in respect of foreign currency risk, as  cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the  Company formally designates and documents  the relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item, along with its  risk management objectives and its strategy  for undertaking various hedge transactions.  Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and  on an ongoing basis, the Company documents  whether the hedging instrument is highly  effective in offsetting changes in fair value or  cash flows of the hedged item attributable to  the hedged risk.     Cash flow hedges The Company uses forward currency contracts  as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency  risk  in  forecast  transactions  and  firm  commitments. The Company designates only  the spot element of a forward contract as a  hedging instrument. The forward element  is recognised in OCI. The ineffective portion  relating to foreign currency contracts is  recognised in finance costs.     h   Investments in subsidiaries and associates Investments in subsidiaries and associates are  accounted for at cost, net of impairment, if any.  (Also refer note 3(v)).   i   Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net  realisable value after providing for obsolescence  and other losses where considered necessary.  Costs include all non-refundable duties and  all charges incurred in bringing the goods to  their present location and condition. Cost is  determined on First in First out basis (FIFO) for  coal inventory and on weighted average basis  for other than coal inventory. Net realisable  value represents estimated selling price of  inventories and in case of coal inventory it also  includes the tariff price recoverable from supply  of power generated from usage of coal less all  estimated cost necessary to make the sale.   Stores and Spares which do not meet the  definition of property, plant and equipment are  accounted as inventories.   j   Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet  comprise cash at banks and on hand and  short-term deposits with an original maturity of  three months or less, that are readily convertible  to a known amount of cash and subject to an  insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows,  cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and  short-term  deposits,  as  defined  above,  net  of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are  considered an integral part of the Company’s  cash management.   k   Business combinations and Goodwill Acquisitions of business are accounted  for using the acquisition method except  business combination under common control.  The consideration transferred in a business  combination is measured at fair value, which is  calculated as the sum of the acquisition date  fair values of the assets transferred by the  Company, liabilities incurred by the Company to  the former owners of the acquiree and the equity  interest issued by the Company in exchange  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 373 of control of the acquiree. Acquisition related  costs are charged to the statement of profit  and loss for the periods in which the costs are  incurred and the services are received, with the  exception of the costs of issuing debt or equity  securities that are recognised in accordance  with Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 109.   A business combination involving entities or  businesses under common control is a business  combination in which all of the combining  entities or businesses are ultimately controlled  by the same party or parties both before  and after the business combination and the  control is not transitory. The transactions  between entities under common control are  specifically covered by appendix C of Ind AS  103. Such transactions are accounted for using  the pooling-of-interest method. The assets and  liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised  at their carrying amounts of the Company’s  financial  statements.  No  adjustments  are  made to reflect fair values or recognise any  new assets or liabilities. The components of  equity of the acquired companies are added  to the same components within the Company’s  equity. The difference, if any, between the  amounts recorded as share capital issued plus  any additional consideration in the form of  cash or other assets and the amount of share  capital of the transferor is transferred to capital  reserve and is presented separately from other  capital reserves. The Company’s shares issued  in consideration for the acquired companies  are recognised from the moment the acquired  companies  are  included  in  these  financial  statements  and  the  financial  statements  of  the commonly controlled entities would be  combined, retrospectively, as if the transaction  had occurred at the beginning of the earliest  reporting period  presented. If the initial accounting for a business  combination is incomplete by the end of the  reporting period in which the combination  occurs, the Company reports provisional  amounts for the items for which the  accounting is incomplete. Those provisional  amounts are adjusted through Capital Reserve  / goodwill during the measurement period, or  additional assets or liabilities are recognised,  to reflect new information obtained about  facts and circumstances that existed at the  acquisition date that, if known, would have  affected the amounts recognised at that date.  These adjustments are called as measurement  period adjustments. The measurement  period does not exceed one year from the  acquisition date. Purchase consideration paid in excess /  shortfall of the fair value of identifiable assets  and liabilities including contingent liabilities  and contingent assets, is recognised as  goodwill / capital reserve respectively, except in  case where different accounting treatment is  specified in the court / National Company Law  Tribunal ("NCLT") approved scheme. However, the following assets and liabilities  acquired in a business combination are  measured at the basis indicated below: •     Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and  liabilities or assets related to employee  benefits arrangements are recognised and  measured in accordance with Ind AS 12  “Income Taxes” and Ind AS 19 “Employee  Benefits” respectively. •     Potential tax effects of temporary  differences and carry forwards of an  acquiree that exist at the acquisition date  or arise as a result of the acquisition are  accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12. Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business  is carried at cost as established at the date of  acquisition of the business less accumulated  impairment losses, if any. For the purposes of impairment testing,  goodwill is allocated to each of the  Company's cash-generating units (or group  of cash-generating units) that is expected to  benefit from the synergies of the combination. A cash-generating unit to which goodwill  has been allocated is tested for impairment  annually, or more frequently when there is an  indication that the unit may be impaired. If the  recoverable amount of the cash-generating  unit is less than its carrying amount, the  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 374 ADANI POWER LIMITED impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the  carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to  the unit and then to the other assets of the  unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of  each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for  goodwill is recognised directly in statement of  profit and loss. An impairment loss recognised  for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent  periods.                  On disposal of the relevant cash-generating  unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is  included in the determination of the profit or  loss on disposal.   l   Foreign currency translations and transactions In preparing the financial statements of the  Company, transactions in currencies other than  the entity’s functional currency are recognised  at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of  the transactions. At the end of each reporting  period, monetary items denominated in foreign  currencies are retranslated at the rates  prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items  that are measured in terms of historical cost in  a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in which they arise except for exchange  differences on foreign currency borrowings  relating to assets under construction for future  productive use, which are included in the cost  of those assets when they are regarded as an  adjustment to interest costs on those foreign  currency borrowings. The Company has elected to continue the  policy adopted for accounting for exchange  differences arising from translation of  long-term foreign currency monetary items  outstanding  and  recognised  in  the  financial  statements for the period ending immediately  before  the  beginning  of  the  first  Ind  AS  financial reporting period i.e. March 31, 2016 as  per the previous GAAP.   m   Fair value measurement The Company measures financial instruments  such as derivatives and mutual funds at fair  value at each balance sheet date. The Company’s management determines the  policies and procedures for both recurring  fair value measurement, such as derivative  instruments  and  unquoted  financial  assets  measured at fair value. The Company uses valuation techniques that  are appropriate in the circumstances and for  which sufficient data are available to measure  fair value, maximising the use of relevant  observable inputs and minimising the use of  unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value  is  measured  or  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements are categorised within the fair  value hierarchy, described as follows, based on  the lowest level input that is significant to the  fair value measurement as a whole: -     External valuers are involved for valuation  of  significant  assets  such  as  unquoted  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  and derivatives. -     For assets and liabilities that are  recognised in the financial statements on  a recurring basis, the Company determines  whether transfers have occurred between  levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing  categorisation (based on the lowest level  input that is significant to the fair value  measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the  Company  has determined classes of assets  and liabilities on the basis of the nature,  characteristics and risks of the asset or liability  and the level of the fair value hierarchy as  explained above.   n   Government grants The Company recognises government  grants only when there is reasonable  assurance that grant will be received, and  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 375 all the attached conditions will be complied  with. Where Government grants relates to  non-monetary assets, the cost of assets is  presented at gross value and grant significantly  complied thereon is recognised as income in  the statement of profit and loss over the useful  life of the related assets in proportion in which  depreciation is charged. Grants related to income are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss in the same period  as the related cost which they are intended to  compensate are accounted for.   o   Contract Balances     Contract assets A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Company performs by  transferring goods or services to a customer  before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that  is conditional. Contract assets are subject to  impairment assessment.       Trade receivables A receivable represents the Company’s  right to an amount of consideration that is  unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is  required before payment of consideration is  due and the amount is billable.     Contract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which the  Company has received consideration from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised  as revenue when the Company performs  obligations under the contract.   p   Revenue recognition Revenue from contracts with customers is  recognised when control of the goods or  services are transferred to the customer at  an amount that reflects the consideration to  which the Company expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is measured based on the transaction  price, which is the consideration, adjusted  for discounts and other incentives, if any, as  specified in the contract with the customer.  Revenue also excludes taxes or other amounts  collected from customers. The  disclosure  of  significant  accounting  judgements, estimates and assumptions  relating to revenue from contracts with  customers are provided in Note 3 (vii). The  specific  recognition  criteria  described  below must also be met before revenue  is recognised.       i)   Revenue from Power Supply The Company’s contracts with customers  for the sale of electricity generally include  one performance obligation. The Company  has concluded that revenue from sale of  electricity should be recognised at the  point in time when electricity is transferred  to the customer.   The Company has generally concluded that  it is principal in its revenue arrangements.  However, where the company is acting as  an agent, the company recognises revenue  at the net amount that is retained for  these arrangements. Revenue from operations on account of  Force Majeure events / change in law  events in terms of PPAs / SPPAs with  customers (Power Distribution Utilities)  is accounted for by the Company based  on the orders / reports of Regulatory  Authorities, best management estimates  wherever needed and reasonable certainty  to expect ultimate collection. In case of PPA under section 62 of  Electricity Act, 2003, revenue from sale  of power is recognised based on the most  recent tariff order approved by the CERC,  as  modified  by  the  orders  of  Appellate  Tribunal for Electricity ("APTEL"), to  the extent applicable, having regard to  mechanism provided in applicable tariff  regulations and the bilateral arrangements  with the customers. Where the tariff rates  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 376 ADANI POWER LIMITED are yet to be approved, provisional rates  are adopted considering the applicable  CERC Tariff Regulations.     ii)   Sale of traded goods and fly ash Revenue from the sale of traded goods and  fly ash is recognised at the point in time  when control of the goods is transferred to  the customers, which generally coincides  with the delivery of goods.    iii)    Carrying cost in respect of claims for  change in law of taxes and duties,  additional cost incurred on procurement  of alternative coal and on other claims  are recognised upon approval by relevant  regulatory authorities, best management  estimates and based on reasonable  certainty to expect ultimate collection.    iv)     Interest income is recognised on time  proportion basis at the effective interest  rate ("EIR") applicable.    v)    Late payment surcharge on delayed  payment for power supply is recognised  based on receipt / collection from customers  or on acceptance / acknowledgement by  the customers whichever is earlier.   q   Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of  qualifying assets, that necessarily take a  substantial period of time to get ready for their  intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of  the cost of the asset, until such time as the  assets are substantially ready for their intended  use or sale. Interest income earned on the  temporary investment of specific borrowings  pending their expenditure on qualifying assets  is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible  for capitalisation. All other borrowing costs are recognised in  statement  of  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in which they are incurred. Borrowing cost  consist of interest and other costs that an  entity incurs in connection with the borrowing  of funds. Borrowing cost also includes  exchange differences arising from foreign  currency borrowing.   r   Employee benefits     i)   Defined benefit plans:     The Company has obligation towards  gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan  covering eligible employees (in some cases  funded through Group Gratuity Scheme  of Life Insurance Corporation of India).  The Company accounts for the liability  for the gratuity benefits payable in future  and  its  classifications  between  current  and non-current liabilities are based on an  independent actuarial valuation carried  out using Projected Unit Credit Method.     Defined  benefit  costs  in  the  nature  of current and past service cost and  net interest expense or income are  recognised in the statement of profit and  loss in the period in which they occur.  Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial  gains and losses, the effect of changes  to the asset ceiling (excluding amounts  included in net interest or the net defined  benefit  liability)  and  the  return  on  plan  assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest on the net defined benefit liability)  are recognised immediately in the balance  sheet with corresponding debit or credit to  retained earnings through OCI in the period  in which it occurs. Remeasurement are not  classified to statement of profit and loss  in subsequent periods. Past service cost is  recognised in the statement of profit and  loss in the period of a plan amendment.     ii)   Defined contribution plan: Retirement  Benefits  in  the  form  of  Provident Fund and Family Pension Fund  which are defined contribution schemes  are  charged  to  the  statement  of  profit  and loss for the period in which the  contributions to the respective funds  accrue as per relevant statues.     iii)   Compensated Absences: Provision for Compensated Absences  and  its  classifications  between  current  and non-current liabilities are based  on independent actuarial valuation.  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 377 The actuarial valuation is done as per the  projected unit credit method as at the  reporting date.     iv)   Short term employee benefits: These are recognised at an undiscounted  amount  in  the  Statement  of  profit  and  loss for the year in which the related  services are rendered.   s   Leases The Company assesses at contract inception  whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.  That is, if the contract conveys the right to  control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset  for  a  period of time in exchange for consideration.     The Company as lessee   The Company recognises right-of-use assets  and lease liabilities for all leases except for  short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.   The Company applies the available practical  expedients wherein it: y   Uses a single discount rate to a portfolio  of leases with reasonably similar  characteristics y   Relies on its assessment of whether leases  are onerous immediately before the date  of initial application y   Applies the short-term leases exemptions  to leases with lease term that ends within  12 months at the date of initial application y 	 Excludes the initial direct costs from the  measurement of the right-of-use asset at  the date of initial application y   Uses hindsight in determining the lease  term where the contract contains options  to extend or terminate the lease    Right-of-use  assets The company recognises right-of-use assets at  the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the  date the underlying asset is available for use). The cost of right-of-use assets includes the  amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial  direct costs incurred, and lease payments made  at or before the commencement date less any  lease incentives received. Refer note 'a' for  useful life of right-of-use assets.   The right-of-use assets are also subject to  impairment. Refer note 'w' for impairment of  non-financial assets.    Lease  Liabilities The Company records the lease liabilities at the  present value of the lease payments discounted  at the incremental borrowing rate at the date  of initial application and right-of-use asset  at an amount equal to the lease liabilities  adjusted for any prepayments recognised in  the balance sheet. The lease payments include  fixed payments (including in substance fixed  payments) less any lease incentives receivable,  variable lease payments that depend on an  index or a rate and amounts expected to be  paid under residual value guarantees. The lease  payments also include the exercise price of  a purchase option reasonably certain to be  exercised by the Company and payments of  penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease  term reflects the Company exercising the option  to terminate. Variable lease payments that do  not depend on an index or a rate are recognised  as expenses in the period in which the event or  condition that triggers the payment occurs.     Subsequent measurement of lease liabilities The lease liabilities is remeasured when  there is change in future lease payments  arising from a change in an index or a rate or  a change in the estimate of the guaranteed  residual value or a change in the assessment  of purchase, extension or termination option.  When the lease liabilities is measured, the  corresponding adjustment is reflected in the  right-of-use assets.   t   Taxes on Income Tax expenses comprises current tax and  deferred tax. These are recognised in the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  except  to  the  extent that it relates to a business combination,  or items recognised directly in equity or in other  comprehensive income. 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 378 ADANI POWER LIMITED    Current  tax Tax on income for the current period is  determined on the basis of estimated  taxable income and tax credits computed in  accordance with the provisions of the relevant  tax laws and based on the expected outcome  of assessments / appeals. Current income  tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the amount expected to be recovered  from or paid to the taxation authorities.  Management periodically evaluates positions  taken in the tax returns with respect to  situations in which applicable tax regulations  are subject to interpretation and establishes  provisions where appropriate. Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  outside  profit or loss (either in other comprehensive  income or in equity). Current tax items are  recognised in correlation to the underlying  transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.  Management periodically evaluates positions  taken in the tax returns with respect to  situations in which applicable tax regulations  are subject to interpretation and establishes  provisions where appropriate.    Deferred  tax Deferred tax is recognised for the future  tax consequences of deductible temporary  differences between the carrying values of  assets and liabilities and their respective  tax bases at the reporting date.  Deferred  tax liabilities are generally recognised for all  taxable temporary differences except when  the deferred tax liability arises at the time of  transaction that affects neither the accounting  profit  or  loss  nor  taxable  profit  or  loss.  Deferred tax assets are generally recognised  for all deductible temporary differences, carry  forward of unused tax credits and any unused  tax losses, to the extent that it is probable  that future taxable income will be available  against which the deductible temporary  differences and carry forward of unused tax  credit and unused tax losses can be utilised  except when the deferred tax asset relating  to temporary differences arising at the time  of transaction affects neither the accounting  profit  or  loss  nor  the  taxable  profit  or  loss.  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at each reporting date and reduced  to the extent that it is no longer probable that  sufficient  taxable  profit  will  be  available  to  allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to  be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets  are re-assessed at each reporting date and are  recognised to the extent that it has become  probable that future taxable profits will allow  the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Deferred tax relating to items recognised  outside profit and loss is recognised outside  profit and loss (either in other comprehensive  income or in equity). Deferred tax items are  recognised in correlation to the underlying  transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. The Company offsets deferred tax assets and  deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally  enforceable right to set off current tax assets  and current tax liabilities and the deferred  tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate  to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority on the same taxable entity which  intend either to settle current tax liabilities and  assets on a net basis or to realise the assets  and settle the liabilities simultaneously in each  future period in which significant amounts of  deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to  be settled or recovered. When there is uncertainty regarding income tax  treatments, the Company assesses whether a  tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax  treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority  is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment,  the effect of the uncertainty on taxable  income, tax bases and unused tax losses and  unused tax credits is recognised. The effect of  the uncertainty is recognised using the method  that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of  the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the  expected value. For each case, the Company  evaluates whether to consider each uncertain  tax treatment separately or in conjunction  with another or several other uncertain tax  treatments based on the approach that best  prefixes the resolution of uncertainty. 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 379   u   Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing  the  profit  after  tax  (net  off  distribution  on  Perpetual Securities whether declared or not)  attributable to the owners of the company by  the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings  per share is computed by dividing the profit  after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual  Securities whether declared or not) attributable  to the owners of the company as adjusted  for the effects of dividend, interest and other  charges relating to the dilutive potential equity  shares by weighted average number of shares  plus dilutive potential equity shares.   v    Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets The amount recognised as a provision is the  best estimate of the consideration required to  settle the present obligation at the end of the  reporting period, taking into account the risks  and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that  arises from past events whose existence will be  confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events beyond  the control of the Company or a present  obligation that is not recognised because it is  not probable that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation or a reliable  estimate of amount cannot be made. Contingent liabilities may arise from litigation,  taxation and other claims against the Company.  The contingent liabilities are disclosed where it  is management's assessment that the outcome  of any litigation and other claims against the  Company is uncertain or cannot be reliably  quantified, unless the likelihood of an adverse  outcome is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised but  are disclosed in the notes where an inflow of  economic benefits is probable. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent  assets are reviewed at each reporting date. A contingent liability recognised in a  business combination is initially measured  at its fair value. Subsequently, it is  remeasured as per provisions of Ind AS 103.   w   Impairment of non-financial assets The Company assesses, at each reporting date  whether there is any indication that assets may  be impaired. If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the asset’s recoverable  amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the  higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit  ("CGU") is fair value less costs to disposal and  its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future  cash flows are discounted to their present  values using a pre-tax discount rate that  reflects current market assessment of the  time value of money and the risks specific to  the asset. In determining fair value less cost of  disposal, recent market transactions are taken  into account. If no such transactions can be  identified,  an  appropriate  valuation  model  is  used. These calculations are corroborated by  valuation multiples, quoted share prices for  publicly traded companies or other available  fair value indicators. The Company enters into transaction with  suppliers that involves prepayment in  conjunction with advances for goods and  services wherein the Company assesses at  each reporting date whether goods against  the advance is recoverable and if there is any  indication, the asset may be provided.   Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as  at March 31 and when circumstances indicate  that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by  assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU  (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. The Company bases its impairment calculation  on detailed budget and forecast calculations,  which are prepared separately for each of  the Company's cash-generating unit to which  the individual assets are allocated. For longer  periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated  and applied to project future cash flows.  To estimate cash flow projections beyond  periods covered by the most recent budget /  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 380 ADANI POWER LIMITED forecasts, the Company estimates cash flow  projections based on estimated growth rate. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or  cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced  to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss  is recognised immediately in the statement of  profit and loss.   x   Mine Development Expenditure i)     Expenditure incurred towards coal mines  under construction are capitalised to  ‘Coal Mines under construction’ as long as  they meet the capitalisation criteria and  is presented as capital work-in-progress.  Upon commencement of production stage,  the ‘Coal Mines under construction’ is  capitalised and presented as ‘Mining Rights’  under Intangible Assets except in situation  when the Company decide to surrender its  rights in mine and amount is classified as  recoverable from Nominated Authorities. ii)     Mining Rights are amortised using unit-of- production method on the basis of proven  and probable reserves on commencement  of commercial production.     Mine Closure Obligations The liability for meeting the mine closure has  been estimated based on the mine closure plan  in the proportion of total area exploited to the  total area of the mine as a whole. These costs  are updated annually during the life of the mine  to reflect the developments in mining activities.  The mine closure obligations are included in  Mining Rights under Intangible assets and  amortised based on unit of production method.    y   Amended standards adopted by the Company    The accounting policies adopted in the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  are consistent with those followed in the  preparation of the Company's annual financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2024,  except for amendments to the existing Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS). The Company  has not early adopted any other standard,  interpretation or amendment that has been  issued but is not yet effective. The  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs  notified  new standards or amendment to existing  standards under Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. The Company applied following amendments  for the first-time during the current year which  are effective from April 1, 2024: i)   Introduction of Ind AS 117     MCA notified Ind AS 117, a comprehensive  standard that prescribe, recognition,  measurement and disclosure requirements,  to avoid diversities in practice for  accounting insurance contracts and  it applies to all companies i.e., to all  "insurance contracts" regardless of the  issuer. However, Ind AS 117 is not applicable  to the entities which are insurance  companies registered with IRDAI.     Additionally, amendments have been made  to Ind AS 101, First-time Adoption of Indian  Accounting Standards, Ind AS 103, Business  Combinations, Ind AS 105, Non-current  Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued  Operations, Ind AS 107, Financial Instruments:  Disclosures, Ind AS 109, Financial  Instruments and Ind AS 115, Revenue from  Contracts with Customers to align them with  Ind AS 117. The amendments also introduce  enhanced disclosure requirements,  particularly in Ind AS 107, to provide clarity  regarding  financial  instruments  associated  with insurance contracts. ii)     Amendments to Ind AS 116 -Lease liability  in a sale and leaseback     The amendments require an entity to  recognise lease liability including variable  lease payments which are not linked to  index or a rate in a way it does not result  into gain on Right-of-use asset it retains.     The Company has reviewed the new  pronouncements and based on its evaluation  has determined that these amendments  do not have a significant impact on the  Company's Financial Statements. 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 381 3     Significant  accounting  judgements,  estimates and assumptions The  preparation  of  the  Company’s  financial  statements  requires management to make  judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets  and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures,  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.  The estimates and assumptions are based on  historical experience and other factors including  expectations of future events that are considered  to be relevant. The estimates and underlying  assumptions are continually evaluated and any  revisions thereto are recognised in the period of  revision and future periods if the revision affects    both the current and future periods. Uncertainties  about these assumptions and estimates could result  in outcomes that require a material adjustment to  the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected  in future periods.   Key Sources of estimation uncertainty : The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  year are described below.  Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments may  change due to market changes or circumstances  arising that are beyond the control of the Company.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur.   i)   Useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment In case of the power plant equipment, where  the life of the assets has been estimated at 25  or 40 years based on technical assessment,  taking into account the estimated usage of the  asset and the current operating condition of  the asset, depreciation on the same is provided  based on the useful life of each component  based on technical assessment, if materially  different from that of the main asset.   ii)     Fair  value  measurement  of  financial  instruments In estimating the fair value of financial assets  and  financial  liabilities,  the  Company  uses  market observable data to the extent available.  Where such Level 1 inputs are not available,  the Company establishes appropriate valuation  techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not  feasible, a degree of judgement is required in  establishing fair values. Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in  assumptions about these factors could affect  the reported fair value of financial instruments.  Information about the valuation techniques  and inputs used in determining the fair  value of various assets and liabilities are  disclosed in note 55.   iii)   Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan  and the present value of the gratuity obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include  the determination of the discount rate, future  salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities involved in the valuation and its  long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation  is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed  at each reporting date. Information about  the various estimates and assumptions made  in  determining  the  present  value  of  defined  benefit obligations are disclosed in note 59.   iv)   Impairment of non financial assets For determining whether Property, Plant and  Equipment, intangible asset and goodwill  are impaired, it requires an estimation of the  value in use of the relevant cash generating  units. The value in use calculation is based  on a Discounted Cash Flow model over the  estimated useful life of the Power Plants.  Further, the cash flow projections are based on  estimates and assumptions relating to tariff,  change in law claims, operational performance  of the Plants, life extension plans, market prices  of coal and other fuels, exchange variations,  inflation, terminal value etc. which are  

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 382 ADANI POWER LIMITED considered reasonable by the Management.  (Refer note 50).   v)     Impairment of Investments made / Loans given  to subsidiaries In case of investments made and loans  given by the Company to its subsidiaries,  the Management assesses whether there is  any indication of impairment in the value of  investments and loans. The carrying amount  is compared with the present value of future  net cash flow of the subsidiaries based on its  business model or estimates is made of the  fair value of the identified assets held by the  subsidiaries, as applicable.   vi)   Taxes Significant management judgement is required  to determine the amount of deferred tax assets  that can be recognised, based upon the likely  timing and the level of future taxable profits  together with future tax planning strategies,  including estimates of temporary differences  reversing on account of available benefits under  the Income Tax Act, 1961. (Also refer note 26). Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused  tax losses to the extent that it is probable that  taxable profit will be available against which the  losses can be utilised. Significant management  judgement is required to determine the amount  of deferred tax assets that can be recognised,  based upon the likely timing and the level of  future taxable profits together with future tax  planning strategies.   vii)   Income / Revenue Revenue from Operations on account of Force  Majeure / Change in Law events or Interest  Income on account of carrying cost in terms of  Power Purchase Agreements / Supplemental  Power Purchase Agreements with various  State Power Distribution Utilities is accounted  for / recognised by the Company based on best  management estimates following principles  of prudence, as per the orders / reports of  Regulatory Authorities, the Hon’ble Supreme  Court of India (“Hon’ble Supreme Court”) and the  outstanding receivables thereof in the books of  account have been adjusted / may be subject  to adjustments on account of consequential  orders of the respective Regulatory Authorities,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court and final closure  of the matters with the respective Discoms.  (Refer note 34 and 35). In certain cases, the Company has claimed  compensation from the Discoms based on  management’s interpretation of the regulatory  orders and various technical parameters  including provisional methodology for coal cost  recovery, which are subject to final verification  and confirmation by the respective Discoms,  and hence, in these cases, the revenues have  been  recognised  during  various  financial  years / periods, on a prudent basis with  conservative attributable parameters in the  books. The necessary true-up adjustments  for revenue claims (including carrying cost /  delayed payment surcharge) are made in the  books on final acknowledgement / regulatory  orders / settlement of matters with respective  Discoms or eventual recovery of the claims,  whichever is earlier. In case of Udupi TPP, Revenue from sale of power  and other income is recognised upon judgement  by the management for recoverability of the  claims based on the relevant contractual terms  / provisional tariff rates as provided by the  regulator / governing tariff regulations, to the  extent applicable, having regard to mechanism  provided in applicable tariff regulations and  the bilateral arrangement with the customers,  which may be subject to adjustments in  future years, on receipt of final orders of the  respective  Regulatory  Authorities  or  final  closure of the matter with the customers.  (Refer note 34 and 35).   viii)   Classification of Trade Receivables In cases of circumstances / matters where there  are pending litigations on regulatory matters  /  change  in  law  claims,  the  classification  of  disputed / undisputed trade receivables is  a matter of judgement based on facts and  circumstances. The Company has evaluated  the fact pattern and circumstances including  ongoing discussions with the Discoms for  each such regulatory matter pending to be  adjudicated by the relevant authority. 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 383 In cases, where rule of law and principles  of economic restitution have already been  established by APTEL / Supreme Court in  similar matters, the revenues are recognised  on prudent and conservative technical  parameters,  significant  amounts  have  been  recovered already and the management does  not perceive any downside risks in future  on  final  adjudication  by  Supreme  Court  and  settlement of matter with Discoms, the related  receivables are classified as undisputed. In cases, where discussions with Discoms have  not made reasonable progress and matters are  sub-judice, the related receivables are classified  as disputed, even though the management is  reasonably confident of recovering the dues in  full, backed by the regulatory orders in favour  of the Company.   ix)   Mega Power Status One of the thermal power plant has availed  exemption of customs / excise duty in  pursuance to terms of the provisional mega  power  policy  as  notified  by  the  Government  of India. The Company has not recognised for  the reduction in cost to property, plant and  equipment as a grant, pending compliance  of terms of Mega Power Status which  needs to be attained within 156 months, i.e.  September, 2022, from the date of import of  plant and equipment as per approval by the  Ministry of Power ("MoP"), Government of  India vide amendment dated April 07, 2022.  Ministry of Power vide its letter dt. December 19,  2024, has granted proportional Final Mega  Power Certificate to the extent of 71% of the  installed capacity which is tied up under long  term Power Purchase Agreements. For the  balance untied installed capacity of 29%, the  Management  is  confident  to  receive  the  extension to comply with the conditions for  balance capacity.   x)     Applicability  of  Appendix  D  -  Service  Concession  Arrangements  of  Ind  AS  115  Revenue from contracts with customers       The Company has entered into PPAs with  various state DISCOMs for supplying power  for a period upto 25 years from its thermal  power plants (TPP). These TPPs have been  set up on Build-Own-Operate basis with no  transfer of assets at the end of the term of  PPA. The management is of the view that PPA  does not cover the entire life of these power  plants. Further, the DISCOMs does not control  any significant residual interest and does not  restrict the Company's practical ability to  sell or pledge these assets. Accordingly, the  management is of the view that Appendix D to  Ind AS 115 is not applicable to the Company.

(b)   Similarly, in a matter relating to shortfall in availability of domestic coal under New Coal Distribution  Policy (“NCDP”) and Scheme of Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India (“SHAKTI”)  policy of the government, for the Company’s 2500 MW power generation capacity at Tiroda TPP, Hon’ble  Supreme Court vide its orders dated March 03, 2023 and April 20, 2023, upheld the MERC’s orders  dated March 07, 2018 and February 07, 2019, and the APTEL’s orders dated September 14, 2020 and  September 28, 2020 respectively granting compensation (including carrying costs thereon) towards  additional coal cost for the use of alternative coal.      (c)   Based on the various regulatory orders in respect of matters stated in (a) and (b) above, the Company  has continued to recognise tariff compensation claims towards additional coal cost of  `  3,786.20  crore and carrying cost of  `  Nil (including  `  366.26 crore pertaining to earlier years) during the year  ended March 31, 2025 and additional coal cost of  `  4,282.15 crore and carrying cost of  `  190.49 crore  (includes tariff compensation claims of  `  290.19 crore (net of credit of  `  115.72 crore) and carrying cost  of  `  190.49 crore pertaining to earlier years) during the year ended March 31, 2024.         Further, during the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company has also accounted late / delayed payment  surcharge (“LPS”) of  `  367.90 crore (Previous year  `  5,870.81 crore) from Maharashtra State Electricity  Distribution Company Limited (“MSEDCL”), under other income, based on Company’s policy relating to  recognition of late / delayed payment surcharge on acknowledgement or receipt, whichever is earlier.     (d)     Apart from above, in one of the matters relating to cost factor for computation of tariff compensatory  claim, on account of consumption of alternate coal, based on the claim amount billed by the Company,  MSEDCL filed an appeal with APTEL although the Company has favorable tariff compensation order  from MERC dated September 11, 2021 in the matter. APTEL vide its order dated July 09, 2024 dismissed  the appeal filed by MSEDCL. Subsequently, MSEDCL filed an appeal with Hon’ble Supreme Court in the  matter which is pending adjudication. Further, during the year ended March 31, 2024, MSEDCL has also  filed a petition with MERC w.r.t. the interpretation of its earlier order relating to compensation for in- land transportation cost factor for transfer of domestic coal.      Currently, the Company has continued to recognise the compensation claim on best estimate basis  pending settlement of petition and does not expect any adverse outcome in the matter. 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 420 ADANI POWER LIMITED ii)   In case of PPAs governed by section 62 of Electricity Act, 2003, the Company recognises revenue from sale  of power based on the most recent tariff order / provisional tariff approved by the respective Regulatory  Commission, as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (“APTEL”) / Regulatory commissions  and necessary provisions / adjustment considered on conservative basis. This revenue is recognized having  regard to mechanism provided in applicable tariff regulations and the bilateral arrangements with the  Discoms. Such tariff orders are subject to conclusion of final tariff orders in terms of Multiyear Tariff (“MYT”)  Regulations at the end of respective tariff period. iii)   In respect of Kawai TPP   In the matter relating to shortfall in availability of domestic linkage coal, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its  order dated August 31, 2020 has admitted all tariff compensation claims for additional coal costs incurred  for power generation and the Company continues to realise the claim amount towards compensation.   During the previous year, Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Limited (“RUVITL”) (formerly known as Rajasthan  Urja Vikas Nigam Limited) has filed a fresh petition before Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission  (“RERC”) primarily challenging the methodology and operating parameters considered while arriving at the  tariff compensation claim for additional coal cost incurred for power generation by the Company which  had earlier been settled by RUVITL in March, 2022 based on Hon’ble Supreme Court order dated August  31, 2020. The RERC vide its order dated September 01, 2023 dismissed the petition of RUVITL. RUVITL has  now preferred an appeal with APTEL against the ruling of RERC. The Company continues to recognise the  revenue based on the principle as approved in the order passed by the Hon’ble Supreme court.  iv)   In respect of Mundra TPP   (a)     The Company and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (“GUVNL”) had entered into an additional  Supplemental Power Purchase Agreements (“SPPAs”) dated March 30, 2022 to resolve all pending  matter / dispute relating to Bid 1 and Bid 2 Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA / SPPA”), towards supply of  2434 MW of power and thereby approached CERC to determine the base energy tariff rates for power  sales under Bid 1 & Bid 2 SPPAs, with retrospective effect from October 15, 2018, for further submission  to the Government of Gujarat (“GoG”). CERC vide its order dated June 13, 2022 recommended the  base energy tariff rates for final approval of GoG which is still pending as on reporting date. CERC  order allows the Company and GUVNL to mutually agree on adoption of six monthly or monthly CERC  escalation index to apply over base energy tariff rate as on October 2018 as per the provisions of earlier  SPPA dated December 05, 2018 having impact on determination of subsequent period energy rates.    (b)     Pending approval of the base energy tariff rate by GoG and also the mutual agreement between  the Company and GUVNL as regards adoption of monthly / six-monthly CERC escalation index, the  Company has been supplying power to GUVNL based on certain mechanism whereby actual fuel cost  incurred gets pass through in the billing of energy charges, from March 01, 2022 onwards till date  as per understanding with GUVNL for the purpose of additional Supplemental PPA dated March 30,  2022. The Company also realised significant amounts of invoices billed to GUVNL, although there are  certain deductions made by GUVNL which are pending reconciliation / settlement. During the previous  year, the Company received communication from GUVNL seeking refund of  `  1,172.69 crore towards  energy charges on account of adjustment of coal cost in respect of power supplied during October 15,  2018 to March 31, 2023, which was adjusted in the books as a matter of caution, though disputed by  company with GUVNL.       The Company continues to recognise energy charges revenue as per amount billed based on actual  fuel costs since the date of SPPA, pending approval of base energy tariff and agreement between the  Company and GUVNL regarding adoption of method of CERC escalation index, which has impact on the  Company’s energy charges claims, depending on the trend of coal price movement. The escalation index  has positive impact on energy charges as at reporting date but Company continues to invoice energy  charges on actual fuel cost basis. The Company does not expect any adverse outcome in this matter. 34   Revenue from Operations  (Contd...)

The Nominated Authority vide its letter dated  September 17, 2021, had accepted the surrender petition by the Company. The Nominated Authority  concluded  the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on September 13, 2022. Pursuant to this, the Coal Mines Development  and Production Agreement (“CMDPA”) has been signed between the new bidder and the Nominated Authority,  Ministry of Coal on October 13, 2022.    The Nominated Authority, has issued the Final Compensation Order dated November 13, 2024 and the Company  is in process of submitting the required documents with the Nominated Authority, for final settlement and  closure of the matter.  48   The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited (“REL”) had incurred cost of  `  55.57 crore  and  `  30.75 crore towards development of Talabira Coal mine and Ganeshpura Coal mine, respectively in  the earlier years.   In the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon’ble Delhi High Court requesting  surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India’s (“UoI”) notification dated April 16, 2015 stating capping  of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the release of bid  security. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated April 15, 2019 dismissed the petitions on the  ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions before Hon’ble Supreme  Court to set aside the order of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication of the petitions, Hon’ble  Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated May 30, 2019 that no coercive action to be taken  in these matters.   The management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the  entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.   However, the matter has been pending for long period of time, the company based on prudence principles has  fully provided the amount in the books for the purpose of financial reporting. 45   Leases  (Contd...) 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 435 49   The National Green Tribunal ("NGT") in a matter relating to non-compliance of environmental norms relating to  Udupi thermal power plant (“Udupi TPP”) directed the Company vide its order dated March 14, 2019, to make  payment of  `  5.00 crore as an interim environmental compensation to Central Pollution Control Board ("CPCB").    NGT vide its order dated May 31, 2022 directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of  `  47.02 crore.  The Company has recognised expense provision in the books on a conservative basis, although, the Company has  filed an appeal with the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated August 26, 2022 against the above referred NGT order.  The Udupi TPP continues to operate in compliance with all the conditions under Environment Clearance as at  March 31, 2025. 50   (a)     In respect of Mundra TPP, the management believes that on account of resolution of majority of the issues  relating to tariff compensation claim with GUVNL and Haryana Discoms and also on account of execution of  360 MW PPA with MPSEZ Utilities Limited (“MUL”), and certain other factors, Mundra TPP of the Company  would continue to establish profitable operations over a foreseeable future and meet its performance and  financial obligations. During the previous year, the Company has resumed supply of power to Haryana  Discom and consequently has improved its operational performance in terms of achieving Higher Plant load  factor (PLF) and generating positive operating cashflows, hence, based on the assessment of value in use  of Mundra TPP, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its Mundra TPP  related property, plant and equipment aggregating to  `  14,260.35 crore as at March 31, 2025.   (b)     On March 31, 2025, the Company has determined the recoverable amounts of all its thermal power plants  over their useful lives based on the Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) identified, as required under Indian  Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) 36 “Impairment of Assets”, based on the estimates relating to tariff, demand  for power, operational performance of the plants, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels,  exchange variations, inflation, terminal value, climate change impact, etc. which are considered reasonable  by the Management. On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Company has  concluded that the recoverable value of all the thermal power plants is higher than their carrying amounts  including goodwill assigned to each CGU.       On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Company has concluded that the  recoverable value of such CGUs individually is higher than their respective carrying amounts as at March 31,  2025. However, if these estimates and assumptions were to change in future, there could be corresponding  impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants. 51   The Company has taken various derivatives to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on  items including principal loan amount, Trade Credits etc. and interest thereof along with interest rate changes.

The Management  ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Company through appropriate policies and procedures  and the risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk objectives.  All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have appropriate  skills, experience and supervision. It is the company policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes  may be undertaken. The Company's financial liabilities (other than derivatives) comprises mainly of borrowings including interest  accrual, leases, trade, capital and other payables. The Company's financial assets (other than derivatives) comprise  mainly of investments, cash and cash equivalents, other balances with banks, loans, trade and other receivables. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk.   (i)   Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because  of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises four types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk,  commodity risk and equity price risk.     a)   Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate  because of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market  interest rates relates primarily to the part of Company’s debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a mixed portfolio of fixed and variable rate  loans and borrowings.  Significant portion of Company's borrowing is in INR ( ` ) and are borrowed at  fluctuating interest rate.   The sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments  not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has  been carried out on the amount of floating rate liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period.  The year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the  year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably  possible change in interest rates.

The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in  foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s operating activities (trade receivables) and  borrowings in the form of Trade Credits. The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging  transactions that are expected to realise in future. The Company also enters into various foreign  exchange hedging contracts such as forward covers, swaps, options etc. to mitigate the risk arising  out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings and trade payables (including  capital creditors).     Every one percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee  and U.S. dollar on the unhedged exposure of $ 53.50 million as on March 31, 2025 and $ 73.44 million  as on March 31, 2024 would have affected the Company's profit or loss for the year as follows:   ( `  In crore) Particulars For the year ended    March 31, 2025 For the year ended     M a rc h   3 1 ,  2 0 2 4                                     [Restated   (Refer note 43)] Impact on Profit before tax for the year (net of amounts  capitalised under Property, Plant and Equipment)  4.57   6.13  Impact on Equity  3.42   4.58      c)   Commodity price risk   The Company’s exposure to commodity price is affected by a number of factors including the effect  of regulations, the price volatility of coal prices in the market, including imported coal, contract size  and length, market condition etc. which is moderated by optimising the procurement under fuel supply  agreement and getting compensated under long term power purchase agreements and change in law  regulations. In case, the company anticipates non-availability of coal, the same is mitigated by sourcing  imported coal in advance to meet the demand. Its operating / trading activities require the on-going  purchase for continuous supply of coal and other commodities. Therefore the Company monitors its  purchases closely to optimise the procurement cost. 52   Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies :  (Contd...) 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 438 ADANI POWER LIMITED 52   Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies :  (Contd...)     d)   Equity Price risk   The Company does not have equity price risk except to the extent impairment of investment.     (ii)   Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer  contract, leading to a financial loss.     a)   Trade Receivables   The Company is having majority of receivables from State Electricity Boards which are Government  undertakings and have interest clause on delayed payments and hence, they are secured from credit  losses in the future. Receivables are secured by letter of credit amounting to  `  3,777.84 crore (Previous  year  `  3,732.24 crore). Further, the Company holds sovereign guarantee from BPDB for the entire  receivables under Power purchase agreement.      b)   Financial Guarantee   The Company has issued financial guarantees to banks on behalf of and in respect of loan facilities  availed by its subsidiaries. In accordance with the policy of the Company, the Company has recognised  these financial guarantees as liability at fair value (Refer note 24 and 31). Outstanding loans in the  subsidiary against the financial guarantee contracts given by the Company as at March 31, 2025 is  `  950 crore (Previous year  `  Nil).     c)   Other Financial Assets   This comprises of deposit with banks, loans, investments in mutual funds, derivative assets and other  receivables. The company limits its exposure to credit risks arising from these financial assets and there  is no collateral held against these because counter parties are group companies, banks and recognised  financial institutions. Banks and recognised financial institutions have high credit ratings assigned by  credit rating agencies.   (iii)   Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated  with its financial liabilities. The Company monitors its liquidity requirement using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider  the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations. The  Company’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective  and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure. A balance between continuity of funding and  flexibility is maintained through internal accruals as well as adequately adjusting the working capital cycle. Having regard to the nature of the business wherein the Company is able to generate regular cash flows  over a period of time, any surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital  management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and cash equivalents (to the extent  required) and any excess is invested in highly liquid mutual funds with appropriate maturities to optimise  the cash returns on investments while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities; or lent to group  entities (within Adani Power Limited) at market determined interest rate. Read with note 54, the Company expects to generate positive cash flows from operations in order to meet  its external financial liabilities as they fall due and also consistently monitors funding options available in  the debt and capital market with a view to maintain financial flexibility.

Asset Liability Matching Strategies The  Company  has  funded  benefit  plan  and  have  purchased  insurance  policy,  which  is  basically  a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is  guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment  of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy).  The policy thus, mitigates the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of  assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in  interest rate, which can result in a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the funded  asset wherever applicable.       x.   Effect of Plan on Entity's Future Cash Flows a)    Funding arrangements and Funding Policy     The Company have purchased an insurance policies to provide for payment of gratuity to the  employees. Every year, the insurance company carries out a funding valuation based on the latest  employee data provided by these Companies.

Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of these consolidated  financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. •   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section  143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for  expressing our opinion on whether the Holding  Company has adequate internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements in place and  the operating effectiveness of such controls. •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management. •   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s  use of the going concern basis of accounting and,  based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  ability of the Group to continue as a going concern.  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 481 If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report to the related disclosures in the consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Group to cease to  continue as a going concern. •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the consolidated financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. •   Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities or business activities within the Group  of which we are the independent auditors and  whose  financial  information  we  have  audited,  to  express an opinion on the consolidated financial  statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audit of the  financial statements of such entities included in  the consolidated financial statements of which we  are the independent auditors. For the other entities  included in the consolidated financial statements,  which have been audited by other auditors, such  other auditors remain responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audits carried  out by them. We remain solely responsible for  our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance of  the Holding Company and such other entities included in  the consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent auditors regarding, among other matters,  the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  financial  year  ended  March 31, 2025 and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless  law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication. Other Matters (a)   We did not audit the financial statements and other  financial  information,  in  respect  of  sixteen  (16)  subsidiaries,  whose  financial  statements  include  total assets of  `  18,044.62 crore as at March 31,  2025, and total revenues of  `  2,502.02 crore and net  cash outflows of  `  (90.20) crore for the year ended  on that date. These financial statement and other  financial information have been audited by other  auditors, which financial statements, other financial  information and auditor’s reports have been  furnished to us by the management. Our opinion on  the consolidated financial statements, in so far as  it relates to the amounts and disclosures included  in respect of these subsidiaries and our report in  terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act,  in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is  based solely on the report(s) of such other auditors.   Certain of these subsidiaries are located outside  India whose financial statements and other financial  information have been prepared in accordance with  accounting principles generally accepted in their  respective countries and which have been audited  by other auditors under generally accepted auditing  standards applicable in their respective countries.  The Holding Company’s management has converted  the financial statements of such subsidiaries located  outside India from accounting principles generally  accepted in their respective countries to accounting  principles generally accepted in India. We have  audited these conversion adjustments made by  the Holding Company’s management. Our opinion  in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs  of such subsidiaries located outside India is based  on the report of other auditors and the conversion  adjustments prepared by the management of the  Holding Company and audited by us.   Our  opinion  above  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements, and our report on Other Legal and  Regulatory  Requirements  below,  is  not  modified  in respect of the above matters with respect to  our reliance on the work done and the reports of  the  other  auditors  and  the  financial  statements  and  other  financial  information  certified  by  the Management.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 486 ADANI POWER LIMITED Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the  Consolidated Financial Statements of Adani Power Limited Report  on  the  Internal  Financial  Controls  under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section  143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated  financial statements of Adani Power Limited (hereinafter  referred to as the “Holding Company”) as of and for  the year ended March 31, 2025, we have audited the  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements of the Holding Company and its  subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries  together referred to as “the Group”) which are companies  incorporated in India, as of that date. Management’s  Responsibility  for  Internal  Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the companies  included in the Group which are companies incorporated  in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal control  over  financial  reporting  criteria  established  by  the  Holding Company considering the essential components  of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial  controls  that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,  including adherence to the respective company’s  policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention  and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required  under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding  Company’s  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and  the  Standards  on  Auditing,  specified  under  section  143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit  of  internal  financial  controls,  both,  issued  by  ICAI.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements was established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial statements and their operating effectiveness.  Our audit of internal financial controls with reference  to consolidated financial statements included obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and  the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms  of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements. Meaning  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  With  Reference  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements is a process designed  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial  statements  includes  those  policies  and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance  that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that  receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorisations of management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  

Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 487 of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the financial statements. Inherent  Limitations  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  With  Reference  to  Consolidated  Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial controls with reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, the Group, which are companies  incorporated  in  India  whose  financial  statements  are  audited, have, maintained in all material respects,    adequate internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated  financial  statements  and  such  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  were  operating  effectively  as  at  March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over   financial reporting criteria established by the Holding  Company considering the essential components  of internal control stated in the Guidance Note  issued by the ICAI. Other Matters Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the  adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Holding  Company,  in  so  far as it relates to the fourteen subsidiaries which  are companies incorporated in India, is based on the  corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries  incorporated in India.

The  consolidated  financial  statements  were  approved for issue in accordance with a resolution  of the directors on April 30, 2025. 2   Material accounting policies 2.1   Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group  have been prepared in accordance with Indian  Accounting  Standards  (Ind  AS)  notified  under  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) read  with section 133 of Companies Act, 2013 and  presentation requirements of Division II of schedule  III to the Companies Act, 2013 (Ind AS compliant  Schedule III), on the historical cost basis except  for following assets and liabilities which have been  measured at fair value. i.   Derivative Financial Instruments ii.   Certain financial assets The  Group’s  consolidated  financial  statements  are presented in INR ( ` ), which is also the parent  Company’s functional currency and all values  are rounded to the nearest crore, except when  otherwise indicated. Amounts less than  `  50,000  have been presented as "*". 2.2   Basis of consolidation   Subsidiaries The  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the financial statements of the Company and its  subsidiaries, being the entities controlled by it as at  March 31, 2025. Control is achieved when the Group : •     has power over the investee (i.e. existing rights  that give it the current ability to direct the  relevant activities of the investee); •     is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns  from its involvement with the investee; and •     has the ability to use its power over the investee  to affect its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls  an investee if facts and circumstances indicate  that there are changes to one or more of the three  elements of control listed above. When the Company has less than a majority of the  voting rights of an investee, it has power over the  investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give  it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities  of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers  all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing  whether or not the Company voting rights in an  investee are sufficient to give it power, including: •     the size of the Group's holding of voting rights  relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of  the other vote holders; •     potential voting rights held by the Group, other  vote holders or other parties; •    rights arising from other contractual  arrangements; and •     The contractual arrangement with the other  vote holders of the investee. •     any additional facts and circumstances that  indicate that the Group has, or does not

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the  Group obtains control over the subsidiary and  ceases when the Group loses control of the  subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses  of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the  year  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements from the date the Group gains control  until the date when the Group ceases to control  the subsidiary. Consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  using uniform accounting policies for like  transactions and other events in similar  circumstances. If a member of the Group uses  accounting policies other than those adopted  in the consolidated financial statements for like  transactions and events in similar circumstances,  appropriate adjustments are made to that Group  member’s  financial  statements  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements  to  ensure  conformity with the Group’s accounting policies. The  financial  statements  of  all  entities  used  for  the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same  reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e.  year ended on March 31. Consolidated financial statements present assets,  liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows  of the parent and its subsidiaries as those of a single  economic entity. In preparing these consolidated  financial  statements,  all  intragroup  assets  and  liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows  relating to transactions between members of the  Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. Profit  or  loss  and  each  component  of  other  comprehensive income or loss are attributed to  the owners of the  Parent Company and to the  non-controlling interests even if this results in the  non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.     Changes in the Group's ownership interests in  existing subsidiaries Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in  subsidiaries that do not result in the Group's losing  control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as  equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the  Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests  are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative  interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference  between the amount by which the non-controlling  interests are adjusted and the fair value of the  consideration paid or received is recognised  directly in equity and attributed to owners of the  Parent Company. When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a  gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is  calculated as the difference between (i) the  aggregate of the fair value of the consideration  received and the fair value of any retained interest  and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets  (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary  and any non-controlling interests. All amounts  previously recognised in other comprehensive  income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted  for as if the Group had directly disposed of the  related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e.  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  or  transferred  to  another category of equity as specified/permitted  by applicable Ind AS). 2.3   Summary of material accounting policies   a     Property, Plant and Equipment and Capital  Work-In-Progress     Recognition and initial measurement Property, plant and equipment   are stated at  original / acquisition cost grossed up with the  amount  of  tax  /  duty  benefits  availed,  less  accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any. All directly  attributable costs relating to the project  activities, including borrowing costs relating  to qualifying assets incurred during the project  development period, net of income earned  during the period till commercial operation  date of the project, are recorded as project  expenses and disclosed as a part of Capital  Work-in-Progress. Properties / projects in the  course of construction are carried at cost, less  any recognised impairment losses. When significant parts of plant and equipment  are required to be replaced at intervals, the  Group depreciates them separately based on  their specific useful lives. Freehold land are carried at historical cost less  accumulated impairment losses, if any. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 497 Payments / provision towards compensation,  rehabilitation and resettlement ("R&R")  activities and other expenses relatable to land  in possession are treated as cost of freehold  land. Provision for R&R costs are provided at  the present value of expected costs to settle  the obligation using estimated cash flows and  are recognised as part of the cost of the land.  The cash flows are discounted at a current  pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to  the R&R liability. The unwinding of the discount  as well as payments made/adjustments is  expensed as incurred cost and recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.  The estimated future costs of R&R are reviewed  annually and adjusted as appropriate. Items of stores and spares that meet the  definition  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are capitalised at cost and depreciated over  their useful life.     Depreciation     In respect of Property, Plant and Equipment  covered under part A of Schedule II to  the Companies Act, 2013, depreciation is  recognised based on the cost of assets (other  than freehold land) less their residual values  over their useful lives, using the straight-line  method in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss unless such expenditure forms part of  carrying value of another asset. The useful life  of property, plant and equipment is considered  based on life prescribed in schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 except in case of power  plant assets, where the life has been estimated  at 25 years or 40 years based on technical  assessment, taking into account, the estimated  usage of the assets and the current operating  condition of the assets. The management  believes that these estimated useful lives are  realistic and reflect fair approximation of the  period over which the assets are likely to be  used. The estimated useful lives, residual values  and depreciation method are reviewed at the  end of each reporting period, with the effect  of any changes in estimate accounted for on a  prospective basis.       Major inspection / overhauling including  turnaround and maintenance cost are  depreciated over the period of 5 years. All other  repair and maintenance costs are recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss  as incurred.       Assets class wise useful life of the Property,  Plant and Equipment (except for Udupi Thermal  Power Plant ("Udupi TPP"), are mentioned  below : Assets Class Useful life   (in years) Right of Use Assets - lower of  lease term or useful life 3 to 99 Buildings - Township, Hostels,  Residential flats etc. 60 Buildings - Plant offices,  Boundary walls, Civil works etc. 30 Buildings - Others 3 to 42 Plant and Equipment - Capital  Overhauling and Others 2 to 6 Plant and Equipment -  Desalination and Flue Gas  Desulfurisation, Cooling Tower  and Ancillary Tower 7 to 20 Plant and Equipment - Boiler,  Turbine and Generators 12 to 40 Furniture and Fixtures 1 to 10 Railway Sidings 5 to 15 Computer Hardware 3 to 6 Office Equipment 3 to 5 Vehicles - Four and Two  Wheelers 8 to 10 Vehicles - Others 3 to 25 In respect of Property, Plant and Equipment  covered under part B of Schedule II to  the Companies Act, 2013, depreciation is  recognised based on the cost of Property, Plant  and Equipment (other than freehold land) at  the rates as well as methodology notified by  the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  (''CERC") (Terms and Conditions of Tariff)  Regulations, 2019 in the consolidated statement  of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms  part of carrying value of another asset under  construction mainly in respect of Udupi TPP.  In case of assets with useful life lesser than the  Power Plant project life, the useful life of these  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 498 ADANI POWER LIMITED assets has been considered for the purpose of  calculation of depreciation as per the provisions  of the Companies Act, 2013 and subsequent  amendments thereto. In case of Udupi TPP, Property, Plant and  Equipment class wise depreciation rates are  mentioned below : Assets Class (In %) Right of Use Assets - lower of  lease term or useful life  5.00 to  20.00 Buildings - Temporary  Structures  20.00 to  25.00 Buildings - Others 3.34 Plant and Equipment - Boiler,  Turbine and Generator 5.28 Plant and Equipment - Capital  Overhauling 20.00 Furniture and Fixtures 6.33 Computer Hardware 15.00 Office Equipment 6.33 Vehicles 9.50    Subsequent  measurement      Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s  carrying amount or recognised as a separate  asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with  the item will flow to the Group and the cost of  the item can be measured reliably. The carrying  amount of any component accounted for as a  separate asset is derecognised when replaced.  All other repairs and maintenance are charged  to  profit  or  loss  during  the  reporting  period  in which they are incurred. Subsequent costs  are depreciated over the residual life of the  respective assets. The residual values, useful  lives and methods of depreciation of property,  plant and equipment are reviewed at each  financial year end and adjusted prospectively,  if appropriate.     De-recognition     An item of property, plant and equipment  and any significant part initially recognised is  derecognised upon disposal or when no future  economic benefits are expected to arise from  the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss  arising on the disposal or retirement of an item  of property, plant and equipment is determined  as the difference between the sales proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset and is  recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss.   b   Investment properties     Recognition and initial measurement Investment properties comprises of land are  held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation,  or both. Investment properties held under  a  lease  is  classified  as  investment  property  when it is held to earn rentals or for capital  appreciation or both. Investment properties are  measured initially at their cost of acquisition,  including transaction costs. The cost comprises  purchase price, borrowing cost if capitalisation  criteria are met and directly attributable cost  of bringing the asset to its working condition  for the intended use. Any trade discount  and rebates are deducted in arriving at the  purchase price. Subsequent costs are included  in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised  as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when  it is probable that future economic benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Group.  All other repair and maintenance costs are  recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss as incurred. Though the Group measures investment  property using cost-based measurement, the  fair value of investment property is disclosed  in the notes. Fair values are determined  based on an annual valuation performed  by an accredited external independent  valuer who holds a recognised and relevant  professional qualification.       Subsequent measurement (depreciation and  useful lives) Depreciation on investment properties is  provided on the straight-line method, computed  on the basis of useful lives prescribed in  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.  In case of leasehold properties, the same is  depreciated over the lease term or useful life  whichever is lower. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 499     De-recognition Investment properties are derecognised either  when they have been disposed of or when  they are permanently withdrawn from use and  no future economic benefit is expected from  their disposal. The difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount  of the asset is recognised as other operating  income in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss in the period of de-recognition.   c   Current versus non-current classification The operating cycle is the time between the  acquisition of assets for processing and their  realisation in cash and cash equivalents.  The  Group  has  identified  twelve  months  as  its operating cycle for determining current  and  non-current  classification  of  assets  and  liabilities in the Balance sheet. Deferred Tax Assets and liabilities are classified  as non-current assets and liabilities.   d   Financial Instruments A Financial Instrument is any contract that  gives  rise  to  a  financial  asset  of  one  entity  and a financial liability or equity instrument of  another entity. Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are initially measured at fair value with the   exception of trade receivables that do not  contain  significant  financing  component  or  for which the Group has applied the practical  expedient. The Group initially measures a  financial  asset  at  its  fair  value  plus,  in  the  case  of  a  financial  asset  not  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  the  transaction  cost.  Transaction costs that are directly attributable  to the acquisition or issue of financial assets   and  financial  liabilities  (other  than  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss)  are  added  to  or  deducted from the fair value of the financial  assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on  initial recognition. Transaction costs directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  financial  assets or financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss are recognised immediately in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.   e   Financial assets     Initial recognition and measurement All regular way purchases or sales of financial  assets, that require delivery of assets within  a time frame established by regulation or  convention in the market place (regular way  trades) are recognised and derecognised on a  trade date basis i.e. the date that the Group  commits to purchase or sell the assets.    Subsequent  measurement All recognised financial assets are subsequently  measured in their entirety at either amortised  cost or fair value, depending on the classification  of the financial assets.     Classification of Financial assets     Financial assets measured at amortised cost Financial assets that meet the criteria for  subsequent measurement at amortised cost  are measured using effective interest method  ("EIR") (except for debt instruments that are  designated as at fair value through profit or  loss on initial recognition); a)     the asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets in order  to collect contractual cash flows; and b)     Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding. Amortised cost is calculated by taking  into account any discount or premium on  acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral  part of the EIR.       Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI) Financial assets that meet the criteria for initial  recognition at FVTOCI are remeasured at fair  value at the end of each reporting date through  other comprehensive income (OCI) ; a)     The objective of the business model  is achieved both by collecting  contractual cash flows and selling the  financial assets, and 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 500 ADANI POWER LIMITED b)     The contractual terms of the asset that  give  rise  on  specified  dates  to  cash  flows that represent solely payment of  principal and interest.       Financial assets at fair value through profit or  loss (FVTPL) Financial assets that do not meet the amortised  cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria are remeasured  at fair value at the end of each reporting date  through profit and loss.     Impairment of Financial assets The Group applies the expected credit loss  model for recognising impairment loss on  financial assets measured at amortised cost,  trade receivables and other contractual rights  to receive cash or other financial asset.   The Group measures the loss allowance for  a Trade Receivables and Contract Assets by  following  ‘simplified  approach’  at  an  amount  equal to the lifetime expected credit losses  ("ECL").  In  case  of  other  financial  assets  12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment  loss and where credit risk has increased  significantly, lifetime ECL is used.     Derecognition of financial assets On  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset  in  its entirety, the difference between the  asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the  consideration received and receivable and the  cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised  in consolidated other comprehensive income  and accumulated in equity, is recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss  if such gain or loss would have otherwise been  recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss on disposal of that financial asset.   f   Financial liabilities and equity instruments     Classification as debt or equity Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group  are classified as either financial liabilities or as  equity in accordance with the substance of the  contractual arrangements and the definitions  of a financial liability and an equity instrument.  Compound financial instruments are separated  into liability and equity components based on  the terms of the contract.     Instrument entirely Equity in nature Unsecured perpetual securities (“securities”)  are  the  securities  with  no  fixed  maturity  or  redemption and the same are callable only  at the option of issuer. These securities are  ranked senior only to the equity share capital  of the Parent Company and the issuer does  not have any redemption obligation hence  these securities are recognised as equity as  per Ind AS 32.        Financial liabilities     Initial recognition and measurement All financial liabilities are recognised initially at  fair value and in the case of financial liabilities  at amortised cost, net of directly attributable  transaction costs.     Subsequent Measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement,  financial  liabilities  are  classified  under  two categories: •    Financial liabilities at fair value  through profit or loss •   Financial liabilities at amortised cost     Classification of Financial liabilities       Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or  loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for  trading  and  financial  liabilities  designated  upon initial recognition at fair value through  profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified  as held for trading if these are incurred for  the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.  This category also includes derivative financial  instruments entered into by the Group that  are not designated as hedging instruments in  hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are  recognised in the profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial  recognition at fair value through profit or loss  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 501 are designated as such at the initial date of  recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109  are satisfied. Subsequent changes in fair value  of liabilities are recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss. Fair values are determined in the manner  described in note 'm'.     Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Financial liabilities that are not held-for- trading and are not designated as at FVTPL  are measured at amortised cost at the end of  subsequent accounting periods. The carrying  amounts  of  financial  liabilities  that  are  subsequently measured at amortised cost are  determined based on the effective interest  method. Interest expense that is not capitalised  as part of costs of an asset is included in the  'Finance costs' line item in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss.     Derecognition of financial liabilities On derecognition, the difference between  the carrying amount of the financial liability  derecognised and the consideration paid /  payable is recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss.  In  case  of  derecognition  of  financial  liabilities  relating  to promoters contribution, the difference  between the carrying amount of the financial  liability derecognised and the consideration  paid / payable is recognised in other equity.     Offsetting of Financial Instruments Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  offset and the net amount is reported in the  balance sheet if there is a legally enforceable  right (not contingent on future events) to  off-set the recognised amounts and there is an  intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the  assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.   g   Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into a variety of derivative  financial instruments to manage its exposure  to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks  on borrowings / purchases, including foreign  exchange forward contracts, interest rate  swaps and cross currency swaps, Principal only  Swap, coupon only swap etc. Further details  of  derivatives  financial  instruments  are  disclosed in note 56. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value  at the date the derivative contracts are entered  into and are subsequently remeasured to their  fair value at the end of each reporting period.  Derivatives  are  carried  as  financial  assets  when the fair value is positive and as financial  liabilities when the fair value is negative.  The resulting gain or loss is recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss  immediately, except for the effective portion  of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in  OCI and later reclassified to the consolidated  statement of profit and loss.   h   Hedge Accounting The Group designates certain hedging  instruments, which mainly includes derivatives  in respect of foreign currency risk, as  cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship,  the Group formally designates and documents  the relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item, along with its  risk management objectives and its strategy  for undertaking various hedge transactions.  Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge  and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents  whether the hedging instrument is highly  effective in offsetting changes in fair value or  cash flows of the hedged item attributable to  the hedged risk.     Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward currency contracts as  hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk  in forecast transactions and firm commitments.  The Group designates only the spot element of  a forward contract as a hedging instrument.  The forward element is recognised in  OCI. The ineffective portion relating to  foreign currency contracts is recognised  in finance costs.   i   Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net  realisable value after providing for obsolescence  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 502 ADANI POWER LIMITED and other losses where considered necessary.  Costs include all non-refundable duties and  all charges incurred in bringing the goods to  their present location and condition. Cost is  determined on First in First out basis (FIFO) for  coal inventory and on weighted average basis  for other than coal inventory. Net realisable  value represents estimated selling price of  inventories and in case of coal inventory, it also  includes the tariff price recoverable from supply  of power generated from usage of coal less all  estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Stores and Spares which do not meet the  definition of property, plant and equipment are  accounted as inventories.   j   Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet  comprise cash at banks and on hand and  short-term deposits with an original maturity of  three months or less, that are readily convertible  to a known amount of cash and subject to an  insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the consolidated statement  of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist  of  cash  and  short-term  deposits,  as  defined  above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as  they are considered an integral part of the  Group’s cash management.   k   Business combinations and Goodwill Acquisitions of business are accounted  for using the acquisition method except  business combination under common control.  The consideration transferred in a business  combination is measured at fair value, which is  calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair  values of the assets transferred by the Group,  liabilities incurred by the Group to the former  owners of the acquiree and the equity interest  issued by the Group in exchange of control  of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are  charged to the consolidated statement of profit  and loss for the periods in which the costs are  incurred and the services are received, with the  exception of the costs of issuing debt or equity  securities that are recognised in accordance  with Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 109. Where  the  fair  values  of  the  identifiable  assets and liabilities exceed the purchase  consideration, the Group re-assesses whether  it  has  correctly  identified  all  of  the  assets  acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and  reviews the procedures used to measure the  amounts to be recognised at the acquisition  date. If the reassessment still results in  an excess of the fair value of net assets  acquired over the aggregate consideration  transferred, then the gain is recognised in other  comprehensive income and accumulated in  equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no  clear evidence of bargain purchase, the Group  recognises the gain directly in equity as capital  reserve, without routing the same through  other comprehensive income. If the initial accounting for a business  combination is incomplete by the end of the  reporting period in which the combination  occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts  for the items for which the accounting is  incomplete. Those provisional amounts are  adjusted through Capital Reserve / goodwill  during the measurement period, or additional  assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect  new information obtained about facts and  circumstances that existed at the acquisition  date that, if known, would have affected  the amounts recognised at that date.  These adjustments are called as measurement  period adjustments. The measurement  period does not exceed one year from the  acquisition date. Purchase consideration paid in excess /  shortfall of the fair value of identifiable assets  and liabilities including contingent liabilities  and contingent assets, is recognised as  goodwill / capital reserve respectively, except in  case where different accounting treatment is  specified in the court / National Company Law  Tribunal ("NCLT") approved scheme. However, the following assets and liabilities  acquired in a business combination are  measured at the basis indicated below: •     Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and  liabilities or assets related to employee  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 503 benefits arrangements are recognised and  measured in accordance with Ind AS 12  “Income Taxes” and Ind AS 19 “Employee  Benefits” respectively. •     Potential tax effects of temporary  differences and carry forwards of an  acquiree that exist at the acquisition date  or arise as a result of the acquisition are  accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12. Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business  is carried at cost as established at the date of  acquisition of the business less accumulated  impairment losses, if any. For the purposes of impairment testing,  goodwill is allocated to each of the  Group's cash-generating units (or group of  cash-generating units) that is expected to  benefit from the synergies of the combination. A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has  been allocated is tested for impairment annually,  or more frequently when there is an indication  that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable  amount of the cash-generating unit is less than  its carrying amount, the impairment loss is  allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of  any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to  the other assets of the unit pro rata based on  the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.  Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised  directly in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss. An impairment loss recognised for  goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. On disposal of the relevant cash-generating  unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is  included in the determination of the profit or  loss on disposal.   l   Foreign currency translations and transactions In preparing the financial statements of the  Group, transactions in currencies other than  the entity’s functional currency are recognised  at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of  the transactions. At the end of each reporting  period, monetary items denominated in foreign  currencies are retranslated at the rates  prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items  that are measured in terms of historical cost in  a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in which they arise except for exchange  differences on foreign currency borrowings  relating to assets under construction for future  productive use, which are included in the cost  of those assets when they are regarded as an  adjustment to interest costs on those foreign  currency borrowings. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of  foreign operations are translated into INR at  the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting  date and their statements of profit and loss  are translated at exchange rates prevailing at  the dates of the transactions. The exchange  differences arising on translation for  consolidation are recognised in Other Equity. The Group has elected to continue the  policy adopted for accounting for exchange  differences arising from translation of  long-term foreign currency monetary items  outstanding  and  recognised  in  the  financial  statements for the period ending immediately  before  the  beginning  of  the  first  Ind  AS  financial reporting period i.e. March 31, 2016 as  per the previous GAAP.   m   Fair value measurement The  Group  measures  financial  instruments,  such as, derivatives and mutual funds at fair  value at each balance sheet date.  The Group’s management determines the  policies and procedures for both recurring  fair value measurement, such as derivative  instruments  and  unquoted  financial  assets  measured at fair value. The Group uses valuation techniques that  are appropriate in the circumstances and for  which sufficient data are available to measure  fair value, maximising the use of relevant  observable inputs and minimising the use of  unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value  is  measured  or  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements are categorised within the fair  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 504 ADANI POWER LIMITED value hierarchy, described as follows, based on  the lowest level input that is significant to the  fair value measurement as a whole : -     External valuers are involved for valuation  of  significant  assets,  such  as  unquoted  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  and derivatives. -     For assets and liabilities that are  recognised in the financial statements on  a recurring basis, the Group determines  whether transfers have occurred between  levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing  categorisation (based on the lowest level  input that is significant to the fair value  measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures,  the Group has determined classes of assets  and liabilities on the basis of the nature,  characteristics and risks of the asset or liability  and the level of the fair value hierarchy as  explained above.   n   Government grants The Group recognises government grants only  when there is reasonable assurance that grant  will be received, and all the attached conditions  will be complied with. Where Government  grants relates to non-monetary assets, the cost  of assets is presented at gross value and grant  significantly complied thereon is recognised as  income in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss over the useful life of the related assets  in proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants related to income are recognised in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss in the  same period as the related cost which they are  intended to compensate are accounted for.   o   Contract Balances     Contract assets A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Group performs by  transferring goods or services to a customer  before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that  is conditional. Contract assets are subject to  impairment assessment.     Trade receivables A receivable represents the Group’s right to an  amount of consideration that is unconditional  i.e. only the passage of time is required before  payment of consideration is due and the  amount is billable.      Contract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which the  Group has received consideration from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as  revenue when the Group performs obligations  under the contract.   p   Revenue recognition Revenue from contracts with customers is  recognised when control of the goods or  services are transferred to the customer at an  amount that reflects the consideration to which  the Group expects to be entitled in exchange  for those goods or services. Revenue is measured based on the transaction  price, which is the consideration, adjusted  for discounts and other incentives, if any, as  specified in the contract with the customer.  Revenue also excludes taxes or other amounts  collected from customers. The  disclosure  of  significant  accounting  judgements, estimates and assumptions  relating to revenue from contracts with  customers are provided in Note 3 (vi). The  specific  recognition  criteria  described  below must also be met before revenue  is recognised.       i)   Revenue from Power Supply The Group’s contracts with customers for  the sale of electricity generally include  one performance obligation. The Group  has concluded that revenue from sale of  electricity should be recognised at the  point in time when electricity is transferred  to the customer. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 505 The group has generally concluded that it  is principal in its revenue arrangements.  However, where the group is acting as  an agent, the group recognises revenue  at the net amount that is retained for  these arrangements. Revenue from operations on account of  Force Majeure events / change in law  events in terms of PPAs / SPPAs with  customers (Power Distribution Utilities) is  accounted for by the Group based on the  orders / reports of Regulatory Authorities,  best management estimates, wherever  needed and reasonable certainty to expect  ultimate collection. In case of PPA under section 62 of  Electricity Act, 2003, revenue from sale  of power is recognised based on the most  recent tariff order approved by the CERC,  as  modified  by  the  orders  of  Appellate  Tribunal for Electricity ("APTEL"), to  the extent applicable, having regard to  mechanism provided in applicable tariff  regulations and the bilateral arrangements  with the customers. Where the tariff rates  are yet to be approved, provisional rates  are adopted considering the applicable  CERC Tariff Regulations.     ii)   Sale of traded goods and fly ash     Revenue from the sale of traded goods and  fly ash is recognised at the point in time  when control of the goods is transferred to  the customers, which generally coincides  with the delivery of goods. iii)    Carrying cost in respect of claims for  change in law of taxes and duties,  additional cost incurred on procurement  of alternative coal and on other claims  are recognised upon approval by relevant  regulatory authorities, best management  estimates and based on reasonable  certainty to expect ultimate collection. iv)     Interest income is recognised on time  proportion basis at the effective interest  rate (“EIR”) applicable. v)    Late payment surcharge on delayed  payment for power supply is recognised  based on receipt / collection from customers  or on acceptance / acknowledgement by  the customers whichever is earlier.   q   Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of  qualifying assets, that necessarily take a  substantial period of time to get ready for their  intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of  the cost of the asset, until such time as the  assets are substantially ready for their intended  use or sale. Interest income earned on the  temporary investment of specific borrowings  pending their expenditure on qualifying assets  is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible  for capitalisation. All other borrowing costs are recognised in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss in the period in which they are incurred.  Borrowing cost consist of interest and other  costs that an entity incurs in connection with  the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also  includes exchange differences arising from  foreign currency borrowing.   r   Employee benefits     i)   Defined benefit plans: The Group has obligations towards  gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan  covering eligible employees (in some cases  funded through Group Gratuity Scheme  of Life Insurance Corporation of India).  The Group accounts for the liability for  the  gratuity  benefits  payable  in  future  and  its  classifications  between  current  and non-current liabilities are based on an  independent actuarial valuation carried  out using Projected Unit Credit Method. Defined  benefit  costs  in  the  nature  of  current and past service cost and net  interest expense or income are recognised  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and loss in the period in which they occur.  Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial  gains and losses, the effect of changes  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 506 ADANI POWER LIMITED to the asset ceiling (excluding amounts  included in net interest or the net defined  benefit  liability)  and  the  return  on  plan  assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest on the net defined benefit liability)  are recognised immediately in the balance  sheet with corresponding debit or credit  to retained earnings through OCI in the  period in which it occurs. Remeasurement  are  not  classified  to  the  consolidated  statement of profit and loss in subsequent  periods. Past service cost is recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and  loss in the period of a plan amendment.     ii)   Defined contribution plan: Retirement  Benefits  in  the  form  of  Provident Fund and Family Pension Fund  which are defined contribution schemes  are charged to the consolidated statement  of profit and loss for the period in which  the contributions to the respective funds  accrue as per relevant statues.     iii)   Compensated Absences: Provision for Compensated Absences  and  its  classifications  between  current  and non-current liabilities are based  on independent actuarial valuation.  The actuarial valuation is done as per the  projected unit credit method as at the  reporting date.     iv)   Short term employee benefits:     These are recognised at an undiscounted  amount in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss for the year in which the  related services are rendered.   s   Leases The Group assesses at contract inception  whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.  That is, if the contract conveys the right to  control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset  for  a  period of time in exchange for consideration.     The Group as lessee The Group recognises right-of-use assets  and lease liabilities for all leases except for  short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group applies the available practical  expedients wherein it:   y Uses a single discount rate to a portfolio  of leases with reasonably similar  characteristics   y Relies on its assessment of whether leases  are onerous immediately before the date  of initial application   y Applies the short-term leases exemptions  to leases with lease term that ends within  12 months at the date of initial application   y Excludes the initial direct costs from the  measurement of the right-of-use asset at  the date of initial application   y Uses hindsight in determining the lease  term where the contract contains options  to extend or terminate the lease    Right-of-use  assets The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the  commencement date of the lease. (i.e., the date  the underlying asset is available for use) The cost of right-of-use assets includes the  amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial  direct costs incurred, and lease payments made  at or before the commencement date less any  lease incentives received. Refer note (a) for  useful life of right of use assets. The right-of-use assets are also subject to  impairment. Refer note (x) for impairment of  non-financial assets.    Lease  liabilities The Group records the lease liabilities at  the present value of the lease payments  discounted at the incremental borrowing rate  at the date of initial application and right of use  asset at an amount equal to the lease liabilities  adjusted for any prepayments recognised in  the balance sheet. The lease payments include  fixed payments (including in substance fixed  payments) less any lease incentives receivable,  variable lease payments that depend on an  index or a rate, and amounts expected to  be paid under residual value guarantees.  The lease payments also include the exercise  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 507 price of a purchase option reasonably certain  to be exercised by the Group and payments of  penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease  term reflects the Group exercising the option  to terminate. Variable lease payments that do  not depend on an index or a rate are recognised  as expenses in the period in which the event or  condition that triggers the payment occurs.     Subsequent measurement of lease liabilities The lease liabilities is remeasured when there  is change in future lease payments arising  from a change in an index or a rate, or a  change in the estimate of the guaranteed  residual value, or a change in the assessment  of purchase, extension or termination option.  When the lease liabilities is measured, the  corresponding adjustment is reflected in the  right-of-use assets.   t   Taxes on Income Tax expenses comprises current tax and  deferred tax. These are recognised in the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss  except to the extent that it relates to a business  combination, or items recognised directly in  equity or in other comprehensive income.    Current  tax Tax on income for the current period is  determined on the basis of estimated taxable  income and tax credits computed in accordance  with the provisions of the relevant tax laws and  based on the expected outcome of assessments  / appeals. Current income tax assets and  liabilities are measured at the amount expected  to be recovered from or paid to the taxation  authorities. Management periodically evaluates  positions taken in the tax returns with respect  to situations in which applicable tax regulations  are subject to interpretation and establishes  provisions where appropriate. Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  outside  profit or loss (either in other comprehensive  income or in equity). Current tax items are  recognised in correlation to the underlying  transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.  Management periodically evaluates positions  taken in the tax returns with respect to  situations in which applicable tax regulations  are subject to interpretation and establishes  provisions where appropriate.    Deferred  tax Deferred tax is recognised for the future  tax consequences of deductible temporary  differences between the carrying values of  assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases at the reporting date. Deferred tax  liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable  temporary differences except when the deferred  tax liability arises at the time of transaction that  affects neither the accounting profit or loss  nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets  are generally recognised for all deductible  temporary differences, carry forward of unused  tax credits and any unused tax losses, to the  extent that it is probable that future taxable  income will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and carry  forward of unused tax credit and unused tax  losses can be utilised, except when the deferred  tax asset relating to temporary differences  arising at the time of transaction affects neither  the accounting profit or loss nor the taxable  profit or loss. The carrying amount of deferred  tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date  and reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that sufficient taxable profit will be  available to allow all or part of the deferred tax  asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax  assets are re-assessed at each reporting date  and are recognised to the extent that it has  become  probable  that  future  taxable  profits  will allow the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Deferred tax relating to items recognised  outside the consolidated statement of profit  and loss is recognised outside the consolidated  statement of profit and loss (either in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity).  Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation  to the underlying transaction either in OCI or  directly in equity. The Group offsets deferred tax assets and  deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally  enforceable right to set off current tax assets  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 508 ADANI POWER LIMITED and current tax liabilities and the deferred  tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate  to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority on the same taxable entity which  intend either to settle current tax liabilities and  assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets  and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each  future period in which significant amounts of  deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to  be settled or recovered. When there is uncertainty regarding income  tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a  tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax  treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority  is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment,  the effect of the uncertainty on taxable  income, tax bases and unused tax losses and  unused tax credits is recognised. The effect of  the uncertainty is recognised using the method  that, in each case, best reflects the outcome  of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or  the expected value. For each case, the Group  evaluates whether to consider each uncertain  tax treatment separately, or in conjunction  with another or several other uncertain tax  treatments, based on the approach that best  prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.   u   Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing  the  profit  after  tax  (net  off  distribution  on  Perpetual Securities whether declared or not)  attributable to the Owners of the Company by  the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings  per share is computed by dividing the profit /  (loss) after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual  Securities whether declared or not) attributable  to the owners of the Company as adjusted for  the effects of dividend, interest and other  charges relating to the dilutive potential equity  shares by weighted average number of shares  plus dilutive potential equity shares.   v    Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets The amount recognised as a provision is the  best estimate of the consideration required to  settle the present obligation at the end of the  reporting period, taking into account the risks  and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that  arises from past events whose existence will be  confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events beyond  the control of the Group or a present obligation  that is not recognised because it is not probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to  settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of  amount cannot be made. Contingent liabilities may arise from litigation,  taxation and other claims against the Group.  The contingent liabilities are disclosed where it  is management's assessment that the outcome  of any litigation and other claims against  the Group is uncertain or cannot be reliably  quantified, unless the likelihood of an adverse  outcome is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised but  are disclosed in the notes where an inflow of  economic benefits is probable. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent  assets are reviewed at each reporting date. A contingent liability recognised in a  business combination is initially measured  at its fair value. Subsequently, it is  remeasured as per provisions of Ind AS 103.   w     Provision  for  obligations  incidental  to  land  acquisition Provision for obligations incidental to  land acquisition includes expenditure on  rehabilitation & resettlement (R&R) including  the expenditure for providing community  facilities, annuity, old age pension. The Group  estimated the provision based on agreements  with local / government authorities and are  updated based on actuarial valuation.   x   Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses, at each reporting date  whether there is any indication that assets  may be impaired. If any such indication exists,  the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable  amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the  higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 509 ("CGU")'s fair value less costs to disposal and  its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future  cash flows are discounted to their present  values using a pre-tax discount rate that  reflects current market assessment of the  time value of money and the risks specific to  the asset. In determining fair value less cost of  disposal, recent market transactions are taken  into account. If no such transactions can be  identified,  an  appropriate  valuation  model  is  used. These calculations are corroborated by  valuation multiples, quoted share prices for  publicly traded companies or other available  fair value indicators. The Group enters into transaction with suppliers  that involves prepayment in conjunction with  advances for goods and services wherein Group  assesses at each reporting date whether goods  against the advance is recoverable and if there  is any indication, the asset may be provided. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as  at March, 31 and when circumstances indicate  that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by  assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU  (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. The Group bases its impairment calculation  on detailed budget and forecast calculations,  which are prepared separately for each of  the Group's cash-generating unit to which  the individual assets are allocated. For longer  periods, a long term growth rate is calculated  and applied to project future cash flows.  To estimate cash flow projections beyond  periods covered by the most recent budget  / forecasts, the Group estimates cash flow  projections based on estimated growth rate. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or  cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced  to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss  is recognised immediately in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss.   y   Mine Development Expenditure i)     Expenditure incurred towards coal mines  under construction are capitalised to  ‘Coal Mines under construction’ as long as  they meet the capitalisation criteria and  is presented as capital work-in-progress.  Upon commencement of production stage,  the ‘Coal Mines under construction’ is  capitalised and presented as ‘Mining Rights’  under Intangible Assets except in situation  when the Group decide to surrender its  rights in mine and amount is classified as  recoverable from Nominated Authorities. ii)     Mining Rights are amortised using unit-of- production method on the basis of proven  and probable reserves on commencement  of commercial production.     Mine Closure Obligations The liability for meeting the mine closure has  been estimated based on the mine closure  plan in the proportion of total area exploited  to the total area of the mine as a whole.  These costs are updated annually during the  life of the mine to reflect the developments in  mining activities. The mine closure obligations  are included in Mining Rights under Intangible  assets and amortised based on unit of  production method.   z   Asset Acquisition In case of acquisition of an asset or a group  of assets that does not constitute a business,  the Group identifies and recognises individual  identifiable assets acquired (including those  assets  that  meet  the  definition  of,  and  recognition criteria for, intangible assets in  Ind AS 38, Intangible Assets) and liabilities  assumed. The cost incurred is allocated to the  individual identifiable assets and liabilities on  the basis of their relative fair values at the  date of purchase. Such a transaction or event  does not give rise to goodwill / capital reserve.   aa   Amended standards adopted by the Company     The accounting policies adopted in the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements are consistent with those followed  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 510 ADANI POWER LIMITED in the preparation of the Group's annual  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  March 31, 2025, except for amendments to the  existing Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).  The Group has not early adopted any other  standard, interpretation or amendment that  has been issued but is not yet effective.     The Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified new  standards or amendment to existing standards  under Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.     The Group applied following amendments for  the first-time during the current year which  are effective from April 1, 2024 :     Introduction of Ind AS 117     MCA  notified  Ind  AS  117,  a  comprehensive  standard that prescribe, recognition,  measurement and disclosure requirements,  to avoid diversities in practice for accounting  insurance contracts and it applies to all  companies i.e., to all "insurance contracts"  regardless of the issuer. However, Ind AS 117  is not applicable to the entities which are  insurance companies registered with IRDAI.     Additionally, amendments have been made  to Ind AS 101, First-time Adoption of Indian  Accounting Standards, Ind AS 103, Business  Combinations, Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets  Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, Ind  AS 107, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, Ind  AS 109, Financial Instruments and Ind AS 115,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers to  align them with Ind AS 117. The amendments  also introduce enhanced disclosure  requirements, particularly in Ind AS 107, to  provide clarity regarding financial instruments  associated with insurance contracts.     Amendments to Ind AS 116 -Lease liability in a  sale and leaseback     The amendments require an entity to  recognise lease liability including variable  lease payments which are not linked to index  or a rate in a way it does not result into gain on  Right of use asset it retains.     The Group has reviewed the new  pronouncements and based on its evaluation  has determined that these amendments do  not have a significant impact on the Group's  Consolidated Financial Statements. 3     Significant  accounting  judgements,  estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group’s financial statements  requires management to make judgements,  estimates and assumptions that affect the  reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets  and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures,  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.  The estimates and assumptions are based on  historical experience and other factors, including  expectations of future events that are considered  to be relevant. The estimates and underlying  assumptions are continually evaluated and any  revisions thereto are recognised in the period of  revision and future periods if the revision affects    both the current and future periods. Uncertainties  about these assumptions and estimates could result  in outcomes that require a material adjustment to  the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected  in future periods.   Key Sources of estimation uncertainty : The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  year, are described below.  Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments may  change due to market changes or circumstances  arising that are beyond the control of the Group.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur.   i)   Useful lives of property, plant and equipment     In case of the power plant equipment, where  the life of the assets has been estimated at 25  or 40 years based on technical assessment,  taking into account the estimated usage of the  asset and the current operating condition of  the asset, depreciation on the same is provided  based on the useful life of each component  based on technical assessment, if materially  different from that of the main asset. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 511   ii)     Fair value measurement of financial  instruments In estimating the fair value of financial assets  and financial liabilities, the Group uses market  observable data to the extent available.  Where such Level 1 inputs are not available,  the Group establishes appropriate valuation  techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not  feasible, a degree of judgement is required in  establishing fair values. Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in  assumptions about these factors could affect  the reported fair value of financial instruments.  Information about the valuation techniques  and inputs used in determining the fair  value of various assets and liabilities are  disclosed in note 60.   iii)   Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan  and the present value of the gratuity obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include  the determination of the discount rate, future  salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities involved in the valuation and its  long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation  is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed  at each reporting date. Information about  the various estimates and assumptions made  in  determining  the  present  value  of  defined  benefit obligations are disclosed in note 62.   iv)   Impairment of non financial assets For determining whether property, plant and  equipment, intangible assets and goodwill  are impaired, it requires an estimation of the  value in use of the relevant cash generating  units. The value in use calculation is based  on a Discounted Cash Flow model over the  estimated useful life of the Power Plants.  Further, the cash flow projections are based on  estimates and assumptions relating to tariff,  change in law claims, operational performance  of the Plants, life extension plans, market prices  of coal and other fuels, exchange variations,  inflation, terminal value etc. which are  considered reasonable by the Management.  (refer note 55).   v)   Taxes Significant management judgement is required  to determine the amount of deferred tax  assets that can be recognised, based upon the  likely timing and the level of future taxable  profits  together  with  future  tax  planning  strategies, including estimates of temporary  differences reversing on account of available  benefits  under  the  Income  Tax  Act,  1961.  (Also refer note 28).   Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused  tax losses to the extent that it is probable that  taxable profit will be available against which the  losses can be utilised. Significant management  judgement is required to determine the amount  of deferred tax assets that can be recognised,  based upon the likely timing and the level of  future taxable profits together with future tax  planning strategies.   vi)   Income / Revenue Revenue from Operations on account of Force  Majeure / Change in Law events or Interest  Income on account of carrying cost in terms of  Power Purchase Agreements / Supplemental  Power Purchase Agreements with various  State Power Distribution Utilities is accounted  for / recognised by the Group based on best  management estimates following principles  of prudence, as per the orders / reports of  Regulatory Authorities, the Hon’ble Supreme  Court of India (“Hon’ble Supreme Court”) and the  outstanding receivables thereof in the books of  account have been adjusted / may be subject  to adjustments on account of consequential  orders of the respective Regulatory Authorities,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court and final closure  of the matters with the respective Discoms.  (refer note 37 and 38). In certain cases, the Group has claimed  compensation from the Discoms based on  management’s interpretation of the regulatory  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 512 ADANI POWER LIMITED orders and various technical parameters  including provisional methodology for coal cost  recovery, which are subject to final verification  and confirmation by the respective Discoms,  and hence, in these cases, the revenues have  been  recognised  during  various  financial  years / periods, on a prudent basis with  conservative attributable parameters in the  books. The necessary true-up adjustments  for revenue claims (including carrying cost /  delayed payment surcharge) are made in the  books on final acknowledgement / regulatory  orders / settlement of matters with respective  Discoms or eventual recovery of the claims,  whichever is earlier. In case of Udupi TPP, Revenue from sale of power  and other income is recognised upon judgement  by the management for recoverability of the  claims based on the relevant contractual terms  / provisional tariff rates as provided by the  regulator / governing tariff regulations, to the  extent applicable, having regard to mechanism  provided in applicable tariff regulations and  the bilateral arrangement with the customers,  which may be subject to adjustments in  future years, on receipt of final orders of the  respective  Regulatory  Authorities  or  final  closure of the matter with the customers.  (refer note 37 and 38).   vii)   Classification of Trade Receivables In cases of circumstances / matters where there  are pending litigations on regulatory matters  /  change  in  law  claims,  the  classification  of  disputed / undisputed trade receivables is  a matter of judgement based on facts and  circumstances. The Group has evaluated the  fact pattern and circumstances, including  ongoing discussions with the Discoms, for  each such regulatory matter pending to be  adjudicated by the relevant authority. In cases, where rule of law and principles  of economic restitution have already been  established by APTEL / Supreme Court in  similar matters, the revenues are recognised  on prudent and conservative technical  parameters,  significant  amounts  have  been  recovered already and the management does  not perceive any downside risks in future  on  final  adjudication  by  Supreme  Court  and  settlement of matter with Discoms, the related  receivables are classified as undisputed. In cases, where discussions with Discoms have  not made reasonable progress and matters are  sub-judice, the related receivables are classified  as disputed, even though the management is  reasonably  confident  of  recovering  the  dues  in full, backed by the regulatory orders in  favour of the Group.   viii)   Mega Power Status One of the thermal power plant has availed  exemption of customs / excise duty in  pursuance to terms of the provisional mega  power policy as notified by the Government of  India. The Company has not recongnised for  the reduction in cost to property, plant and  equipment as a grant, pending compliance of  terms of Mega Power Status which needs to be  attained within 156 months i.e. September, 2022,  from the date of import of plant and equipment  as per approval by the Ministry of Power  ("MoP"), Government of India vide amendment  dated April 07, 2022. Ministry of Power vide  its letter dt. December 19, 2024, has granted  proportional  Final  Mega  Power  Certificate  to the extent of 71% of the installed capacity  which is tied up under long term Power  Purchase Agreements. For the balance untied  installed capacity of 29%, the Management is  confident to receive the extension to comply  with the conditions for balance capacity.     ix)     Applicability  of  Appendix  D  -  Service  Concession  Arrangements  of  Ind  AS  115  Revenue from contracts with customers       The Company has entered into PPAs with  various state DISCOMs for supplying power  for a period upto 25 years from its thermal  power plants (TPP). These TPPs have been  set up on Build-Own-Operate basis with no  transfer of assets at the end of the term of  PPA. The management is of the view that PPA  does not cover the entire life of these power  plants. Further, the DISCOMs does not control  any significant residual interest and does not  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 513 restrict the Company's practical ability to  sell or pledge these assets. Accordingly, the  management is of the view that Appendix D to  Ind AS 115 is not applicable to the Company.   x)     Consolidation  of  entity  in  which  the  Group  holds less than a majority of voting rights       The Company holds 49% equity stake in Moxie  Power Generation Limited.("MPGL") In view  of effective operational control exercised by  the Company, MPGL is treated as a subsidiary  for consolidation.   xi)     Consolidation of entity which is under litigation       The Group has acquired Coastal Energen Private  Limited (“CEPL”) through National Company  Law Tribunal (“NCLT”). Further, the approved  resolution plan, also included the amalgamation  of CEPL with Moxie Power Generation Limited  (“MPGL”), a Special Purpose Vehicle (“SPV”)  incorporated by the Consortium.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 549 (ii)   In case of PPAs governed by section 62 of Electricity Act, 2003, the Group recognises revenue from sale  of power based on the most recent tariff order / provisional tariff approved by the respective Regulatory  Commission, as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (“APTEL”) / Regulatory commissions,  and necessary provisions / adjustment considered on conservative basis. This revenue is recognised having  regard to mechanism provided in applicable tariff regulations and the bilateral arrangements with the  Discoms. Such tariff orders are subject to conclusion of final tariff orders in terms of Multiyear Tariff (“MYT”)  Regulations at the end of respective tariff period. (iii)   In respect of Kawai TPP   In the matter relating to shortfall in availability of domestic linkage coal, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its  order dated August 31, 2020 has admitted all tariff compensation claims for additional coal costs incurred  for power generation and the Company continues to realise the claim amount towards compensation.   During the previous year, Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Limited (“RUVITL”) (formerly known as  Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Limited) has filed a fresh petition before Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory  Commission (“RERC”) primarily challenging the methodology and operating parameters considered while  arriving at the tariff compensation claim for additional coal cost incurred for power generation by the  Company which had earlier been settled by RUVITL in March, 2022 based on Hon’ble Supreme Court order  dated August 31, 2020.

(iv)   In respect to Mundra TPP    (a)     The Company and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (“GUVNL”) had entered into an additional  Supplemental Power Purchase Agreements (“SPPAs”) dated March 30, 2022 to resolve all pending  matter / dispute relating to Bid 1 and Bid 2 Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA / SPPA”), towards supply of  2434 MW of power and thereby approached CERC to determine the base energy tariff rates for power  sales under Bid 1 & Bid 2 SPPAs, with retrospective effect from October 15, 2018, for further submission  to the Government of Gujarat (“GoG”). CERC vide its order dated June 13, 2022 recommended the base  energy tariff rates for final approval of GoG which is still pending as on reporting date. CERC order allows  the Company and GUVNL to mutually agree on adoption of six monthly or monthly CERC escalation  index to apply over base energy tariff rate as on October, 2018 as per the provisions of earlier SPPA  dated December 5, 2018 having impact on determination of subsequent period energy rates.   (b)     Pending approval of the base energy tariff rate by GoG and also the mutual agreement between  the Company and GUVNL as regards adoption of monthly / six-monthly CERC escalation index, the  Company has been supplying power to GUVNL based on certain mechanism whereby actual fuel cost  incurred gets pass through in the billing of energy charges, from March 1, 2022, onwards till date  as per understanding with GUVNL for the purpose of additional Supplemental PPA dated March 30,  2022. The Company also realised significant amounts of invoices billed to GUVNL, although there are  certain deductions made by GUVNL which are pending reconciliation / settlement. During the previous  year, the Company received communication from GUVNL seeking refund of  `  1,172.69 crore towards  energy charges on account of adjustment of coal cost in respect of power supplied during October 15,  2018 to March 31, 2023, which was adjusted in the books as a matter of caution, though disputed by  company with GUVNL.       The Company continues to recognise energy charges revenue as per amount billed based on actual  fuel costs since the date of SPPA, pending approval of base energy tariff and agreement between the  Company and GUVNL regarding adoption of method of CERC escalation index, which has impact on the  Company’s energy charges claims, depending on the trend of coal price movement.

(c)     In respect of the matter relating to shortfall in availability of domestic coal under Fuel Supply Agreement  (“FSAs”) with Coal India Limited's subsidiaries for supply of power against 1424 MW of PPA from  Mundra TPP (reduced to 1200 MW PPA pursuant to the SPPAs dated February 28, 2023) with Haryana  Discoms, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated April 20, 2023 upheld the APTEL’s orders dated  November 3, 2020 and June 30, 2021, allowing the tariff compensation claims (including carrying cost  thereon) relating to NCDP and SHAKTI policy, respectively.

(d)     The Company has claimed compensation for alternate coal cost incurred for supply of power under  1,200 MW of Supplemental Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) with Haryana Discoms. The Haryana  Discoms have sought certain information to validate such claims.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 563 51   The Company had sought cancellation of the Jitpur coal block and requested the Nominated Authority, Ministry  of Coal, New Delhi, to cancel the Vesting Order, vide its representation dated October 31, 2020 and had also  requested to authority for refund of the costs of  `  138.66 crore incurred by it and for release of the performance  bank guarantee of  `  92.90 crore given to the Nominated Authority. The Nominated Authority vide its letter dated  September 17, 2021, had accepted the surrender petition by the Company. The Nominated Authority concluded  the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on September 13, 2022. Pursuant to this, the Coal Mines Development  and Production Agreement (“CMDPA”) has been signed between the new bidder and the Nominated Authority,  Ministry of Coal on October 13, 2022.   The Nominated Authority, has issued the Final Compensation Order dated November 13, 2024 and the Company  is in process of submitting the required documents with the Nominated Authority, for final settlement and  closure of the matter.   52   The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited (“REL”) had incurred cost of  `  55.57 crore  and  `  30.75 crore towards development of Talabira Coal mine and Ganeshpura Coal mine, respectively in  the earlier years.   In the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon’ble Delhi High Court requesting  surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India’s (“UoI”) notification dated April 16, 2015 stating capping  of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the release of bid  security. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated April 15, 2019 dismissed the petitions on the  ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions before Hon’ble Supreme  Court to set aside the order of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication of the petitions, Hon’ble  Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated May 30, 2019 that no coercive action to be taken  in these matters.   The management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the  entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.   However, the matter has been pending for long period of time, the company based on prudence principles has  fully provided the amount in the books for the purpose of financial reporting. 53   The Government of India conducted bidding for allocation of coal blocks, under the coal block auction  process whereby MEL acquired the rights of Tokisud Coal Block (in the state of Jharkhand) on March 18, 2015.  Subsequently, in the month of April 2015, by way of a notification, Ministry of Power put cap on the fixed /  capacity charges due to which MEL had filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi for impugning the above  referred notification and also offered to return the said coal block to the Government of India against return of  the performance security in the form of Bank Guarantee of  `  261.76 crore provided by MEL and moneys paid,  without any penalty.   However, Hon'ble High Court vide its judgement dated April 15, 2019 dismissed the petition of MEL. Subsequently,  MEL has filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon'ble Supreme Court against the order of the Hon'ble  High Court. Meanwhile, the bank guarantee of  `  261.76 crore had been invoked by the Nominated Authority.   The Union Ministry of Coal has re-allocated the said coal block to National Mineral Development Corporation  (NMDC) for commercial mining. MEL had incurred a total cost of  `  491.62 crore towards development of tokisud  coal mine. Nominated authority vide order dated March 16, 2022 determined  `  163.23 crore being the total  compensation payable by successful allottee (NMDC) to MEL. The said amount has been received during the year  ended March 31, 2023. MEL has fully provided for the balance receivable of  `  328.41 crore. 54   i)     The National Green Tribunal ("NGT") in a matter relating to non-compliance of environmental norms relating  to Udupi thermal power plant (“Udupi TPP”) directed the Company vide its order dated March 14, 2019,  to make payment of  `  5.00 crore as an interim environmental compensation to Central Pollution Control  Board ("CPCB"). 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 564 ADANI POWER LIMITED       NGT vide its order dated May 31, 2022 directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of  `  47.02  crore. The Company has recognised expense provision in the books on a conservative basis, although, the  Company has filed an appeal with the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated August 26, 2022 against the above  referred NGT order. The Udupi TPP continues to operate in compliance with all the conditions under  Environment Clearance as at March 31, 2025.   ii)     In case of MEL, 'Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT) vide order dated August 28, 2018 has prohibited  Northern Coalfields Limited (NCL) to transport coal by road, who was the major supplier of coal to the MEL.  The customers of NCL (along with MEL) had requested for some time to allow till a alternative arrangement  for transportation of coal is in place. The Oversight Committee of NGT (Committee) as an interim measure  allowed to transportation of coal by road for two months period.       In the meantime, NCL moved application before Hon’ble NGT to review its order. However their application  was rejected. Thereafter NCL moved to Hon’ble Supreme Court who stated that ‘status quo as of today shall  be maintained in the meantime’.       However the Committee is of the view that Status quo order was passed when NGT order on coal  transportation was in operation which has prohibited NCL to transport coal by road. Consequently, a General  Notice from NCL on June 22, 2019 has been served on MEL confirming the above position to stop sale of  coal by road to its customers in Singrauli M.P, Sonabhadra U.P.       Subsequently, NCL decided to keep the sale of coal in abeyance for the time being and to approach Hon’ble  Supreme Court for further resolution of issue. MEL has also approached Hon’ble Supreme Court to obtain  necessary directions which would ensure continuous operations of the MEL, since its operations came to  halt fully (for 7 days) after supply of coal being stopped by NCL.       Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated July 01, 2019 has ordered to maintain status quo i.e. permitting the  transportation of coal by road from NCL till the further order. Pending the decision of Hon'ble Supreme  Court, MEL is presently getting the supply of coal through road for its operations of generation of electricity. 55   (a)     In respect of Mundra TPP, the management believes that on account of resolution of majority of the issues  relating to tariff compensation claim with GUVNL and Haryana Discoms and also on account of execution of  360 MW PPA with MPSEZ Utilities Limited (“MUL”), and certain other factors, Mundra TPP of the Company  would continue to establish profitable operations over a foreseeable future and meet its performance and  financial obligations. During the previous year, the Company has resumed supply of power to Haryana  Discom and consequently has improved its operational performance in terms of achieving Higher Plant load  factor (PLF) and generating positive operating cashflows, hence, based on the assessment of value in use  of Mundra TPP, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its Mundra TPP  related property, plant and equipment aggregating to  `  14,260.35 crore as at March 31, 2025.   (b)     On March 31, 2025, the Company has determined the recoverable amounts of all its thermal power plants  over their useful lives based on the Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) identified, as required under Indian  Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) 36 “Impairment of Assets”, based on the estimates relating to tariff, demand  for power, operational performance of the plants, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels,  exchange variations, inflation, terminal value, climate change impact, etc. which are considered reasonable  by the Management. On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Company has  concluded that the recoverable value of all the thermal power plants is higher than their carrying amounts  including goodwill assigned to each CGU.       On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Group has concluded that the  recoverable value of such CGUs individually is higher than their respective carrying amounts as at March 31,  2025. However, if these estimates and assumptions were to change in future, there could be corresponding  impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants.

The Management  ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Group through appropriate policies and procedures and  the risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives.  All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have appropriate  skills, experience and supervision. It is the group policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes  may be undertaken.     The Group's financial liabilities (other than derivatives) comprises mainly of borrowings including interest accrual,  leases, trade, capital and other payables. The Group's financial assets (other than derivatives) comprises mainly  of investments, cash and cash equivalents, other balances with banks, loans, trade and other receivables.   In the ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 566 ADANI POWER LIMITED   (i)   Market risk         Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because  of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises four types of risk : interest rate risk, currency risk,  commodity risk and equity price risk.     a)   Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate  because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market  interest rates relates primarily to the part of Group’s debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a mixed portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans  and borrowings. Significant portion of Group's borrowings is in  `  and are borrowed at fluctuating  interest rates. The sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments  not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has  been carried out on the amount of floating rate liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period.  The year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the  year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably  possible change in interest rates. In case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points on the exposure of borrowings (having  fluctuating rates i.e. exposed to changes in rates) of  `  28,784.49 crore as on March 31, 2025 and  `  28,053.90 crore as on March 31, 2024 respectively and if all other variables were held constant, the  Group's profit or loss for the year would increase or decrease as follows : ( `  In crore) Particulars For the year ended   March 31, 2025  For the year ended   March 31, 2024 Impact on Profit or Loss before tax for the year  143.92   140.27  Impact on Equity  107.70   104.97    The Group intends to hold investment in liquid mutual fund for relatively shorter period and hence,  interest rate risk is not material to that extent.     b)   Foreign currency risk     Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate  because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign  exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities (Coal imports, trade receivables, etc.)  and borrowings. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected  to realise in future. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by entering into currency swap for  converting rupee loan into other foreign currency for taking advantage of lower cost of borrowing in  stable currency environment. The Group also enters into various foreign exchange hedging contracts  such as forward covers, swaps, options etc. to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate  movement on foreign currency borrowings or trade payables. (including Capital Creditors)   Every one percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee  and U.S. dollar on the unhedged exposure of $ 53.58 million as on March 31, 2025 and $ 73.52 million  as on March 31, 2024 would have affected the Group's profit or loss for the year as follows : 57   Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies :  (Contd...) 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 567 57   Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies :  (Contd...) ( `  In crore) Particulars For the year ended   March 31, 2025  For the year ended   March 31, 2024 Impact on Profit or Loss before tax for the year (Net  of amounts capitalised under Property, Plant and  Equipment)  4.58   6.13  Impact on Equity  3.43   4.59      c)   Commodity price risk   The Group’s exposure to commodity price is affected by a number of factors including the effect of  regulation, the price volatility of coal prices in the market, including imported coal, contract size and  length, market condition etc. which is moderated by optimising the procurement under fuel supply  agreement and getting compensated under long term power purchase agreements and change in law  regulation. In case, the Group anticipates non-availability of coal, the same is mitigated by sourcing  imported coal in advance to meet the demand. Its operating / trading activities require the on-going  purchase for continuous supply of coal and other commodities. Therefore, the Group monitors its  purchases closely to optimise the procurement cost.     d)   Equity price risk                       The Group does not have equity price risk.   (ii)   Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer  contract, leading to a financial loss.     a)   Trade Receivables         The Group is having majority of receivables from State Electricity Boards which are Government  undertakings and have interest clause on delayed payments and hence, they are secured from credit  losses in the future. Receivables are secured by letter of credit amounting to  `  4,040.70 crore (Previous  year  `  3,733.74 crore). Further, the Group holds sovereign guarantee from BPDB for the entire receivables  under Power Purchase Agreement.     b)   Other Financial Assets         This comprises of deposit with banks, loans, investments in mutual funds, derivative assets and other  receivables. The Group limits its exposure to credit risks arising from these financial assets and there  is no collateral held against these because counter parties are group companies, banks and recognised  financial institutions. Banks and recognised financial institutions have high credit ratings assigned by  credit rating agencies.   (iii)   Liquidity risk       Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with  its financial liabilities.       The Group monitors its liquidity requirement using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider  the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.  The Group’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 568 ADANI POWER LIMITED and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure. A balance between continuity of funding and  flexibility is maintained through internal accruals as well as adequately adjusting the working capital cycle.       Having regard to the nature of the business wherein the Group is able to generate regular cash flows  over a period of time, any surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital  management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and cash equivalents (to the extent  required) and any excess is invested in highly liquid mutual funds with appropriate maturities to optimise  the cash returns on investments while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities.       Read with note 59, the Group expects to generate positive cash flows from operations in order to meet its  external financial liabilities as they fall due and also consistently monitors funding options available in the  debt and capital market with a view to maintain financial flexibility.       Maturity profile of financial liabilities :       The table below has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial  liabilities including interest that will be paid on those liabilities upto the maturity of the instruments.

621 Notice Justification  as  to  why  the  RPT  is  in  the  interest of the Company.  Note 1: Sale and Purchase of Power Note 1 (i): Sale of Power In order to sell power in merchant on Indian Energy  Exchange (IEX) and under bilateral agreement, APL, MEL  and MPGL propose to sell power to PTSL, being the holder of  power trading license as per Central Electricity Regulatory  Commission (CERC) regulation. The sale of power to PTSL  shall be done at market discovered prices. PTSL will charge  nominal trading margin for traded quantum which is within  the range provided under CERC regulation. Note 1 (ii): Purchase of Power On some occasions during the year, APL; MEL; and MPGL  may procure power from alternative sources to fulfil their  obligation under PPAs. For such purchase of power, APL;  MEL; and MPGL propose to engage with PTSL, which  holds a power trading license, as per CERC regulation.  The purchase of power will be done at market discovered  prices available on IEX. PTSL will charge nominal  trading margin which is within the range provided under  CERC regulation. Note 2: Lending of funds and providing financial  assistance MEL,  subsidiary  of  APL  is  developing  a  brownfield  power project with an additional capacity of 1600 MW  (800X2) under Phase II and Phase III each at Singrauli,  Madhya Pradesh. Power plants are capital intensive  in nature and thus require heavy initial and ongoing  investment. MEL will need funds in order to meet the  requirements for expansion.  APL proposes to lend funds to MEL in the form of  unsecured loan. The loan shall be provided with  an interest rate based on nominal margin on APL’s  projected weighted average long-term rupee borrowing  cost during FY 2025-26. Note 3: Investment in Shares and Securities APL also proposes to infuse funds in MEL by way of  investment in Equity instruments/Other securities  like debentures, preference shares and UPS etc., on  a long-term basis and on the terms and conditions as  per market benchmark to meet MEL’s requirement for  capacity expansion. Note 4: Banking Facility utilisation The lenders of APL have approved utilization of banking  facilities in the nature of non-fund limits sanctioned  to  APL  for  the  benefit  of  its  subsidiaries  including  MEL. Based on this sanction, MEL intends to utilise  APL's limits for opening Letter of Credit (LCs) / Bank  Guarantees (BGs) for the expansion projects at MEL.  The said limit is secured by the assets of APL. MEL is  primarily responsible for making payments on due dates.  However, responsibility in case of default lies with APL  (as a parent entity). For the purpose of utilisation of banking facilities in the  nature of non-fund limits of APL by MEL, any charges  including LC charges and other fees incurred by APL, if  any will be recovered from MEL on cost-to-cost basis. Note 5: Purchase and Sale of Goods Note 5 (i): Purchase of Goods In case of shortfall of availability of required quantum  of coal, APL may procure coal from MEL under high seas  sales arrangement. The price of the transaction will be  as per the Index of the respective country from which  coal is procured, duly adjusted for market factors and  actual parameters like Moisture, Sulphur, Ash, Gross  Calorific Value (GCV) etc. plus nominal margin. Such an  arrangement is in the commercial/beneficial interest of  the Company as it will ensure uninterrupted operations  and power generation.  Note 5 (ii): Sale of Goods In case of shortfall of availability of required quantum of  coal at MEL, APL may sell coal to MEL. The sale of Coal  to its subsidiary will be under high seas arrangement at  a price as per Index of respective country where coal is  procured, duly adjusted for market factors and actual  parameters like Moisture, Sulphur, Ash, Gross Calorific  Value (GCV) etc. plus nominal margin. This arrangement  would be in the commercial/beneficial interest of APL  as it will ensure uninterrupted operations and power  generation of MEL. Note 6: Sale of Power APL is having Dahanu Thermal Power Station (‘DTPS’),  comprising two units of 250MW each which supplies  power under a long-term Power Purchase Arrangement  (PPA) governed under Section 62 of the Electricity  Act, 2003 to Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited  (Distribution Licensee in the areas in and around the  suburbs of Mumbai). The existing PPA is valid up to March 31, 2030 wherein  tariff and other charges such as fixed charge, energy  charge and incentives are approved by Maharashtra  Electricity Regulatory Commission (‘MERC’) in  accordance with Tariff Regulations and various other  orders of the said Commission.
