RVNL promotes use of modern technologies on Indian Railways namely Electronic Interlocking (EI), Digital Axle Counters, Fiber Optic Cable Network, Automatic Block Signaling, ETCS L1/L2/L3, IOT based Diagnostic & Predictive Maintenance systems etc. 

73 The technological advancement is aimed to achieve high level of safety in train operations, availability of system and increased speeds of trains with minimum head ways. This ensures the efficient punctual operation of Freight as well as of Coaching Trains. This has resulted in reduction of turnaround in freight transportation. With continuous and tireless effort of S&T vertical of RVNL in Railway Infrastructure, Indian Railways is able to achieve increase in freight loading and operation of large number of passenger trains across the length and breadth of the country. RVNL is a major contributor in providing EI installations on Indian Railways in connection with Doubling, 3 rd  Line, New Line and Gauge Conversion. Keeping its tradition high, during FY 2024-25, RVNL has commissioned Electronic Interlockings at 47 Stations on Indian Railways. Besides new EIs, RVNL has commissioned modification at 44 stations on Indian Railways to decongest Railways existing routes. In its commitment to Indian Railways, RVNL has commissioned Major Yards of Indian Railways such as Yard remodeling of Ambodala, Talcher Road,  and Adityapura with routes varying from 200 to 585 Routes. RVNL has taken up 86 Nos. of Non-Interlocking (NIs) of stations for commissioning of Doubling & 3 rd  Line projects during the year. RVNL has also commissioned the 30 numbers of  IBS, 166 Automatic Signalling using Electronic Interlocking and 41 Nos of mid-section level crossing gates have been interlocked with signals to improve safety of road user. Not only on the Signalling front, RVNL has also completed the incredible achievement in the area of telecommunication by providing 2763 km of Fiber Optic Network and 6 Quad Cable network during the year. RVNL has increased  team of IRSTELO license holders who are experienced to approve Logic & Interface Circuits and design drawings of all types of Railway signaling systems in-house. Besides, Railway Board had entrusted RVNL to approve Logic & Interface Circuits through 3 rd  Party IRSTELO license holders for CR, SCR, WR & WCR up to 75 routes. So far, RVNL has checked Logic & Interface Circuits of more than 20 stations of NCR icw 3rd line Automatic Block Signalling. This has reduced the workload of Zonal Railways on document approval organization and expedited the approval process of Logic & Interface Circuits. This has resulted in timely commissioning of large number of stations by RVNL to adhere the target set by Railway Board. RVNL has commissioned latest Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) Signalling System from JOKA to MAJERHAT (10 km UP & DN each) on Kolkata Metro . Similarily Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) based Signalling System from Kavi Subhash to Beliaghat (10 km UP & DN each) on Kolkata Metro is ready for commissioning. RVNL has participated in various tenders of Automatic Signalling of Zonal Railways and has been awarded Automatic Signalling works of Rs 148.96 crore (SECR & SR) during FY 2024-25. RVNL has also participated in BSNL tender for Development (Creation, Upgradation, Operation & Maintenance) of Middle Mile Network of Bharat Net on Design Build Operate & Maintain (DBOM) for UP East and UP West and has been awarded works worth Rs 13235.56 crore during FY 2024-25. Having played a very vital role in providing large nos. of signaling installations in connection with large infrastructure projects on Indian Railway, Signaling & Telecommunication vertical is on the lookout for opportunities in various signalling and telecom sector of Railways & other industries within India & abroad. 3.7 Projects under implementation: There are 120 projects under various stages of implementation by RVNL. 3.7.1 The details of 28 projects assigned by Ministry of Railways to RVNL till March 2025 and which are under implementation are as under:

This is a strategic project of Government of India. The agreement was signed in January 2023. The work has taken off well. As on date, the physical progress is 45%, 75% of marine and 10% of land side works have been completed. 3.9 Strategic Railway Projects by RVNL 3.9.1 New Pamban Bridge (2.08 km): Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), was entrusted with the responsibility of construction of New Pamban Bridge in 2019. As the nodal agency for this ambitious infrastructure project, RVNL’s role extended from concept to commissioning and not a mere construction of new bridge. RVNL commitment was to deliver a structure that would not only meet the needs of the present but also preserve region’s connectivity and economic vitality for time to come. Thus, the project was not merely a replacement to an old bridge, it was about setting a new benchmark in modern bridge engineering. The New Pamban Bridge is designed as a vertical lift structure with cables/pulley arrangement with advanced geotechnical studies, hydrodynamic analysis, and the use of durable corrosion-resistant materials, we ensured the longevity and strength of the structure. We also used modern construction techniques to speed up the process while ensuring the highest levels of quality control. Challenges in Construction: Overcoming the Odds The construction of the New Pamban Bridge presented numerous challenges, ranging from environmental obstacles to logistical complexities. The Palk Strait’s turbulent waters, strong winds, and unpredictable weather patterns created difficulties in the construction process. Additionally, the region’s susceptibility to cyclones and seismic activity necessitated careful planning and robust design. Logistically, transporting heavy materials to the remote construction site posed another challenge. The narrow windows of opportunity provided by the tides had to be maximized to facilitate the timely delivery of materials. Despite these hurdles, the team of engineers and workers displayed exceptional ingenuity innovative solutions, cutting-edge technology, and sheer determination overcoming the challenges and thereby ensuring the successful completion of the bridge. It is a matter of great pride that doing the course of work involving more than 1400 tons of fabrication, launching of lift spans and 99 Girders, the whole work was absolutely injury free. This is testimony to RVNL’s working methods taking utmost care for safety and health. The Iconic Pamban Bridge was inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India. Salient features of Pamban Bridge: Total Length of Bridge : 2.08 km Span Configuration : 99x18.30m + 1x72.50m Weight of Lift span :   652 T Weight of Towers : 760 T Weight of each Counterweig ht : 310 T Height of Tower :  34.80 m Lift Height : 17 m Lifting Time :  5 min 30 Sec Innovations and New Technology: • Stainless steel reinforcement used in foundation/ Sub-structure. • 19.65 m long steel plates to eliminate splice joint  in the approach span girders of 18.3 m span. • Fully welded girder (Box sections)  is adopted for lift span truss to minimize the corrosion. • 20 m long rails 60 kg to reduce  rail joints. • Robust  Painting Scheme  adopted – design life – 38 years. • Piling by gantry  method on Mandapam end due to shallow depth. • Complete automation of lifting/ monitoring (SCADA). 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 92 3.9.2 Rishikesh-karanprayag New Rail Link Project – 125 km This transformative project in Uttarakhand is being executed by RVNL. It will connect the state’s remote hinterlands directly by rail, marking a new chapter in regional connectivity and development. The project spans 125 kms, and the route is charted through the challenging Himalayan terrain. The project comprises 12 new stations 28 tunnels with a cumulative tunnel length of 213 kms and 19 major rail bridges, making it one of the most challenging projects currently underway in India. This line may also serve as the main feeder route for any future Chardham connectivity. The first block section, a 5.7 km stretch between Virbhadra and Yog Nagri Rishikesh, was successfully completed and commissioned in March 2020. Of the total 213 kms of tunnel excavation planned, 193 km have already been completed, along with 82 km of final lining. 8 out of the 19 major rail bridges have been completed, ensuring vital connectivity across difficult river crossings and valleys. In addition, four key road bridges have been const ructed to facilitate access to work sites and future stations. Of the 46 tunnel drives planned, 35 breakthroughs have been successfully achieved. The New Line is expected to be a catalyst for the socio economic development of the region and will considerably reduce travel time. The breakthrough of 14.57-km-long tunnel no 8 between Devprayag and Janasu was witnessed by Hon’ble Railway Minister. This is the India’s longest transportation tunnel. 

93 3.9.3 Bhanupali-Bilaspur-Beri New Line The 63 km long Railway line passes through the challenging hill terrain of the lower Himalayas with a total route tunneling of 25.9 km. The proposed electrified BG rail line shall enable regional development through the connectivity of Himachal Pradesh with the national railway network and will act as a gateway to connect with the international borders towards Leh for strategic purposes. 3.9.4 Kolkata Metro Projects: 3.9.4.1 Indian Railways transferred the works of four major projects for extension of Kolkata Metro to RVNL in March 2010 viz. • Joka-BBD Bag via Majerhat (16.72 km) • Dum Dum Airport-New Garia via Rajarhat (32 km) • Baranagar-Barrackpore& Dakshineswar (14.5 km) • Noapara (Ex.)-Baranagar (2.6 km) 3.9.4.2 Thereon RVNL was entrusted to build Metro corridors of about 65 km in Kolkata without any survey of underground utilities and without any DPR (Detailed Project Report). The issues like removal of encroachments and relocation of utilities along with delay in availability of traffic diversion have affected the execution. RVNL has taken all possible action for implementation and early commissioning of Metro projects for larger interest of people of Kolkata. 3.9.4.3 The foundation stone for Joka-BBD Bag project was laid by Her Excellency, President of India on 22.01.2010. Subsequently, 2 packages for viaduct and 2 packages for stations were awarded in December 2010 and April 2012 respectively. This entire Metro corridor has been planned in 3 phases i.e. in 1 st  phase from Joka to Majerhat elevated section and in the 2 nd  phase from Majerhat to Mominpur, in 3 rd  phase from Mominrur to Esplanade station as underground section. Originally sanctioned as elevated section but Material Modification is sanctioned by Ministry of Railways for underground system from Mominpore to Esplanade.  For construction of Mominpur station, working permission from Army HQ has been received only on 20.03.2023 and work going on full swing. 3.9.4.4 Joka – Esplanade Metro Corridor In the Metro corridor from Joka to Majerhat, from Joka to Taratala (Phase-I) 6.50 km has been inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 30.12.2022 & commercial services started by Metro Railway on 02.01.2023. Another phase of 1.25 km from Taratala to Majerhat has been inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 06.03.2024 & commercial services started by Metro Railway has been commenced from 15.03.2024. The station over yard at Majerhat is on three layers. Beyond Majerhat, the Joka to Majerhat Metro Corridor is being extended upto Esplanade going underground from Mominpore ramp. The Works contract for the underground section has been awarded and the works of underground portion has been started. Working permission has accorded after Hon’ble High Court/ Kolkata’s clearance for execution 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 94 in Defence land in the Maidan area for the public interest of Kolkata. The NOC from Victoria Memorial Trust has been received recently to go ahead with underground station near Victoria Memorial. Since this Metro stretch is a standalone system, a Maintenance Depot has been developed in Joka and Ph-I part is under operation. Earlier, due to non-availability of land (24.48 hectare), the tender for the depot was discharged twice, once in February 2013 and again on October 2017. Thus, the commissioning is planned in 3 phases i.e (a)Ph-I-Joka-Taratala, (b)Ph-II- Taratala-Majerhat, (c) Ph-III- Majerhat- Esplanade. After starting of commercial services of 1 st  & 2 nd  phase commissioning the outskirt population of Kolkata has been connected to Kolkata which is a great relief for the people residing away from Kolkata but normally come to Kolkata on daily basis doing a tough journey every day. Presently land for construction of cut and cover between Mominpur station and Khidirpore station and land for Khidirpore station is not made available by Kolkata Armed Police and Nepal Consulate at Kolkata. 3.9.4.5 New Garia-Airport Metro Corridor In the section of New Garia to Rabindra Tirtha of Dum Dum Airport-New Garia project, initially 4 packages of Viaduct were awarded on 21.10.2011. About 20 km viaduct has been completed.  The contracts for 21 stations (3 packages) were awarded on 05.03.2014. Out of 21 stations, station land for Technopolis Metro station is now handed over. The project got delayed because of issues relating to land acquisition, traffic diversion, utility diversion and other permission over busy EM Bypass road. Further, change of alignment proposed by State Government where unauthorized buildings were constructed even after the Gazette Notification for Metro construction, and other impediments like shifting of markets, traffic guard, raising of 220 kV overhead line, removal of encroachments, etc. slowed down the progress of work. Substantial part of these impediments have been either removed and the balance are on the way of being removed.  The alignment from City Centre- II to Airport is now approved by State Government after long persuasion and contract for construction of Metro beyond Titumir to Airport has been awarded on 18.01.2021, the work is under progress. In this section the commissioning was planned in 3 phases phases earlier i.e (a)Ph-I-New Garia-Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, (b)Ph-II- Hemanta Mukhopadhyay to Salt Lake Sector-V and (c) Ph-III- Salt Lake Sector-V to Airport. Due to unavailable work front in various stretches of the corridor and considering commissioning point of view the phases were revised i.e. (a)Ph-I-New Garia-Hemanta  Mukhopadhyay, (b)Ph-II- Hemanta Mukhopadhyay to Beleghata, (c) Ph-III Beleghata to Salt Lake Sector-V and (d) Ph-IV- Salt Lake Sector-V to City Centre 2 and (e)Ph-V City Centre 2 to Airport. Now in present scenario , (a)  Ph-I-New Garia- Hemanta Mukhopadhyay (5.4 km)commercial run has been started from 15.03.2024 after being dedicated to the nation by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 06.03.2024 , (b) Ph-II-Hemanta Mukhopadhyay to Beleghata (4.46 km)  CCRS Inspection has been conducted on 28.03.2024 & 29.03.2024,(c) Ph-III Beleghata to Salt Lake 

95 Sector-V was planned for commission in Dec’2024, however due to non-availability of traffic diversion block between Belaghata to Gour Kishore Ghosh stations, work of launching of viaduct is held up since Feb 2025. It will take 5-6 months to complete the remaining work once the traffic diversion is allowed by Kolkata Police and Bidhan Nagar Police. Balance 02 phase i.e. (d) Ph-IV- Salt Lake Sector-V to City Centre 2 has been planned for commission in Dec’2025 and (e)Ph-V City Centre 2 to Airport are planned for commission upto Mar’2026. 3.9.4.6 Noapara - Baranagar – Dakshineswar Metro For Baranagar-Barrackpore & Dakshineswar and Noapara-Baranagar, the work was planned in 2 phases i.e.  the first phase being Noapara-Baranagar-Dakshineswar and in the second phase, from Baranagar- Barrackpore. The first phase, i.e. from Noapara to Dakshineswar, the Metro corridor has been inaugurated and dedicated to the Nation by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 22.02.2021 for public use. For the second phase of this Metro corridor, i.e. Baranagar-Barrackpore, a MoU was signed between State Government, Metro Railway and RVNL in October 2011. Original sanctioned alignment via B.T. Road was not agreed by State Govt. despite signing of the MoU in Oct’ 2011 for closing of 2 pipelines and even after completion of new pipeline work of 64" dia by State Govt. Repeated observations raised by KMC have been complied by RVNL. However, technical approval/NOC from State Govt. is still awaited.

The loan was fully disbursed on 29 th  October 2021 and the loan account was closed effective on 2 nd December 2021. Project Completion Report (PCR) submitted to ADB and loan is fully closed. 3.12 Contracting: As the size of projects being executed by RVNL is quite large, to ensure fast award and execution of projects, RVNL invites tenders consisting of multiple packages.  Each tender may consist of upto 3 contract packages.  This approach has a number of advantages such as: a) Multiple contracts can be awarded through one tender which saves time and effort in invitation and finalization of tenders. b) Both small and large agencies can compete for any contract package which increases competition. c) Large agencies who are capable of executing big contracts can quote for multiple packages to achieve economy of scale and pass on the benefit to RVNL by quoting discounts in case of award of more than one package. d) Smaller agencies, which would not be eligible to quote if the tender for the project was floated in a single package, are now able to compete in any of the contract packages individually as they may meet the qualification requirements of individual packages which are of comparatively smaller value. During 2024-25, contracts worth approximately  Rs. 5520.32 Cr.  were awarded.

123 Industry Structure and Development: India’s logistic market is more than 300 billion dollar and the logistic cost is around 16% of the country’s economy. To meet the demands of growing economy and to be at par with International standards, the logistic cost has to come down to 8%. The Indian logistic market is poised for significant growth, with estimates suggesting it will reach 484 billion dollar by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8%. Gol has taken initiative by notifying the logistic policy in Oct. 2021. One of the pillar as highlighted in the logistic policy is —’Ease of Logistics (ELOG)’ by developing more and more of Railway Infrastructures. India has the fourth largest Railway network in the world with a total length of 69181 route kilometer (rkm). Indian Railways runs a staggering number of trains daily, exceeding 22,000, out of which around 13198 are passenger trains that carry more than 18.87 millions passengers and about 11,724 freight trains that carry around 4.34 million tonnes of freight per day. The humungous magnitude of operations on Indian Railway can be appreciated from the fact that every day it moves people nearly equal to the population of Australia. In the recent past, various railway reforms have been initiated at the organisational and functional level to enhance efficiency, safety, innovations and transparency and to achieve faster project execution. Participative models for rail connectivity, introduction of private train operators and the focus on encouraging participation of the private sector in infrastructure upgradation and station development are noteworthy reforms. Indian Railways has prepared a National Rail Plan (NRP) for India - 2030 which envisages to create a “Future Ready” Railway system. The NRP is aimed to formulate strategies based on both operational capacities and commercial policy initiatives to increase modal share of the Railways in freight to 45%. The objective of the Plan is to create capacity ahead of demand by 2030. As part of this Plan, Vision 2024 has been launched for accelerated implementation of certain critical projects by 2024 such as electrification, multi-tracking of congested MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT routes, upgradation of speed to 160 kmph on certain routes, upgradation of speed to 130 kmph on all other Golden quadrilateral - Golden Diagonal routes and elimination of all Level Crossings on such routes. While new sections are being progressively commissioned for traffic in the Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight Corridors, new Dedicated Freight Corridors have been identified and expansion of rail networks in Jammu and Kashmir and North Eastern region of the country is being emphasized. Railways a net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. Many new improvements, such as self-designed Vande Bharat Express, Tejas Express, Vista dome Coaches, new Signalling Systems, Long Haul Freight Trains, High Capacity and High-Speed wagons, Kisan Rail, Solar powered passenger coaches etc have been undertaken to bring about sea change in customer comforts and expectations. Innovative improvements are also being brought upon by assimilating new technologies in the form of SMART Coaches, SMART Locomotives, SMART Yards, Automated Train Examination System, Automatic Train Protection, Centralized Traffic Control and Train Management System etc. Deployment of Anti-Collision Device (ACD) Network (Raksha Kavach) in the entire length and breadth of Indian Railway is another major initiative to ensure safety in rail travels. Indian Railways is considered the country’s lifeline for transporting passengers as well as cargo. To remain competitive vis-å-vis other transportation modes and to provide optimum level of service to passengers and for freight, there is an acute need to invest in railway infrastructure to augment capacity, expand the network and make it more efficient and customer centric. Role of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited: Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Navratna CPSE under the Ministry of Railways, has created state- of the-art rail transport capacity and has been a key player in India’s Infrastructure development since its inception in 2003. RVNL is executing projects on a fast track basis by adopting international project execution, construction, management practices and standards. RVNL has completed over 157 projects contributing Annexure- “A” 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 124 significantly to the nation’s railway network and economic growth. RVNL was incorporated with an objective to undertake rail project development, mobilization of financial resources and implementation of rail projects pertaining to strengthening of golden quadrilateral and port connectivity and raising of extra- budgetary resources for project execution. RVNL is in the business of executing all types of railway projects including new lines, doubling, 3 rd line/4 th  line, gauge conversion, railway electrification, metro projects, workshops, mega bridges, hilly railway projects, construction of cable stayed bridges, institutional buildings etc. RVNL has been functioning as an executing arm of Indian Railways and works for and on behalf of the Ministry for projects assigned to it for execution. It generally works on a turnkey basis and undertakes the full cycle of project development from conceptualization to commissioning including stages of design, preparation of estimates, calling and award of contracts, project and contract management, etc. The projects are spread all over the country and for efficient implementation of projects, 29 Project Implementation Units (PIUs) established at 25 locations to execute projects in their geographical hinterland. They are located at Ahmedabad, Ambala, Agra, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, Chennai, Chandigarh, Guwahati, Jhansi, Kanpur, Kolkata, Kharagpur, Kota, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Pune, Raipur, Rishikesh, Ranchi, Secunderabad, Varanasi and Waltair. Two Operational units are also established outside India, one is at Maldives & another is at Rwanda. The PIUs are established and closed as per requirement. RVNL’s major client is the Indian Railways and other clients include various central and state government ministries, departments, and public sector undertakings. RVNL is also participating in Metro, Highways, Roadways, Ports, Transmission line, Irrigation, Signalling works, MMLPs and other infrastructure sectors through competitive bidding. In last 3 years, there has been a paradigm shift in functioning of RVNL. RVNL has gone into the market for winning projects through bidding. Till 31 of March, 2025 it has participated in bids worth more than Rs. 2,27,000 crores of projects, and has won Projects/ awarded/ declared L1 for about Rs. 49,000 Crore. The first two projects won by RVNL in the open market, viz. Indore Metro projects have progressed extremely well. Since 2021, RVNL has diversified by winning large number of projects in different sectors such as Metro segment, Irrigation, Road Sector, Municipal Corporation (Ahmedabad). First overseas project in Maldives is  also progressing very well. Thus, RVNL has transformed itself from #LocalRaillnfra to #GlobalRaillnfra. RVNL combines the efficiency of Private Sector and trustworthiness of Govt. Sector. In last 14 years, RVNL have been rated excellent by DPE which is a huge recognition by GOI and it is a manifestation of persistent excellence. For RVNL, excellence is a prevailing attitude and not an exception. RVNL has been pioneer and trail blazer for PPP model for creation of Rail Infrastructure. RVNL has commissioned more than 16,500 KM of Railway infrastructure. The project expenditure was Rs. 1.75 lakh as on 31.03.2025. Disinvestment of Government of India holding in RVNL: IPO (April 2019)- 12.16% OFS (March, 2021)- 9.64%, OFS (July, 2023)- 5.36%, As part of its original mandate, RVNL has successfully set up five project specific Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) for execution of important rail connectivity projects in PPP mode. Five SPVs have already been commissioned for traffic. More SPVs are in different stages of being set up under Indian Railways’  participative policy framework. RVNL had recognised the vast potential for building a High-Speed Rail Network in the country and with the approval of President of India, had formed High Speed Rail Corporation of India Ltd. (HSRC), as its subsidiary. Feasibility studies for Delhi-Kolkata, Delhi-Mumbai, Mumbai-Chennai and Delhi- Chandigarh Amritsar have been undertaken by HSRC. Subsequently, HSRC has been renamed as HSRC Infra Services  Limited (HSRCISL) and repurposed to manage in bidding of projects for RVNL and to provide project management consultancy services. Swot Analysis Strengths RVNL has successfully mobilized funds for the construction of new lines by creating project specific SPVs with strategic stakeholders. Its large capital base can be leveraged to raise funds as per its original mandate. 

125 Ministry of Railways has delegated the authority to RVNL for sanctioning of estimates within prescribed limits and for awarding contracts of any value for the projects in hand enabling RVNL to implement projects faster. As RVNL can award large value contracts, it has been able to attract the best infrastructure companies in India. It has developed expertise in undertaking all stages of project development - from concept to commissioning. RVNL has built the requisite skills and experience to follow ADB procedures for contracting and ensure resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected persons to implement socio-economic safeguards. It has introduced large-scale mechanization in all aspects of construction to achieve high quality output. It has refined its tendering processes and introduced innovative concepts like multi- package tenders resulting in faster decision making and savings in overall costs It has a sound and robust financial management system, allowing for effective monitoring and control of expenditure. HSRCISL, a subsidiary of RVNL, is available to provide consultancy service and also for implementation of high-speed corridors in the time to come. RVNL has set up a Business Development Cell to participate in competitive bidding process in Infrastructure Sector. Weaknesses RVNL used to be dependent on the Ministry of Railways for funding of projects which is critical for the future growth of the Company and for timely implementation of projects. RVNL is also depending upon MOR on sanction of the revised estimates. RVNL has not been notified as a Zonal Railway and accordingly does not have the authority to approve drawings, designs etc. As per the MOU executed in October 2003, RVNL was mandated for obtaining sanction from Commissioner of Railway Safety but subsequently the same was withdrawn in November 2007. Authority for CRS sanction shall expedite the project commissioning and enhance the project delivery. The progress of projects often gets impaired on account of delays in securing the necessary approvals for plans, granting of traffic blocks, etc. from Zonal Railways. Changes in approved plans by the Railways, during execution of projects, result in delays. RVNL has to depend on Railways for traffic blocks for execution of projects which causes delays. The projects taken from market are new and likely to face new kind of challenges. Opportunities RVNL is implementing Rishikesh — Karnaprayag project in the Himalayan region and can also take up more such projects in hilly terrain and also projects located at strategic locations, With the work of execution of Kolkata Metro projects, RVNL has developed expertise for implementation of metro projects in other cities across the Country. RVNL has successfully constructed major workshops for Indian Railways in fast track mode. RVNL can thus undertake implementation of large buildings, factories, townships etc. for other agencies as well. With RVNL’s growth as a major provider of a variety of rail infrastructure, there is an opportunity of securing rail infrastructure projects overseas. RVNL can play a significant role in raising extra-budgetary resources for project execution as this is a specific mandate of the Company and has experience of implementation of projects in PPP mode. RVNL has already shown capabilities in execution of marine works in overseas. Threats The shortage of technical manpower in market/Railways with required experience in the Rail sector, is a major constraint in the delivery of projects. A large percentage of RVNL workforce are deputationists from Indian Railways. Any adverse policy decision may result in railway officers not being available for deputation. 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 126 Land acquisition issues require to be resolved expeditiously so that the progress of projects is not hampered. Delays in clearances for project execution such as tree-cutting, removal of utilities from the construction of viaducts for metro rail projects etc. A number of projects are being executed along existing running lines, which makes safety a serious challenge. Projects are adversely affected due to poor law and order conditions such as those in Left Wing Extremists affected districts. Stoppage of work by MOR on nomination basis and withdrawal of power to sanction estimates. Not following the approved revenue stream at the stage of revised estimate shall affect the financials of RVNL. Industrial Relations:  Industrial Relations remained harmonious and cordial. Strategies The Company is taking measures for ensuring cost control and timely delivery of projects, without any compromise on quality for the execution and delivery of rail infrastructure projects on a fast track basis. RVNL can play a significant role in Ministry of Railways’ efforts of raising extra-budgetary resources for project implementation, especially through the SPV route. Innovative models for project financing will also have to be explored. RVNL has also requested Ministry of Railways’ that it may be permitted to leverage its equity base to raise funds from the market as per its mandate. RVNL has created a permanent cadre through absorption to provide institutional continuity and to reduce the dependence on seeking officers and staff on deputation from Railways. Most of the workforce consists of qualified technical staff with experience in Railways and/or its PSUs. Wherever required, RVNL has also recruited specialists to provide expert guidance in its project implementation. A comprehensive and appropriate training programme is being implemented to develop competent, suitably skilled and qualified manpower. Efforts are also being made to transfer skills and best practices from other infrastructure sectors and acquiring skills related to execution of Railway projects. The Mission, Vision and Objectives of the Company are mentioned below: Mission To be a leading Construction Company of India with presence in all infrastructure domains, both within the country and outside. Vision To build world-class durable infrastructures with the latest technologies and designs following the best quality and safety standards. Objectives To undertake and execute successfully project development, financing and implementation of projects relating to infrastructure of all kind. To build, maintain, sustain, project implementation teams, ready to launch execution of projects won, with commitments to timely execution and highest level of technical standards. To mobilise financial and human resources for project implementation timely execution of projects with least cost escalation. To maintain a cost-effective organisational setup. To foster a culture of continuous learning within the Organisation, and to constantly upgrade to innovative technologies and collaborative practices, in order to build and sustain a future-ready work force and managerial platform. To permeate a philosophy of sustainability within the Organisation, by a continuous internal conversation with employees, partners, associates and consultants, and to promote professional integrity, mutual trust & care. Outlook The Company proposes to expand its operations independently and through its Subsidiary Company which will undertake the siding construction, siding maintenance, procurement of machines for operation and maintenance, PMC/GC services, solar panel work, Transmission line work, Export of wagon/coaches, Cranes etc, construction of Metro and HSRC and also include biding in the open market and thus it would be bidding arm of the parent Company i.e. RVNL. Concerns Over a period of time, it is noticed that there is a huge outstanding share of project expenditure due 

127 from State Government/Union Government e.g. Government of Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra.  Such committed funds from State and Union Government have got bearings on project delivery. Delays in land acquisition, finalization of plans by users, timely clearance of permissions from other government departments (mainly Ministry of Environment and Forests), law and order problems, and the continued support from Ministry of Railways are main concern areas in project execution.  The capacity constraints of agencies capable of delivery of large value rail infrastructure projects will also have to be addressed to ensure the successful and timely completion of projects. Internal Control Systems Effective internal control systems have been put in place for monitoring the implementation of projects including periodic reviews of the physical and financial progress, evaluation of efficiency of cost control measures based on inputs of both the Technical and Finance Departments. Reviews of the progress and nature of expenditure is regularly conducted by the Finance and Accounts Department and reports thereon are submitted to Management.  Budgetary reviews are also conducted. The Company has laid down and developed a framework of internal financial controls, with reference to financial statements and reporting and such controls are adequate and operating effectively.  A system of internal audit by an external firm ensures the efficacy of control systems and also submission of comments on the appropriateness of incurrence of expenditure, and their accountal by the Company.  The reports of the internal auditor are periodically reviewed by Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and implementation of recommendations are monitored. The Annual Accounts of the Company are also subject to scrutiny by the Statutory Auditor appointed by CAG and Audit by CAG. Financial Performance (Standalone Financial) The Company recorded total income of Rs.20,888.24 crore compared to Rs. 22,915.13 crore in the previous year. Profit after tax for the year 2024-25 is Rs 1,188.62 crore as against Rs. 1,462.95 crore in the previous year. During the financial year, the Company has earned a turnover of Rs 19,869.35 crore as against Rs. 21,732.58 crore of previous year. Key Financial Ratios: S.

253 Independent Auditor’s Report TO THE MEMBERS OF RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of  RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED , (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”), which comprise of the Standalone Balance Sheet as at 31   March 2025, the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Standalone Statement of Changes in Equity and the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the standalone financial statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended and accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31   March 2025, its profit including other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and its cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules there under, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements. Emphasis of Matter We draw your attention to the following matters: a. The Company usually receives advance payment from Joint Venture Companies for incurring expenditure on their projects. However, in the case of one joint venture company i.e. Krishnapatnam Railway Company Limited (KRCL), the Company is incurring project expenditure on a regular basis, but nominal amount has been received from KRCL during the year and the total amount receivable from KRCL as on 31 March 2025 is Rs.1355.72 crore which includes Rs. 889.95 crore on account of Interest on delayed payment. The application of interest has been changed from compound to simple w.e.f 1 st  October 2024, whereas  KRCL requested for application of simple interest w.e.f. 01.04.2020 in lieu of compounding interest. The matter is pending with the Board of Directors of the Company and adjustment if any will be recognized as and when the matter is finalized. (refer note nos. 11.1, 11.6 & 46 to the standalone financial statements). b. In view of the representation made by one of the Joint Venture Company KRCL for waiver of departmental charges and pending decision by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, the claim for departmental charges@ 5% of the completion cost of the project has not been raised on KRCL by the Company. Also during the year the methodology of application of interest has been changed from compound to simple we.f. 1st October 2024 in case of KRCL.(refer note no. 46 to the standalone financial statements). 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 254 c . Balances of some of the Trade Receivables, Other Assets, Trade and Other Payable accounts are subject to confirmation/ reconciliation from the respective parties. The management does not expect to have any material differences affecting the financial statements for the year ended 31March 2025 (refer note no. 52 to the standalone financial statements). Our opinion is not modified in respect of the matters mentioned in the above paragraphs. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Sr. Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key No. Audit Matter 1. Revenue Recognition in terms of Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” Accounting Standard on Revenue which prescribes five steps revenue recognition model.The Company recognizes revenue for a performance obligation satisfied over time after estimating its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. There are significant accounting judgements in estimating revenue to be recognised on contracts with customers, including estimation of costs to complete. The Company recognises revenue on the basis of stage of completion in proportion of the contract costs incurred at balance sheet date, relative to the total estimated costs of the contract at completion. The recognition of revenue is therefore dependent on estimates in relation to the total estimated costs of each such contract.During order fulfilment, contractual obligations may need to be reassessed. In addition, change orders or cancellations have to be considered. As a result, total estimated project costs may exceed total contract revenues and therefore require immediate recognition ofthe expected loss. Ind AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgement, taking into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their customers. The application of the revenue accounting standard involves certain key judgements relating to - i. identification of distinct performance obligations. ii. determination of transaction price of the identified performance obligations. iii. the appropriateness of the basis used to measure revenue recognized at a point in time or over time. Our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the Company’s revenue recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with the policies in terms of the applicable accounting standards. We evaluated the effectiveness of control over the preparation of information that are designed to ensure completeness and accuracy. We selected a sample of contracts, and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal control, relating to identification of the distinct performance obligations and satisfaction of performance obligations. We also examined costs incurred vis a vis the estimated cost to complete the contract and tested their recoverability by comparing the same with the contract revenue. We performed following substantive procedures over revenue recognition with specific focus on whether there is single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations in the contract and whether the performance obligation is being satisfied over the period of time or at a point in time: · Read, analyzed and identified the distinct performance obligations in these contracts. · Compared these performance obligations with that identified and recorded by the Company. · Considered the terms of the contracts to verify the transaction price used to allocate to separate performance obligations. · Checked whether the performance obligation is being satisfied over the period of time or at a point in time. 

255 Sr. Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key No. Audit Matter Additionally, the revenue accounting standard contains disclosures which involve collation of information in respect of disaggregated revenue and periods over which the remaining performance obligations will be satisfied subsequent to the balance sheet date. Revenue recognition from these judgements were identified as a Key Audit Matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Note no. 2.10 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements. 2. Provisions and Contingent liabilities relating to ongoing litigations The Company is subject to a number of legal, arbitration and tax cases for which final outcome cannot be easily predicted and which could potentially result in significant liabilities. The assessment of whether liability is recognised as a provision or disclosed as a contingent liability in the standalone financial statements is inherently subjective and requires significant management judgement in determination of the cash outflows from the business, interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and careful examination of pending assessments at various levels. Since the amounts involved are significant and due to the range of possible outcomes leading to high estimation uncertainty that requires significant management and auditor judgement, this matter is considered to be a key audit matter for the current year audit. Refer Note no. 38 to the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements read with accounting policy 2.17 & 2.18. Performed analytical procedures for reasonableness of revenues disclosed Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to the following: • Obtained understanding of the process of identification and measurement of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to ongoing litigation implemented by the Management, through various discussions held with Company’s finance personnel. • Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls put in place by the management in relation to assessment of the outcome of the pending litigations. • Inspected the summary of litigation matters and discussed key developments during the year with the Company’s Finance personnel. • Inspected and evaluated, where applicable, external legal and/or regulatory advice sought by the Company. • Discussed and challenged the management’s assessment of the likelihood, magnitude and accounting of any liability that may arise in certain material cases. Accordingly, we reviewed the amount of provisions recognized and contingent liabilities disclosed in the standalone financial statements and exercised our professional judgement to assess the appropriateness of such conclusions, involving experts as required. • Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures made in the Company’s standalone financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 256 Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Director’s Report including Annexures to Director’s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available to us and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read such other information as and when made available to us and if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 

257 collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatement that, individually or in aggregate, makes it’s probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably acknowledgeable user of the statement may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the statement. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Other Matters 1.

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 268 Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management’sResponsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Annexure - C to the independent Auditors’ Report Referred to in paragraph 3(f) to “Report on Other legal and regulatory requirements” of the Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the members of RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED on the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025. 

269 (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,an adequate internal financial controls with reference tostandalone financial statements, except control over monitoring of the estimated cost of completion of projectand such internal financial controls withreference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on thecriteria for internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements established by theCompany considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit ofInternal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. We have considered the areas of improvement identified which needs further strengthening as reported in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of standalone financial statements of the Company. However, these areas of improvement do not affect our opinion on the standalone financial statements of the Company.

As on 31 st  March 2025   Rail Vikas Nigam Limited holds 49.76% equity shares in KPRCL. The work was executed in three phases. The execution of the construction work was undertaken by RVNL. As per the construction agreement, KPRCL was to pay quarterly advances to RVNL for execution of the work. but due to dispute between MoR and KRCL regarding apportionment of revenue from traffic receipts, KRCL have not able to generate enough revenue to finance the construction work through RVNL. But as the contracts had already been awarded by RVNL, commitments had to be met out of its own source. Also, as per the terms and conditions of the concession agreement stopping of works would have resulted into bigger loss to RVNL.The pace of payment by KRCL has been improving as the movement on this project has been increasing continuously. It is expected that sufficient revenue will be generated and KRCL will be paying back the balance due to RVNL along with interest as per the construction agreement. During the financial year 2024-25, the application of interest has been changed from compound to simple w.e.f 1st October 2024, whereas KRCL requested for application of simple interest w.e.f. 01.04.2020 in lieu of compounding interest. The matter is pending with the Board of Directors of the Company and adjustment if any will be recognized as and when the matter is finalized. Further, during the year 2024- 25, Rs. 219.74 crore were received.Authorities of KRCL are being pursued for arranging payments to RVNL. As per the construction agreement between RVNL and KRCL, it has been decided to charge departmental charges (5%) on completion of project i.e. on the basis of completion report finalization. As per para 1705 of Engineering code of Indian Railway “the completion Report of a project should be submitted to Railway Board within 18 months after the end of financial half year in which completion estimate is submitted. It is submitted that this project is not yet completed in full respect and hence charging of departmental charges is not yet due. 

271 These are mainly advances to Zonal Railways given either for execution of works on behalf of RVNL or supply of sleepers and rails for utilization in RVNL projects, which is a regular process. Zonal Railways are advised to give accountal of the advance given but confirmations of outstanding balances from some Zonal Railways were not received in spite of repeated requests. The advance was given to Electricity Companies for either power supplies or for shifting of cables in connection with the projects against which the accountal is received on completion of the work. Payables mainly include funds received from MoR pending adjustment and security deposits/retention monies.Management does not expect to have any material financial impact of such pending confirmations/reconciliations. S. Emphasis of Matter Management Reply No. 3. Balances of some of the Trade Receivables, Other Assets, Trade and Other Payable accounts are subject to confirmation/reconciliation from the respective parties. The management does not expect to have any material differences affecting the financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2025 (refer note no. 52 to the standalone financial statements).

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

Debt instrument at FVTOCI A debt instrument is classified at FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: • The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets and • The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI. Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value.

However the company recognizes interest income Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements For the year ended 31 March 2025 

285 impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L.

Debt instrument at FVTPL FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets. Any financial assets which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI is classified at FVTPL. In addition the Company may elect to designate financial asset which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria at FVTPL, if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency. The Company has not designated any financial asset at FVTPL. Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L. Investment in Equity instruments are measured through FVTOCI. d. Equity Instrument at FVTOCI Financial Assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and setting financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and invest in the principal amount  outstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading. (ii) Financial liabilities a) Financial liabilities at Amortised Cost Financial liabilities at amortised cost represented by trade and other payables security deposits and retention money are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. b) Financial liabilities at FVTPL The company has not designated any financial liabilities at FVTPL. (C) Derecognition Financial Asset A financial asset (or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is  derecognized only when the contractual rights to the  cash flows from the asset expires or it transfers the financial assets and substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset. Financial Liability A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. (D) Impairment of financial assets Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss. The Company follows simplified approach for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivable. The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date right from its initial recognition Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The impairment methodology applies on whether there has been significant increase in credit risk. Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements For the year ended 31 March 2025

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit credit method) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognised within the statement of financial position.

Increase in salary increase rate assumption in future valuations will also increase the liability. B) Investment Risk – If Plan is funded then assets liabilities mismatch & actual investment return on assets lower than the discount rate assumed at the last valuation date can impact the liability. C) Discount Rate : Reduction in discount rate in subsequent valuations can increase the plan’s liability. D) Mortality & disability – Actual deaths & disability cases proving lower or higher than assumed in the valuation can impact the liabilities. E) Withdrawals – Actual withdrawals proving higher or lower than assumed withdrawals and change of withdrawal rates at subsequent valuations can impact Plan’s liability.

Based on this evaluation the fair value of such payables are not materially different from their carrying amount. iii) The fair values of office security deposits, other assets, and items like liquidated damages and penalties is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using current market interest rates. For FY 2024–25, a 7.70% SBI fixed deposit rate is used for financial assets, and a 10.33% SBI lending rate is used for financial liabilities. These are reported under Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, given the use of unobservable factors, including credit risk of counterparties.

Valuation of Investment of Indian Port Rail & Ropeway Corporation Limited is based on the latest available financial statements as on 31 March 2024. vii) Based on an expert opinion and further analysis of the underlying contractual arrangements, and in accordance with Paragraph 62(c) of Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company has determined that security deposits and retention money are primarily performance-related. As these do not constitute a significant financing component, discounting of these balances is no longer considered appropriate. Accordingly, this reassessment has been classified as a change in accounting estimate under Ind AS 8, applied prospectively from the current financial year. As a result of the change in accounting estimate, the net impact on the current year’s Statement of Profit and Loss is a decrease in profit amounting to Rs.1.86 crore. The Company expects that similar treatment will apply to comparable balances in future periods. However, due to variability in contract terms and differences in timing and structure of future arrangements, it is impracticable to reliably estimate the exact quantitative impact on future periods. Fair Value hierarchy Level 1- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2- Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived form prices) Level 3- Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) Fair value hierarchies of assets and liabilities as on 31 March, 2025 are as follows: As at 31 March 2025 (Rs.

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 312 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements For the year ended 31 March 2025 (iii) Financial risk management The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise Borrowings from IRFC, trade payable and other payables. The Company’s principal financial assets include trade and lease receivables and cash & cash equivalents that are derived directly from its operations. The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risk are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies and risk objectives. The board of directors reviews the policies for managing each of these risk, which are summarised below:- a) Market Risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk includes loans and borrowing, deposits and other non derivative financial instruments. i) Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of change in market interest rate. The Company has only loan from IRFC, the payment of interest and repayment of principal of that is ensured by the Ministry of Railways; therefore the risk related to said loan is Nil , debt servicing will pass through RVNL books only. ii) Foreign Currency Risk The Company takes services from countries outside India for projects and is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from such foreign currency transactions. Due to immateriality of foreign exchange amount group does not hedge any risk. b) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its financial activities including deposits with banks, financial institutions and other financial instruments. There is negligible risk for receivable from Ministry of railways also company does not have any history of bad debts. Financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Company‘s policy. Investment of surplus are made with approved counterparty on the basis of the financial quotes received from the counterparty and as per the gudilines issued by DPE from time to time. c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring , as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company’s reputation. The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current operational requirements. Any short term- surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, are retained as cash and investment in short term deposits with banks. The said investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity. Note 33. Key sources of estimation uncertainty The followings are the key assumptions concerning the future, and the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities with next financial year. a) Fair valuation measurement and valuation process Impact of fair valuation of Staff loans and advances are immaterial therefore it has been continuing at the carrying value. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities is measured the valuation techniques including the DCF model. The inputs to these method are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. See Note 32 for further disclosures. b) Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and unabsorbed depreciation to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which losses can be utilised. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profit together with future tax planning strategies. c ) Borrowings from IRFC and Lease Receivables from Railway. Company has borrowed funds from Indian Railway Finance Corporation for the purpose of construction of railway projects. There is a moratorium period of 3 years for each year’s loan. During the said moratorium period, no amount on account of interest and principal shall be payable. The interest shall be charged on yearly basis and repayment of loan along with interest shall made be once in a year (for a period of 12 years) after the completion of moratorium period. Ministry of Railways would make available to RVNL the required funds thereafter, to enable them to do the debt servicing. The debt servicing will pass through RVNL books. Accordingly, funds are received by RVNL on each year from MoR and the same is transferred to IRFC. Therefore, there is no impact on Statement of Profit & Loss of the Company.

339 Independent Auditor’s Report TO THE MEMBERS OF RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of  RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED  (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding company”) and its subsidiaries ( the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”),its associate& joint ventures, which comprise of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2025, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income),the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the act, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rule 2015, as amended and accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its associate and joint ventures as at 31 March 2025, and their consolidated net profit (financial performance including other comprehensive income), their consolidated changes in equity, and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion, on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor in terms of their report referred in to paragraph 1 of the other matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statement. Emphasis of Matter We draw your attention to the following matters: a. The Holding Company usually receives advance payment from Joint Venture Companies for incurring expenditure on their projects. However, in the case of one joint venture company i.e. Krishnapatnam Railway Company Limited (KRCL), the Company is incurring project expenditures on a regular basis but nominal amount has been received from KRCL during the year and the total amount receivable from KRCL as on 31 March 2025 is Rs.1355.72 crore which includes Rs. 889.95 crore on account of Interest on delayed payment. The application of interest has been changed from compound to simple w.e.f 1 st  October 2024, whereas  KRCL requested for application of simple interest w.e.f. 01.04.2020. The matter is pending with the Board of Directors of the Holding Company and adjustment if any will be recognized as and when the matter is finalized (refer note nos. 11.1,11.6 & 46 to the consolidated financial statements). b. In view of the representation made by one of the Joint Venture Company KRCL for waiver of departmental charges and pending decision by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, the claim for departmental charges 5% of the completion cost of the project has not been raised on KRCL by the Company. The matter is pending with the Board of Directors of the Holding Company and adjustment if any will be recognized as and when the matter is 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 340 S r. Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key No. Audit Matter 1. Revenue Recognition in terms of Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” Accounting Standard on Revenue which prescribes five steps revenue recognition model.The Holding Company recognizes revenue for a performance obligation satisfied over time after estimating its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. There are significant accounting judgements in estimating revenue to be recognised on contracts with customers, including estimation of costs to complete. The Holding Company recognises revenue on the basis of stage of completion in proportion of the contract costs incurred at balance sheet date, relative to the total estimated costs of the contract at completion. The recognition of revenue is therefore dependent on estimates in relation to the total estimated costs of each such contract. During order fulfilment, contractual obligations may need to be reassessed. In addition, change orders or cancellations have to be considered. As a result, total estimated project costs may exceed total contract revenues and therefore require immediate recognition ofthe expected loss. Ind AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgement, taking into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their customers. The application of the revenue accounting standard involves certain key judgements relating to - i. identification of distinct performance obligations. Our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the Holding Company’s revenue recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with the policies in terms of the applicable accounting standards. We evaluated the effectiveness of control over the preparation of information that are designed to ensure the completeness and accuracy. We selected a sample of contracts, and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal control, relating to identification of the distinct performance obligations and satisfaction of performance obligations. We also examined costs incurred vis a vis the estimated cost to complete the contract and tested their recoverability by comparing the same with the contract revenue. We performed following substantive procedures over revenue recognition with specific focus on whether there is single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations in the contract and whether the performance obligation is being satisfied over the period of time or at a point in time: · Read, analyzed and identified the distinct performance obligations in these contracts. · Compared these performance obligations with that identified and recorded by the Holding Company. · Considered the terms of the contracts to verify the transaction price used to allocate to separate performance obligations. · Checked whether the performance finalized. (refer note no. 46 to the consolidated financial statements). c. Balances of some of the Trade Receivables, Other Assets, Trade and Other Payable accounts of the Holding Company are subject to confirmation/ reconciliation from the respective parties. The Holding Company’s management does not expect to have any material differences affecting the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 (refer note no. 51 to the consolidated financial statements). Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. Considering the requirement of Standard on Auditing (SA 600) on ‘Using the work of Another Auditor’ including materiality, below Key Audit Matters have been reproduced from the 

341 Sr. Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key No. Audit Matter ii. determination of transaction price of the identified performance obligations. iii. the appropriateness of the basis used to measure revenue recognized at a point in time or over time. Additionally, the revenue accounting standard contains disclosures which involve collation of information in respect of disaggregated revenue and periods over which the remaining performance obligations will besatisfied subsequent to the balance sheet date. Revenue recognition from these judgements were identified as a Key Audit Matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Note no. 2.10 to the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements. 2. Provisions and Contingent liabilities relating to ongoing litigations The Holding Company is subject to a number of legal, arbitration and tax cases for which final outcome cannot be easily predicted and which could potentially result in significant liabilities. The assessment of whether a liability is recognised as a provision or disclosed as a contingent liability in the standalone financial statements is inherently subjective and requires significant management judgement in determination of the cash outflows from the business, interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and careful examination of pending assessments at various levels. Since the amounts involved are significant and due to the range of possible outcomes leading to high estimation uncertainty that requires significant management and auditor judgement, this matter is considered to be a key audit matter for the current year audit. Refer Note no. 2.17, 2.18, 38 & 44 to the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements. obligation is being satisfied over the period of time or at a point in time. Performed analytical procedures for reasonableness of revenues disclosed Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to the following: • Obtained understanding of the process of identification and measurement of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to ongoing litigation implemented by the Management, through various discussions held with Holding Company’s finance personnel. • Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls put in place by the management in relation to assessment of the outcome of the pending litigations. • Inspected the summary of litigation matters and discussed key developments during the year with the Holding Company’s Finance personnel. • Inspected and evaluated, where applicable, external legal and/or regulatory advice sought by the Holding Company. • Discussed and challenged the management’s assessment of the likelihood, magnitude and accounting of any liability that may arise in certain material cases. Accordingly, we reviewed the amount of provisions recognized and contingent liabilities disclosed in the standalone financial statements and exercised our professional judgement to assess the appropriateness of such conclusions, involving experts as required. • Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures made in the Holding Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 342 Independent Auditors’ report on the audit of Standalone Financial Statements of the Holding Company. Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The other information includes the Director’s Report, Corporate Governance Report, Business Responsibility Report and Management Discussion and Analysis of Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Director’s Report, Corporate Governance Report, Business Responsibility Report and Management Discussion and Analysis of Annual Report are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available to us and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read such other information as and when made available to us and if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action, if required. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group, its Associate and Joint Ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”)  specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian accounting standards) Rules 2015 as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate and Joint Ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group, of its associate and Joint Ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, of its associate and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its associate and Joint Ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group, its associateor joint ventures or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, of its associate and joint ventures are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group, of its associate and Joint Ventures. Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 

343 aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company, its Subsidiaries, its associate and Joint Ventures incorporated in India have adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of the holding companies’ managements and Board of Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associate and Joint Ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group, its associateand joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its associate and Joint Ventures to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditor’s. For the other entity included in the consolidated financial statements, which has been audited by other auditor, such other auditor remains responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit carried out by him. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and quantitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Matters We draw attention to the following matters: 1) The Consolidated financial statements include the financial statements/information of 8 (Eight) Subsidiaries (including two Foreign Subsidiaries having no reportable financial data) included in consolidated financial statements, whose financial statements

351 Management Reply to the Emphasis of Matter of Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the F.Y.2024-25 S. Emphasis of Matter Management Reply No. 1. The Holding Company usually receives advance payment from Joint Venture Companies for incurring expenditure on their projects. However, in the case of one joint venture company i.e. Krishnapatnam Railway Company Limited (KRCL), the Company is incurring project expenditures on a regular basis but nominal amount has been received from KRCL during the year and the total amount receivable from KRCL as on 31st March 2025 is Rs.1355.72 crore which includes Rs. 889.95 crore on account of Interest on delayed payment. The application of interest has been changed from compound to simple w.e.f 1st October 2024, whereas KRCL requested for application of simple interest w.e.f. 01.04.2020. The matter is pending with the Board of Directors of the Holding Company and adjustment if any will be recognized as and when the matter is finalized (refer note nos. 11.1,11.6 & 46 to the consolidated financial statements). 2. In view of the representation made by one of the Joint Venture Company KRCL for waiver of departmental charges and pending decision by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, the claim for departmental charges 5% of the completion cost of the project has not been raised on KRCL by the Company. The matter is pending with the Board of Directors of the Holding Company and adjustment if any will be recognized as and when the matter is finalized. (refer note no. 46 to the consolidated financial statements). M/s Krishnapatnam Railways Company Limited (KRCL) is a Special Purpose Vehicle created especially for providing rail connectivity to Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh. As on 31 st  March 2025   Rail Vikas Nigam Limited holds 49.76% equity shares in KPRCL. The work was executed in three phases. The execution of the construction work was undertaken by RVNL. As per the construction agreement, KPRCL was to pay quarterly advances to RVNL for execution of the work. but due to dispute between MoR and KRCL regarding apportionment of revenue from traffic receipts, KRCL have not able to generate enough revenue to finance the construction work through RVNL. But as the contracts had already been awarded by RVNL, commitments had to be met out of its own source. Also, as per the terms and conditions of the concession agreement stopping of works would have resulted into bigger loss to RVNL.The pace of payment by KRCL has been improving as the movement on this project has been increasing continuously. It is expected that sufficient revenue will be generated and KRCL will be paying back the balance due to RVNL along with interest as per the construction agreement. During the financial year 2024-25, the application of interest has been changed from compound to simple w.e.f 1st October 2024, whereas KRCL requested for application of simple interest w.e.f. 01.04.2020 in lieu of compounding interest. The matter is pending with the Board of Directors of the Company and adjustment if any will be recognized as and when the matter is finalized. Further, during the year 2024- 25, Rs. 219.74 crore were received.Authorities of KRCL are being pursued for arranging payments to RVNL. As per the construction agreement between RVNL and KRCL, it has been decided to charge departmental charges (5%) on completion of project i.e. on the basis of completion report finalization. As per para 1705 of Engineering code of Indian Railway “the completion Report of a project should be submitted to Railway Board within 18 months after the end of financial half year in which completion estimate is submitted. It is submitted that this project is not yet completed in full respect and hence charging of departmental charges is not yet due. 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 352 S . Emphasis of Matter Management Reply No. 3. Balances of some of the Trade Receivables, Other Assets, Trade and Other Payable accounts of the Holding Company are subject to confirmation/ reconciliation from the respective parties. The Holding Company’s management does not expect to have any material differences affecting the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2025 (refer note no. 51 to the consolidated financial statements). These are mainly advances to Zonal Railways given either for execution of works on behalf of RVNL or supply of sleepers and rails for utilization in RVNL projects, which is a regular process. Zonal Railways are advised to give accountal of the advance given but confirmations of outstanding balances from some Zonal Railways were not received in spite of repeated requests. The advance was given to Electricity Companies for either power supplies or for shifting of cables in connection with the projects against which the accountal is received on completion of the work. Payables mainly include funds received from MoR pending adjustment and security deposits/retention monies.Management does not expect to have any material financial impact of such pending confirmations/reconciliations.

Taxes including current income-tax are computed using the applicable tax rates and tax laws. ii. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income. iii. Current income tax assets and liabilities for current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities Liability for additional taxes if any is provided / paid as and when assessments are completed. iv. Current tax related to OCI Item are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). b) Deferred tax i. Deferred income tax is recognized using balance sheet approach. i i.

Deferred tax related to OCI Item are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). 2.16 Leases The Company’s leased asset primarily consists of leases for land and buildings. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease at inception of a contract. The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 364 commencement date of the lease. Right-of- use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. • If ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. • The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Lease liabilities • The Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of future lease payments less any lease incentives receivable. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term or a change in the lease payments. • The Company applies the lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases contracts (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies to the recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2.17 Provisions Provision is recognised when: i ) The Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event ii) A probable outflow of resources is expected to settle the obligation and iii) A reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Reimbursement of the expenditure required to settle a provision is recognised as per contract provisions or when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received. Provisions are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date. a) Discounting of Provisions Provision which expected to be settled beyond 12 months are measured at the present value by using pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expenses. Onerous Contract Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognized and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the company has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. 2.18 Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (a) Contingent Liabilities are disclosed in either of the following cases:          i) A present obligation arising from a past event when it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; or         ii) A reliable estimate of the present obligation cannot be made; or         iii) A  possible obligation unless the probability of outflow of  resource is remote. (b) Contingent assets is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. (c) Contingent Liability and Provisions needed against Contingent Liability and Contingent Assets are reviewed at each Reporting date. (d) Contingent Liability is net of estimated provisions considering possible outflow on settlement. 2.19 Earnings Per Equity Share In determining earnings per share the Company considers the net profit attributable to equity shareholders. The number of shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. 2.20 Liquidated Damages and Penalties “Credit items arising on account of Liquidated Damages and Penalties during 

365 execution of contract or due to termination of contract etc. are carried as “Retained Amount for Damages A/c” under “Other Current Liabilities” until the management has decided either to levy or waive the same before financial closure of the project. Thereafter if these are not levied or waived by the management before financial closure of the project such leftover balances of liquidated damages and penalties etc. are credited to the total cost of the concerned project on financial closure of the project”. 2.21 Operating Segment An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make decisions for which discrete financial information is available. Based on the management approach as defined in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments. 2.22 Fair Value Measurement Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: • in the principal market for the asset or liability or • in the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. Financial Guarantee Contracts Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation. 2.23 Dividend to equity holders Dividend paid/payable shall be recognised in the year in which the related dividends are approved by shareholders or board of directors as appropriate. 2.24 Financial instruments:- (A) Initial recognition and measurement Financial Instruments are recognized at its fair value plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instruments. ( B) Subsequent measurement (i) Financial Assets Financial assets are classified in following categories: a ) At Amortised Cost b) Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. c) Fair value through Profit and loss account. a. Debt instrument at Amortised Cost A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: ( a) the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and 

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 366 ( b) The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method less impairment if any. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. b. Debt instrument at FVTOCI A debt instrument is classified at FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: • The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets and • The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI. Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). However the company recognizes interest income impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L. On de- recognition of the asset cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to P&L. Interest earned is recognised using the EIR method. c. Debt instrument at FVTPL FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets. Any financial assets which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI is classified at FVTPL. In addition the Company may elect to designate financial asset which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria at FVTPL, if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency. The Company has not designated any financial asset at FVTPL. Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L. Investment in Equity instruments are measured through FVTOCI. d. Equity Instrument at FVTOCI Financial Assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and setting financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and invest in the principal amount outstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading. (ii) Financial liabilities a) Financial liabilities at Amortised Cost Financial liabilities at amortised cost represented by trade and other payables security deposits and retention money are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. b) Financial liabilities at FVTPL The company has not designated any financial liabilities at FVTPL. (C) Derecognition Financial Asset A financial asset (or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is  derecognized only when the contractual rights to the  cash flows from the asset expires or it transfers the financial assets and substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset. Financial Liability A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. (D) Impairment of financial assets Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss. The Company follows simplified approach for recognition of 

367 impairment loss allowance on trade receivable. The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date right from its initial recognition Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The impairment methodology applies on whether there has been significant increase in credit risk. 2.25 Investment Property Properties that are held for long-term rental yields and / or for capital appreciation are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the straight line method so as to amortise the cost of investment properties over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made at the carrying amount when and only when there is a change in use. An item of investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of investment property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Income received from investment property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease 2.26 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent comprise cash at bank and on hand. It includes term deposits and short term money market deposits with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 2.27 Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses up to INR 5,00,000/- in each case are treated as expenditure/income of the year and accounted for to the naturalhead of accounts. 2.28 Prior period errors Errors/omissions discovered in the current year relating to prior periods are treated as immaterial and adjusted during the current year, if all such errors and omissions in aggregate does not exceed 1% of total operating revenue as per last audited financial statement of the Company. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated. 2.29 NEW STANDARDS/ AMENDMENTS AND OTHER CHANGES EFFECTIVE APRIL 1,2024 OR THEREAFTER Pursuant to the notifications issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs dated 9 September 2024 and 28 September 2024, the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, 2024 and Third Amendment Rules, 2024 were notified, amending the following standards effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2024: ( a) Ind AS 117 – Insurance Contracts; and (b) Ind AS 116 – Leases (amendments relating to lease liability in sale and leaseback transactions).

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit credit method) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognised within the statement of financial position.

Increase in salary increase rate assumption in future valuations will also increase the liability. B) Investment Risk – If Plan is funded then assets liabilities mismatch & actual investment return on assets lower than the discount rate assumed at the last valuation date can impact the liability. C) Discount Rate : Reduction in discount rate in subsequent valuations can increase the plan’s liability. D) Mortality & disability – Actual deaths & disability cases proving lower or higher than assumed in the valuation can impact the liabilities. E) Withdrawals – Actual withdrawals proving higher or lower than assumed withdrawals and change of withdrawal rates at subsequent valuations can impact Plan’s liability.

Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. Annual Report 2024-25 392 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 March 2025 iii) The fair values of office security deposits, other assets, and items like liquidated damages and penalties is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using current market interest rates. For FY 2024–25, a 7.70% SBI fixed deposit rate is used for financial assets, and a 10.33% SBI lending rate is used for financial liabilities. These are reported under Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, given the use of unobservable factors, including credit risk of counterparties. iv) Staff loans and advances have been continued at carrying value as measurement implications are immaterial. v) RVNL determined fair value of investment those are carried through Other Comprehensive Income through independent valuer. Valuation of Investment of Indian Port Rail & Ropeway Corporation Limited is based on the latest available financial statements as on 31 March 2024. vi) Based on an expert opinion and further analysis of the underlying contractual arrangements, and in accordance with Paragraph 62(c) of Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company has determined that security deposits and retention money are primarily performance-related. As these do not constitute a significant financing component, discounting of these balances is no longer considered appropriate. Accordingly, this reassessment has been classified as a change in accounting estimate under Ind AS 8, applied prospectively from the current financial year. As a result of the change in accounting estimate, the net impact on the current year’s Statement of Profit and Loss is a decrease in profit amounting to Rs.1.86 crore. The Company expects that similar treatment will apply to comparable balances in future periods. However, due to variability in contract terms and differences in timing and structure of future arrangements, it is impracticable to reliably estimate the exact quantitative impact on future periods. Fair Value hierarchy Level 1- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2- Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived form prices) Level 3- Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) Fair value hierarchies of assets and liabilities as on 31 March, 2025 are as follows: As at 31 March 2025 (Rs.

393 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 March 2025 (iii) Financial risk management The group’s principal financial liabilities comprise Borrowings from IRFC, trade payable and other payables. The group’s principal financial assets include trade and lease receivables and cash & cash equivalents that are derived directly from its operations. The group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risk are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the group’s policies and risk objectives. The board of directors reviews the policies for managing each of these risk, which are summarised below:- a) Market Risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk includes loans and borrowing, deposits and other non derivative financial instruments. i) Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of change in market interest rate. The group has only loan from IRFC, the payment of interest and repayment of principal of that is ensured by the Ministry of Railways; therefore the risk related to said loan is Nil , debt servicing will pass through RVNL books only. ii) Foreign Currency Risk The group  takes services from countries outside India for projects and is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from such foreign currency transactions. Due to immateriality of foreign exchange amount group does not hedge any risk. b) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group’s receivables from customers. The group is exposed to credit risk from its financial activities including deposits with banks, financial institutions and other financial instruments. There is negligible risk for receivable from Ministry of railways also group does not have any history of bad debts. Financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Company‘s policy. Investment of surplus are made with approved counterparty on the basis of the financial quotes received from the counterparty and as per the gudilines issued by DPE from time to time. c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring , as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the group’s reputation. The group’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The group believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current operational requirements. Any short term- surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, are retained as cash and investment in short term deposits with banks. The said investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity. Note 33. Key sources of estimation uncertainty The followings are the key assumptions concerning the future, and the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities with next financial year. a) Fair valuation measurement and valuation process Impact of fair valuation of Staff loans and advances are immaterial therefore it has been continuing at the carrying value. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities is measured the valuation techniques including the DCF model. The inputs to these method are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. See Note 32 for further disclosures. b) Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and unabsorbed depreciation to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which losses can be utilised. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profit together with future tax planning strategies. c ) Borrowings from IRFC and Lease Receivables from Railway. Company has borrowed funds from Indian Railway Finance Corporation for the purpose of construction of railway projects. There is a moratorium period of 3 years for each year’s loan. During the said moratorium period, no amount on account of interest and principal shall be payable. The interest shall be charged on yearly basis and repayment of loan along with interest shall made be once in a year (for a period of 12 years) after the completion of moratorium period. Ministry of Railways would make available to RVNL the required funds thereafter, to enable them to do the debt servicing. The debt servicing will pass through RVNL books. Accordingly, funds are received by RVNL on each year from MoR and the same is transferred to IRFC. Therefore, there is no impact on Statement of Profit & Loss of the Company.
