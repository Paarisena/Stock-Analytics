The electricity generation target (including  RE) for the year 2025-26 has been set at 2000 Billion Units,  representing a growth of around 9.3% over the actual  generation of 1830 billion units in the previous year. It is  estimated that the power sector needs an investment of  I 42  lakh crore by 2032. Driven by stable policies and massive investment, India’s  power sector is undergoing a large-scale expansion and a  rapid transition towards sustainable, clean energy to meet  its future needs. Leveraging our deep sectoral expertise and  financial strength, PFC will continue to champion this transition  and ensure the sustainable and resilient development of the  Indian power sector. Asset Quality and Risk Management: A  Strengthened Framework We continued to prioritise asset quality and risk prudence.  Our efforts over the past few years to strengthen monitoring,  recovery, and resolution mechanisms have yielded  positive results. Gross NPAs have declined to 1.94% in FY 2024-25, compared  to 3.34% last year. Net NPAs stood at just 0.39% — the lowest  in recent memory. Our provisioning coverage on Stage III  assets has improved to 80%, reinforcing our conservative and  forward-looking approach. A key success story was the resolution of the KSK Mahanadi  project, resulting in the full recovery of our outstanding  exposure. With disciplined lending practices and timely  interventions, we aim to maintain our record-low NPA  levels while continuing to support high-impact projects  across sectors. Smt.

(Standing from L to R) Letter to Shareholders Leadership in Renewable Energy and Sustainable  Financing PFC remains the largest renewable energy financier in India.  As of March 2025, our renewable energy loan book stood at  I 81,031 crore, representing a 35% year-over-year increase. I  am pleased to announce that PFC supported over 60 GW of  renewable capacity, which accounts for approximately 27% of  India’s total installed renewable capacity. We have more than doubled  our RE portfolio in the last five  years, in line with national  commitments under COP  and the Net Zero roadmap.  Sustainability and growth are  not mutually exclusive; instead,  they reinforce and complement  each other. Moving forward,  we will continue to support  the entire RE spectrum,  including solar, wind, hybrid,  green hydrogen, and storage  solutions. Our role as a financier goes beyond capital. We also provide  technical expertise, project development support, and policy  advocacy to accelerate India’s clean energy transition. Supporting Government Schemes and  Strengthening the Distribution Sector The distribution sector is the most critical link in the power  sector value chain. PFC continues to play a crucial role in  implementing government schemes that are central to India’s  power sector reforms. As the nodal agency for the Revamped  Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) and the Late Payment  Surcharge (LPS) mechanism, we have driven a tangible impact  on the ground. Under RDSS, tenders have been floated for the entire  sanctioned works, and awards have been placed for 90%  of the works. Our efforts in smart metering have led to the  awarding of contracts for 5.6 crore meters, representing 63%  of sanctioned meters. Electrification of 88,000 Households  has been completed out of the 2.2 lakh sanctioned, reflecting  our inclusive development agenda. Additionally, we have  imparted over 51,000 man-days of training to DISCOM  personnel across the country, enhancing their skills and  strengthening their operational capacity. Through the LPS mechanism, PFC has disbursed  I 45,180  crore to date to liquidate legacy dues. This has led to a 70%  reduction in dues from peak levels of  I 1.40 lakh crore. More  importantly, current dues are now being settled on time,  ensuring timely payments to generators and maintaining  liquidity in the power ecosystem. 28 29 Future-Focused. Responsibly-Led.

Our innovative debt management strategies reflect our  financial resilience and strategic foresight. By diversifying  our borrowing sources and launching innovative instruments,  we have optimised our funding costs and strengthened our  financial position. During the financial year, we mobilised over  I 1.11 lakh crore -  76% from the domestic market and 24% via foreign currency  borrowings, reflecting strong global investor confidence.  Strategic timing of fundraising and increased reliance on  low-cost sources helped optimise the overall cost of funds,  enhancing financial efficiency. Nearly 95% of our foreign  currency portfolio is fully hedged against exchange risk.  Through proactive liability management, we have continued  to replace high-cost borrowings with lower-cost instruments,  ensuring long-term financial resilience. Our global expansion efforts are a testament to our ambition  and potential. We are excited to explore new markets and  forge strategic partnerships that will further strengthen  our position as a global leader in power and infrastructure  financing. In a deal which marks the largest green financing  agreement ever executed by JBIC with any company in India,  a loan facility of JPY 120 billion has been extended to PFC to  finance its RE portfolio. In a landmark development, we  became the first government  NBFC in the infrastructure  and power lending space to  establish a wholly owned  foreign subsidiary at the IFSC in  GIFT City. This entity positions  PFC as a global player and  provides significant regulatory  and tax advantages, including  a 10-year 100% income tax  exemption and GST-free  services. Smt.

Letter to Shareholders Driving ESG and Community Impact Our ESG framework is built on three pillars: preserving the  planet, promoting inclusive growth, and pursuing governance  excellence. From energy-efficient projects to employee  diversity and stakeholder engagement, ESG considerations  are now integral to our decision-making process. Our second annual ESG Report, released this year, aligns all  disclosures with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Universal  Standards 2021. This step underscores our firm commitment  to strengthening transparency and accountability, ensuring  our reporting adheres to the highest global standards for  all stakeholders. Corporate Governance and Stakeholder  Engagement As a listed Maharatna PSU, PFC upholds the highest standards  of governance, transparency, and accountability.

We have robust internal controls and disclosure  systems that provide confidence to all our stakeholders.

Conclusion As we commemorate four decades of powering India’s  development, I would like to express my sincere gratitude  to all stakeholders – the Ministry of Power, the Board of  Directors, our employees, investors, clients, regulatory  bodies, and partners. Your steadfast support has enabled us  to achieve what we have. PFC is primed for the future.

This period saw  substantial additions to the transmission network, crucial  for evacuating power from remote generation sites,  particularly renewable energy projects, to consumption  centers across the nation.     A key highlight of FY 2024-25 was the significant increase  in commissioned transmission projects and line lengths.  India added an impressive 8,830 circuit kilometers (ckm)  of transmission lines. This shift towards higher capacity  will increase from 119 GW to 168 GW. This plan covers  the network of 220 kV and above. This plan will help in  meeting the increasing electricity demand, facilitate RE  integration and green hydrogen loads into the grid.     Further, 50.9 GW of Inter State Transmission Projects  costing  H 60,676 crore has been approved. The  transmission network required to connect 280 GW  of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) to the Inter-State  Transmission System (ISTS) by 2030 is planned to be 335  GW. The pictorial representation of the same is as under:       MoP  has  also  initiated  Tariff  Based  Competitive  Bidding Process for development and strengthening of  transmission system through private sector participation.     The objective of this initiative is to develop transmission  capacities in India and to bring in the potential  investors after developing such projects to a stage  having preliminary survey work, identification of route,  preparation of survey report, initiation of process of land  acquisition for sub-stations, if any, initiation of process of  seeking forest clearance, if required etc.     As on March 31, 2025, 101 SPVs (89 are related to inter- state transmission scheme and 12 are related to intra- state transmission scheme), 2 by your company and other  99 by its wholly-owned subsidiary (PFC Consulting Ltd.)  have been established for ITPs.   Distribution     Electricity distribution is a critically important segment  of the power sector. While generation plants produce  electricity and transmission lines move it over long  distances, it's the distribution system that brings  electricity directly to homes, businesses, and industries,  making it the final and most crucial link in the entire power  delivery chain.     The Government of India focused on power distribution  sector through reforms and initiatives. As a part of  it,  Electricity  Rules  were  notified  in  February  2024  to  empower electricity consumers. This framework lays  down their rights and provides mechanisms to enforce  them. The rules ensure timely access to services such  as new connections, grievance redressal, and billing  transparency while facilitating rooftop solar adoption  and electric vehicle (EV) integration. Key provisions  include: simplifying rooftop solar installation processes  with exemptions from technical feasibility study for  systems up to 10 kW; allowing separate connections for  EV charging stations to promote clean mobility; reducing  timelines for new connections: 3 days in metros, 7 days  in municipal areas, and 15 days in rural regions (30 days  for hilly terrain); mandating consumer rights for separate  metering and billing in residential colonies, enhancing  transparency and fairness; introducing mandatory check  meters to verify consumption in case of complaints.   Generation   Installed Capacity     For  the  fiscal  year  2024-25,  India's  power  generation  capacity, saw unprecedented growth, particularly in  the renewable energy sector. The nation achieved its  highest-ever annual capacity addition, with a remarkable  cumulative power generation capacity reaching 475.2  gigawatts (GW) by the end of the fiscal year. This expansion  signifies a substantial increase from the 249 GW recorded  in 2014, reflecting an almost doubling of capacity over  a decade.     The standout performance was in renewable energy which  alone contributed a record 29.52 GW of new capacity in  FY 2024-25. This brought the total installed renewable  energy capacity to 220.10 GW as of March 31, 2025, up  from 198.75 GW in the previous fiscal year demonstrating  a strong commitment to a greener energy mix. Solar  power was the primary driver of this growth, with 23.83  GW added during the fiscal year, pushing its total installed  capacity to 105.65 GW. Similarly, wind power saw a  significant boost with 4.15 GW added, culminating in a  total installed capacity of 50.04 GW. While thermal power,  predominantly coal-based, also experienced additions,  its proportional share in the overall mix continued to  decrease, settling at around 46.7% by the close of the  fiscal year. These comprehensive additions underscore  India's accelerated progress towards its ambitious target  of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy  capacity by 2030.

Threats, Risks & Concerns     PFC, as a major financial institution in the Indian power  sector,  is  inherently  exposed  to  various  financial  and  operational risks. PFC faces a multifaceted array of  threats and risks within the dynamic Indian power sector,  primarily stemming from the inherent complexities of the  industry and its ongoing transformation. Understanding  these specific risks and concerns faced by your company  are crucial: CHANGES IN  LEGISLATION LEGAL RISK INTEREST  RATE RISK FOREIGN  CURR ENCY   EXCHANGE  RISk LIQUIDITY  RISK CREDIT RISK   Credit Risk     Credit risk includes both the possibility of a borrower  defaulting on contractual obligations under a loan or  advance and the risk of loss resulting from a borrower's  declining credit rating. To evaluate and reduce credit risk,  your business uses a methodical institutional and project  appraisal approach.A thorough appraisal approach, risk  identification and appropriate structuring, and credit risk  mitigation techniques are some of these procedures.   Liquidity Risk     The maturity mismatch between the company's assets  and obligations is the main cause of liquidity risk.The  incapacity  of  the  business  to  finance  asset  growth,  handle unforeseen shifts in funding sources, and fulfill  commitments when needed are all examples of liquidity  risk. We might have to sell assets on unfavorable terms or  raise money. We use a variety of tactics to control liquidity  risk, such as proactive resource mobilization based on  anticipated payments and maturing commitments.   Foreign Currency Exchange Risk     Exchange rate fluctuations between currencies that could  negatively  affect  the  value  of  assets,  liabilities,  and  of  balance sheet arrangements denominated in foreign  currencies are known as foreign currency exchange  risk. We may be subject to foreign exchange rate risk as  a result of our foreign currency borrowings. Lending in  foreign currencies and using derivative instruments (such  currency futures, options, principal-only swaps, interest  rate swaps, and forward rate agreements) provided by  banks that are authorized dealers are two ways to manage  foreign exchange risk.   Legal Risk     The uncertainty surrounding the legality of contracts  pertaining to our borrowers' responsibilities gives rise to  legal risk. This can be the result of a delayed enforcement  process or a problem with the application of contractual  responsibilities. By creating legal documents that are as  protective of our interests as possible, we aim to reduce  legal risk.   Interest Rate Risk     Interest rates fluctuate and are influenced by a number  of internal and external factors, such as the cost of  borrowing, market liquidity, competitive rates, changes  in benchmarks like AAA bond/GSEC yields, and changes  to  RBI  policy.  The  company's  financial  situation  will  suffer  from  changes  in  market  interest  rates.  Timing  discrepancies represent the company's main interest rate- related concerns. By analyzing interest rate sensitivity gap  statements and assessing the development of assets and  liabilities with a combination of fixed and floating interest  rates, interest rate risk is controlled.   Changes in Legislation     According to the Companies Act, PFC is a financial institution  under the Companies Act. It was designated as an IFC in  July 2010 and is registered with the RBI as a non-deposit  taking systemically important NBFC.

A comprehensive understanding of an organization’s performance, strategy, and effects on different capitals— financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social, and natural—is what this method seeks to deliver. This voluntary disclosure explains our reliance on and influence on the forms of capital that are essential to our capacity to  generate value over the long run. It is organized according to the capitals model of value creation, which was adopted by the  International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) in the International Framework. According to the framework mentioned above, the capitals are divided into six categories: Financial, Manufactured, Intellectual,  Human, Social & Relationship and Natural. FINANCIAL CAPITAL An  organization’s  available  finances  for  usage  in  the  manufacturing of commodities or the supply of services are  collectively referred to as financial capital. Equity, loans, grants,  and  any  other  type  of  financial  instrument  fall  under  this  category. It is necessary for business operations, new project  investments, and sustainability in general. An organization’s  capacity to produce future financial gains is impacted by its  ability to manage financial capital effectively. This capital is  crucial because it may be converted into other types of capital,  such as manufactured, natural, human, social, and intellectual  assets, and it also acts as a means of trade. Dividends and interest on debt instruments are distributed  to  shareholders  from  the  accrued  financial  capital.  Various  taxes are paid to the government, which supports our nation’s  general development.

No Material issue  identified Indicate  whether Risk or  opportunity (R/O) Rationale for identifying the risk / opportunity In case of risk,  approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial implications of the risk or  opportunity (Indicate positive or  negative implications) 1 Regulatory  and Legal  Compliance Risk Risk - The threat of non-compliance puts the  organisation at risk of incurring legal penalties  and financial losses due to its inability to follow  industry laws and regulations. Failing to comply  with these laws would have a direct impact  on the company’s revenue and valuation,  potentially resulting in a tarnished reputation  and lost business opportunities. More compliant  companies typically experience enhanced  performance and greater efficiency in their  processes. Compliance offers reassurance and  provides investors with a more comprehensive  understanding. Please refer to  the Governance  Section in the  latest ESG  Report for    FY 2024-25 Negative: Non-compliance could  damage reputation and, in turn,  impact business operations. 2 Low Carbon  Financing Opportunity The company’s incorporation of environmental,  social, and governance (ESG) factors into its  lending practices presents an opportunity  to promote eco-friendly activities and fund  sustainable projects, thereby encouraging positive  change and supporting long-term growth. Please refer to  the Environment  Section in the  latest ESG  Report for    FY 2024-25 Positive: This enhances the  company’s image, attracts investors,  provides a competitive advantage,  and fosters long-term value creation. 3 Data Security  and Data Privacy Risk The risk of a data breach poses a threat to the  exposure of our customers’ personally identifiable  information, which can harm our business  relationship. Such a breach could compromise the  confidentiality, integrity, and security of sensitive  customer data, potentially eroding trust and  damaging our reputation. Please refer to  the IT Strategy  Section in the  latest ESG  Report for    FY 2024-25 Negative: In the event of a data  breach, the company could face  disruptions to services, financial  losses, reputational damage, and  loss of customer trust. It may also  attract regulatory scrutiny and  potential penalties. 4 Corporate  Governance and  Business Ethics Risk Adhering to business ethics highlights the  company’s commitment to ethical behaviour and  integrity in all interactions. By emphasising ethical  practices, the company seeks to retain current  customers and attract new ones. Upholding these  principles fosters trust, strengthens relationships,  and solidifies the company’s reputation as a  responsible and reliable financial institution. Please refer to  the Corporate  Governance  Section in the  latest ESG  Report for    FY 2024-25 Negative: Unethical behaviour can  harm the company’s reputation  and lead to decreased morale and  productivity, negatively impacting  growth. By upholding ethical  standards and treating customers  and employees with integrity, the  company fosters a positive work  environment and strengthens  stakeholder relationships. 116 117 Future-Focused.

Positive: A strong, engaged, and  diverse workforce brings fresh  perspectives and ideas that drive  innovation, enhance performance,  and foster a positive organisational  culture, showcasing the company’s  commitment to a conducive work  environment. 6 ESG Governance  and Board  Oversight Opportunity Having effective ESG oversight at the board  level will improve overall ESG performance  and demonstrate the company’s dedication  to responsible business practices within its  growth strategy. Embedding ESG into business  operations can enhance risk management,  governance, accountability, and reporting, as  well as inform decision-making. This integration  enables the identification and management of  risks and opportunities related to environmental  and social impacts, while also fostering trust and  transparency with investors and stakeholders. Please refer  to the ESG  Governance  Section in the  latest ESG  Report for    FY 2024-25 Positive: Effective leadership  oversight of the ESG strategy, action  plan, and performance fosters a  positive impact on the environment  and community.

They are entrusted with the responsibility  of operating free from external influences that could compromise their ability to make independent and impartial decisions,  which are critical to fostering the success and growth of the Company.     Additionally, the code explicitly prohibits Directors from exploiting their positions for personal gain, whether directly  or indirectly, at the expense of the Company’s interests. To uphold these standards, both the Board of Directors and  senior management are required to submit an annual declaration, affirming their commitment to abiding by the Code of  Conduct. This declaration also includes a confirmation of their involvement in other companies, ensuring transparency and  accountability in their professional engagements.

(Yes/No)       The Government of India has established the Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order,  2012, aimed at bolstering the marketing efforts for goods and services produced by these enterprises. This initiative  recognises the crucial role that MSEs play in driving economic growth and innovation. In accordance with this policy  framework, Power Finance Corporation (PFC) publishes an annual procurement plan that meticulously outlines the  specific products and services it intends to procure from MSEs. This plan is made available on PFC’s official website,  promoting a culture of transparency and encouraging active participation from MSEs in the public procurement process.  By doing so, PFC not only seeks to enhance the visibility of MSE offerings but also aims to create a more inclusive and  diverse procurement environment.   (b)   From which marginalized /vulnerable groups do you procure?       In accordance with legal requirements, PFC is obligated to ensure that at least 25% of its total procurement is sourced  from Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSEs). This initiative aims to support and promote the growth of these  enterprises within the economy. Of this 25% allocation, a specific focus is placed on inclusivity, mandating that no  less than 4% of all purchases must be made from MSEs that are owned and operated by entrepreneurs belonging  to Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Additionally, the policy emphasises the importance of gender  equity in entrepreneurship by requiring that a minimum of 3% of procurement comes from MSEs that are owned by  women entrepreneurs. These stipulations foster a more diverse and equitable marketplace while contributing to the  development of underrepresented business sectors.   (c)    What percentage of total procurement (by value) does it constitute?       In the FY 2024-25, an impressive 88.57% of all product and service procurements were successfully conducted via  the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal. This significant achievement highlights the platform’s pivotal role in  facilitating government purchases. Notably, a remarkable 42% of the total procurement was sourced from Micro, Small,  and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), demonstrating a strong commitment to supporting these vital contributors to the  economy. Throughout the year, a total of 309 MSEs benefited from these procurement opportunities, including 19  enterprises owned by women, showcasing the empowerment of women entrepreneurs. Additionally, 48 businesses  were owned by individuals from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) category, further emphasising  inclusivity and support for underrepresented groups in the entrepreneurial landscape. 142 143 Future-Focused.

Dear Stakeholders, Over the past four decades, PFC has played a pivotal  role in powering the nation’s growth story. As we  complete 40 years, we recognize that the next chapter  of progress must be shaped not just by financing, but  also by a sense of responsibility -   one that drives  meaningful, inclusive and sustainable change. In recent  years, conversations around sustainability have evolved  from intent to action. At Power Finance Corporation  (PFC), we have embraced this transition with purpose,  making conscious efforts to integrate ESG  considerations into our operations.  It is with great pride that I present the second edition of  our ESG Report for FY 2025, titled “Powering Progress  through Sustainability.” The report has been developed  with the support of  KfW , one of Germany’s leading  development  banks , on behalf of the   G  erman  government .  This  year, we took meaningful steps to  strengthen our ESG foundation. We aligned our ESG  disclosures ‘in reference to’ the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) Universal Standards 2021 and mapped  our material topics to the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (UN SDGs). This is about  strengthening our disclosures in line with global best  practices and promoting transparency and  accountability. At PFC, sustainability is not just a buzzword. It is  embedded in the very grain of how we operate. Our  philosophy, “Funding for a Brighter Tomorrow,” defines  the path we walk every day. Our approach transcends  traditional financing practices, as we consciously  integrate environmental stewardship, social progress,  and robust governance into the core of our corporate  strategy.  We see ourselves not just as a financier of  infrastructure, but as partners in building a more  inclusive and resilient future for the nation. This past year, we made tangible progress on several  fronts. More than 40% of our corporate vehicle fleet is  now electric, helping us avoid around 65  tonnes   of CO ₂   emissions annually -   small steps, but big impact. We also  introduced a comprehensive Equal Opportunity Policy  aligned with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act,  2016, reaffirming our commitment to creating an  inclusive and accessible workplace. Our green lending portfolio continues to be a key  strength. Today, PFC stands as India’s leading financier  of renewable energy, having cumulatively supported  approximately 60 GW  - around 27% of India’s total  renewable energy installed capacity. This year,  disbursements in renewable energy doubled compared  to last year. In FY 2025 alone, we supported additional  10 GW of RE capacity, resulting in estimated annual CO ₂   savings of 255 lakh  tonnes . The recognition we received  at RE - INVEST 2024 was a proud moment, reaffirming  our role in India’s clean energy journey. We also undertook a climate impact assessment of our  top 22 RE projects, which together contribute to  avoiding 5.3 million  tonnes   of CO ₂   emissions annually.  These insights will shape how we screen and evaluate  future projects, ensuring our financing remains aligned  with climate goals in a transparent and measurable way.  During the year, we secured around USD 2.5 billion  green funding from leading international banks and  development financial institutions, including a landmark  JPY 120 billion deal with JBIC, the largest of its kind with  an Indian entity. In essence, we are scaling up not just  capital, but also collaboration. All of this has been made possible by the people who  make up PFC -   our committed teams, visionary Board,  trusted partners, and the communities we serve. As we  look ahead, our focus remains clear -   to accelerate  progress, while keeping sustainability at the center of  everything we do.  The path ahead may be long and complex, but  we are committed to walking it with      responsibility, purpose, and a shared vision      for a cleaner, more resilient future.

Stakeholder engagement is a core pillar of our ESG  strategy and corporate decision - making process. We  believe that a meaningful and an ongoing dialogue with  stakeholders is essential for fostering transparency,  building trust, and ensuring long - term value creation.  Our stakeholder ecosystem includes a diverse range of  groups — ranging from government and regulatory  bodies, investors, lenders, and credit rating agencies, to  customers, employees,  and the communities we serve.  These engagements not only shape our business  priorities but also provide valuable feedback on evolving  expectations around sustainability, governance, and  social responsibility. PFC has institutionalized a structured and responsive  engagement framework, as outlined above, enabling  both formal and informal interaction with key  stakeholder groups.

Powering Progress through Sustainability 20 PFC is well - positioned to lead India's transition towards Net Zero target, leveraging its  extensive domain expertise in the power sector, strong financial capabilities and a proven  track record. By leveraging these strengths, PFC plays a pivotal role in accelerating the  adoption of clean technologies and resilient infrastructure, actively contributing to  environment preservation and climate resilience.  India’s power sector is undergoing a rapid and  transformative shift, driven by strong economic growth,  evolving consumer expectations, and an accelerated  push toward clean energy. Central to this transition are  the India’s  Panchamrit   Goals, announced at COP26,  including the target of expanding non - fossil energy  installed capacity to 500 GW by 2030. Additionally, India  has pledged to reach net - zero emissions by 2070,  signaling its long - term climate ambition. To support  these goals, the Government of India has introduced  several progressive policies to support renewable energy  development — such as the Green Hydrogen Mission,  Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for battery storage and  offshore wind, and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI)  scheme for solar module manufacturing.  At PFC, our commitment to environmental sustainability  is central to our vision and operations. Recognizing the  critical role we play in India’s energy transition, we  actively support initiatives that reduce carbon footprints,  promote renewable energy, and enhance resource  efficiency. Aligned with our ESG vision — "Powering  Progress through Sustainability" — we are deeply  involved in financing India’s clean energy transition,  including climate adaptation and mitigation projects,  energy efficiency initiatives, and e - mobility  advancements. By continuously integrating sustainable  financing solutions into our portfolio, we continue to  play a key role in renewable energy expansion and  climate risk mitigation. Our strategic approach ensures  that environmental considerations are factored into our  decision - making processes, enabling us to lead  responsibly in India's journey towards sustainability. To guide our environmental sustainability efforts, we  have identified two key material topics: ( i ) responsible  natural resource consumption and management and (ii)  low - carbon financing. The following section provides an  overview of our initiatives, and the progress made in  supporting India’s clean energy goals and advancing  environmental stewardship .

As a key enabler of India’s energy transition, PFC  continues to play a pivotal role in financing clean and  sustainable infrastructure. Our commitment to  decarbonization is reflected in our efforts to secure  funding for green financing and strategic international  partnerships that advance low - carbon growth across  the nation. A major milestone in this journey was the execution of a  JPY 120 billion green financing agreement with the Japan  Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)  –   the largest  such agreement signed by JBIC with any Indian  company to date. This landmark deal strengthens cross - border collaboration for climate - aligned investments  and reinforces PFC’s position as a trusted partner in  global climate finance. Further validating our role in  supporting India’s transition, PFC was recognized at RE - INVEST 2024 for its instrumental contribution to the  nation’s achievement of 200 GW of non - fossil fuel  installed capacity — an important step toward its  national target of 500 GW by 2030.

Financing a circular water economy: PFC’s support to STP Infrastructure Introduction:  Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) are a cornerstone of  sustainable urban infrastructure, playing a vital role in  safeguarding India’s water resources and  environmental health. With rapid urbanization, India  now produces over 72,000 million  litres   (MLD) of  sewage daily, while the country’s treatment capacity  stands at only about 31,841 MLD — highlighting a  significant gap in wastewater management.  This imbalance contributes significantly to water  pollution in rivers and groundwater, threatening  ecosystems, public health, and livelihoods.  Strengthening sewage treatment infrastructure is  therefore essential — not only to reduce pollution, but  also to support water recycling and the reuse of  treated water in agriculture, industry, and non - potable  urban applications — thereby promoting a circular  water economy.  Furthermore, STPs support India’s commitment to UN  Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 (Clean Water and  Sanitation) and contribute to broader objectives such  as climate resilience, sustainable urban development,  and improved public health. By financing STPs, PFC is  actively enabling the development of climate - smart,  resilient infrastructure that underpins long - term  environmental and social sustainability. Project Highlights: Project Financing PFC has sanctioned  ₹ 164 crore as  the sole lender for setting up five  STPs with a total capacity of 480.5  MLD across Hyderabad,  Telangana. Technology and Scope The STPs will use Sequential  Batch Reactor (SBR) technology  and include 15 years of operation  and maintenance at various  locations. Environmental Impact  The project will treat sewage  collected from catchment areas  before discharging into the Musi  River, producing recyclable - quality water for industrial and  agricultural use. Project Impact/Outcome: Urban Sewage  Challenge Hyderabad generates  1,650 MLD of sewage,  but with only 772 MLD of  treatment capacity, 878  MLD remains  untreated — much of it  polluting the Musi River. Project Vision &  Environmental Goal The STP initiative aims to  treat sewage with  minimal chemical use  before discharge,  significantly reducing  river pollution and  enhancing water quality. Local Development &  Employment The project is expected  to create jobs and  support social  development by  engaging the local  workforce in  construction, operations,  and maintenance. Public - Private Synergy for Sustainability The initiative encourages industry - government collaboration to reduce pollution and  promote the reuse of treated water for industrial and construction purposes. 184 185 Future-Focused.

Independent Auditors’ Report TO THE MEMBERS OF POWER FINANCE CORPORATION LIMITED REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.   OPINION     We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial  Statements of Power Finance Corporation Limited (‘the  Company’), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at  31 st  March 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including  Other Comprehensive Income), Statement of Changes in  Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then  ended and Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements,  including a summary of Material Accounting Policies and  other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as  “the Standalone Financial Statements”).     In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid  Standalone Financial Statements give the information  required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in  the manner so required and give a true and fair view  in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards  prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,  as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles  generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the  Company as at 31 st  March 2025, and its profit (including  Other Comprehensive Income), changes in equity and its  cash flows for the year ended on that date. 2.   BASIS FOR OPINION     We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards  on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the  Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are  further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for  the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section  of our report. We are independent of the Company in  accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with  the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of  the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions  of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have  fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance  with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements. 3.   KEY AUDIT MATTERS     Key audit matters (“KAM”) are those matters that, in our  professional  judgement,  were  of  most  significance  in  our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the  current year. These matters were addressed in the context  of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a  whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on these matters.      We have determined the matters described below to be  the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. For  each matter below, description of how our audit addressed the  matter is provided in that context: Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter Auditors’ Response (i) Impairment of financial instruments - Loan Assets and  Undisbursed letter of comfort In this regard, the Company follows a Board approved  methodology wherein assessment for allowance is carried out by  an External Agency for Impairment based on certain guidelines  and procedures in respect of criterion/framework classifying the  assets into various stages depending upon credit risk and level of  evidence of Impairment.  Impairment loss measurement requires use of statistical models  to estimate the Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default  (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These models are key driver  to measure Impairment loss. The key indicators underlying for assessment of impairment  allowance are appraised on the ongoing basis by the management.  The most significant areas where we identified greater levels of  management Judgments are: Our audit procedures included: •     The Company has availed services of an External Agency for  assessment of ECL, whose report has been provided to us. We verified  the criterion / framework with applicable regulatory requirements  along with Company’s internal guidelines and procedures in respect  of the impairment allowance. •     Verified  loan  assets  by  applying  the  standard  audit  procedures  with respect to the credit appraisal, sanctioning, documentation,  review and monitoring process of the Company. Also, loan balances  were verified basis external confirmation from the borrowers and  assessed quality of the borrower based on recovery and other  criteria as per the credit policy of the Company. •     Reviewed the underlying assumptions and broad methodology of  ECL assessment. 4.     INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE  STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND  AUDITOR’S REPORT THEREON     The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for  the preparation of the other information. The other  information comprises the information included in the  Director’s Report including Annexures to Director’s  Report, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business  Responsibility Report and Sustainability Report and  Report on Corporate Governance (collectively referred  to as “other information”) but does not include the  Standalone Financial Statements and our auditors’ report  thereon. The above-referred information is expected to be  made available to us after the date of this Auditor’s report.     Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does  not cover the other information and we do not express  any form of assurance conclusion thereon.     In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information identified above when it became available  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information  is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial  Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course  of audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.      If, based on the work we have performed, we concluded  that there is a material misstatement of this other  information, we are required to report that fact, we have  nothing to report in this regard. 5.     RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND  THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR  THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for  the  matters  stated  in  Section  134(5)  of  the  Act  with  respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial  Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter Auditors’ Response Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) – Company has classified  SICR  based  on  the  indicator  defined  in  Ind  AS,  estimate  the  Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and  Individually assessed Stage 3 carrying value. The carrying value  of loans and advances to borrowers may be materially misstated  if individual impairments are not appropriately estimated based  upon certain assumptions, future cash flow and asset valuations. Considering  the  effect  of  these  matters,  as  part  of  our  risk  assessment, we determined that the value of Expected Credit Loss  (ECL) has a high degree of estimation & uncertainty. In view of the  significance of the amount of loan assets out of total assets in  the  Standalone Financial Statements, impairments of loan assets have  been considered as key audit matter in our audit. [Refer Note No. 40.1.2 and 40.1.3 to the Standalone Financial  Statements read with Note No. 5.3.1 (iii) and Note.6.2 (ii)] •     Components and calculations in the study for impairment allowance  carried out by the independent expert have been test checked,  discussed with the management and relied upon by us. Also, our  audit procedure in this regard is limited since certain parameters  of study being considered confidential have not been shared by the  aforesaid expert. We considered the credit impairment charge and provision recognised  and the related disclosures to be acceptable & satisfactory. (ii) Fair Valuation of Derivative financial instruments  The Company enters into derivative contracts in accordance with  RBI guidelines to mitigate its currency and interest rate risk in  accordance with currency risk management policy approved by  the Board of Directors of the Company. Derivative contracts are either categorised at Fair Value through  P&L (FVTPL) or under cash flow hedge (Hedge Accounting). Mark to  market gain/loss on derivatives categorised at FVTPL is recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss and that of Hedge Accounting is  recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income.  We consider the valuation of the derivative financial instruments  and hedge accounting as a key audit matter due to material  exposure and the fact that the inappropriate application of these  requirements /assumptions / estimate by contracting bank could  lead to a material effect on the income statement. [Refer Note No. 41 and 40.4 to the Standalone Financial Statements  read with Note No. 5.3.3] Our audit procedures included:  The Company has availed services of an independent expert for  preparation of a model for derivative accounting as per Ind AS 109.  Discussed with management to have an understanding of its perception  and also reviewed policy of the Company for risk management.  Evaluated  key  internal  controls  over  classification  of  derivative  instruments.  The Company obtains fair value of derivative from the counterparty  banks as on the reporting date, which are relied upon by us. Our  procedure included evaluation of details of various financial derivative  contracts outstanding as on 31 st  March, 2025 and fair value thereof. Additionally, we verified the accounting of gain or loss on mark to market  basis of derivative contracts in Statement of Profit & Loss and Other  Comprehensive Income in case of derivatives contracts under cash flow  hedge. Based on the aforesaid procedure, we have reviewed accounting of  derivatives in the books of account and assessed that the related  disclosures are given in the financial statements. 244 245 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial  position, financial performance (including comprehensive  income), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company  in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting  principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility  also includes maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; making judgements and estimates that are  reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that  were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the  preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial  Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.      In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the Board  of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s  ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless management either  intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or  has no realistic alternative but to do so.      The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing  the Company’s financial reporting process.  6.    AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE  AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS     Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes  our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected  to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.      As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:    •     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control.    •     Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section  143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also  responsible for expressing our opinion on whether  the Company has adequate internal financial controls  system in place and the operating effectiveness of  such controls.      •     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management.    •     Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s  use of the going concern basis of accounting and,  based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report to the related disclosures in the Standalone  Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Company to cease to  continue as a going concern.    •     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the Standalone Financial Statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  Standalone Financial Statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation.      Materiality is the magnitude of misstatement in the  Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in  aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions  of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Financial  Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative  materiality and qualitative factors in (i) Planning the  scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of  our work: and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified  misstatements in the Financial Statements.     We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we  identify during our audit.      We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.      From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of  most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements  of the current year and are therefore, the key audit  matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report  unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about  the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication. 7.   OTHER MATTERS     The comparative data for the year ended 31 st  March, 2024  included in the Standalone Financial Statements have been  audited by the other joint statutory auditors; whose audit  report dated 15 th  May, 2024 expressed unmodified opinion  on the comparative Standalone Financial Statements. Our  opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 8.     REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS   I.

Annexure C to the Independent Auditors’ Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements (Referred to in Para 8 III(f) under the heading ‘Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ of our report of even date to  The Members of Power Finance Corporation Limited on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025) Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to  Standalone  Financial  Statements  under  Clause  (i)  of  Sub- Section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls with reference  to the Standalone Financial Statements of Power Finance  Corporation Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 st  March, 2025  in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 1.     MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR  INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS     The Company’s management is responsible for  establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based  on  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include  the design implementation and maintenance of adequate  internal financial controls that were operating effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly  and  efficient  conduct  of  its  business including adherence to Company’s policies the  safeguarding of its assets the prevention and detection of  frauds and errors the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records and the timely preparation of reliable  financial information as required under the Act. 2.   AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY     Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s internal financial controls with reference to  Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial  Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on  Auditing, issued by ICAI prescribed under Sub-section  10 of Section 143 of the Act, to the extent applicable to  an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards  and the Guidance Note require that we comply with  ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal financial controls over financial reporting were  established and maintained and if such controls operated  effectively in all material respects.     Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the internal financial controls system over  financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our  audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that  a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud  or error.     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  financial  controls  system over financial reporting. 3.     MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL  CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING     A  Company’s  internal  financial  control  over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal  financial control over financial reporting includes those  policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance  that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are  being made only in accordance with authorisations of the  Management of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the  Standalone Financial Statements. 4.    INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL  FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL  REPORTING     Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur  and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting  to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial  control  over  financial  reporting  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. 5.   OPINION     In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an internal financial controls system over financial reporting  and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 st  March, 2025, based on  the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

The Company being a Government owned NBFC-IFC is  placed in Middle layer under Master Direction (NBFC-Scale  Based Regulation), 2023 issued by RBI.     Equity shares of the Company are listed on National Stock  Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited. Further,  various debt securities of the Company are also listed on  the stock exchanges. 2.   STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE     The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company  comply  with  Ind  AS  notified  under  the  Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended),  applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and other  applicable regulatory norms / guidelines. The Standalone  Balance Sheet, Statement of Profit and Loss and Statement  of Changes in Equity are prepared and presented as  per the requirements of Division III of Schedule III to  the Companies Act, 2013 applicable for Non-Banking  Financial Companies (NBFCs). The Standalone Statement  of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented as per  the requirements of Ind AS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 3.     These Standalone Financial Statements have been  approved for issue by Board of Directors (BoD) of the  Company on 21.05.2025. 4     STANDARDS / AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT  NOT YET EFFECTIVE     During the FY 2024-25, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs  (MCA)  has  not  notified  any  new  Indian  Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) or made amendments thereto, which  are not yet effective. 5     MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY  INFORMATION     The material accounting policy information in regard to  preparation of the Standalone Financial Statements is  given below: 5.1   Basis of Preparation and Measurement     These Standalone Financial Statements have been  prepared on going concern basis following accrual  system of accounting. The assets and liabilities have been  measured at historical cost or at amortised cost or at fair  value as applicable at the end of each reporting period. The  functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupees ( H ).     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date,  regardless of whether that price is directly observable or  estimated using another valuation technique.     Fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1,  2 or 3 as per Ind AS requirement, which are described  as follows:   •     Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in  active markets for identical assets or liabilities that  the entity can access at the measurement date;   •     Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices  included within Level 1, that are observable for the  asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and   •     Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset  or liability. 5.2   Cash and Cash Equivalents     Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. The  Company considers cash equivalents as all short-term  balances (with an original maturity of three months or less  from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments  that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash  and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  in value. 5.3   Financial Instruments     Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  when the Company becomes a party to the contractual  provisions of the financial instruments.     On  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities are recognised at fair value plus / minus  transaction cost that is attributable to the acquisition  or  issue  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities.  In  case of financial assets and financial liabilities which are  recognised at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL),  its transaction costs are recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss. 5.3.1 Financial Assets     All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are  recognised and derecognised on a settlement date basis.  Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales  of financial assets that require delivery of assets within  the time frame established by regulation or convention in  the marketplace.     After initial recognition, financial assets are subsequently  measured in their entirety at either amortised cost  or  fair  value,  depending  on  the  classification  of  the  financial assets.   (i)     Classification  and  Measurement  of  Financial  Assets  (other  than  Equity  instruments)   (a)   Financial Assets at Amortised Cost:       Financial assets that meet the following conditions  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  Effective Interest Rate method (EIR):     •     the asset is held within a business model whose  objective is to hold assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows; and     •     The contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are Solely  Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the  principal amount outstanding.     Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method       The effective interest rate method is a method of  calculating the amortised cost of financial asset and  of allocating interest income over the expected life.  The company while applying EIR method, generally  amortises any fee, transaction costs and other  premiums or discount that are integral part of the  effective interest rate of a financial instrument.       Income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss on an effective interest rate basis for financial  assets other than those classified as at FVTPL.       EIR is determined at the initial recognition of the  financial  asset.  EIR  is  subsequently  updated  at  every reset, in accordance with the terms of the  respective contract.       Once the terms of financial assets are renegotiated,  other than market driven interest rate movement,  any gain / loss measured using the previous EIR as  calculated before the modification, is recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss in period during  which such renegotiations occur.   (b)     Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Other  Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)       A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if both the  following conditions are met:     •     The objective of the business model is achieved  both by collecting contractual cash flows and  selling the financial asset; and     •     The contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are Solely  Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the  principal amount outstanding.       All fair value changes are recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated  in Reserve.   (c)     Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss  (FVTPL)       A financial asset is measured at FVTPL unless it is  measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI, with all  changes in fair value recognised in Statement of  Profit and Loss.     Business Model       An assessment of business model for managing  financial assets is fundamental to the classification  of  a  financial  asset.  The  Company  determines  the  business  model  at  a  level  that  reflects  how  financial  assets  are  managed  together  to  achieve  a particular business objective of generating cash  flows. The Company’s business model assessment  is performed at a higher level of aggregation  rather than on an instrument-by-instrument basis.   The Company is in the business of providing loans  across power, logisitics & infrastructure sector and  such loans are managed to realise the contractual  cash flows over the tenure of the loan. Further, other  financial assets may also be held by the Company to  collect the contractual cash flows.   (ii)     Classification,  Measurement  and  Derecognition of Equity Instruments       All equity investments other than in subsidiaries,  joint ventures and associates are measured at  fair value. Equity instruments which are held for  trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity  instruments, the Company at initial recognition  makes an irrevocable election to classify it as  either FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such  election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.   An  equity  investment  classified  as  FVTOCI  is  initially measured at fair value plus transaction  costs. Subsequently, it is measured at fair value  and, all fair value changes are recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated  in Reserve. There is no recycling of the amounts  from  OCI  to  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss,  even  on sale of investment. However, the Company  transfers the cumulative gain / loss within equity.   Equity instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. “ 264 265 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Investment in equity shares of subsidiaries, joint  ventures and associates are accounted at cost, less  impairment if any.   (iii)   Impairment of Financial Assets       Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company  recognises  expected  credit  loss  (ECL)  on  financial  assets measured at amortised cost as required  under Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’. The  Company presents the ECL charge or reversal  (where the net amount is a negative balance for a  particular  period)  in  the  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  as  “Impairment  on  financial  instruments”  and  as a cumulative deduction from gross carrying  amount in the Balance Sheet, wherever applicable.   The impairment requirements for the recognition and  measurement of ECL are equally applied to financial  asset measured at FVTOCI except that ECL is recognised  in Other Comprehensive Income and is not reduced  from the carrying amount in the Balance Sheet.   (a)     Impairment of Loan Assets and commitments under  Letter of Comfort (LoC) & Letter of Undertaking (LoU):       The Company measures ECL on loan assets at an  amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is credit  impairment or there has been significant increase in  credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. If there is no  SICR as compared to initial recognition, the Company  measures ECL at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.  When making the assessment of whether there has  been a SICR since initial recognition, the Company  considers reasonable and supportable information,  that is available without undue cost or effort. If the  Company measured loss allowance as lifetime ECL in  the previous period, but determines in a subsequent  period that there has been no SICR since initial  recognition due to improvement in credit quality, the  Company again measures the loss allowance based  on 12-month ECL.       ECL is measured on individual basis for credit  impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets  it is generally measured on collective basis using  homogenous groups.       The Company measures impairment on  commitments under LoC & LoU on similar basis as in  case of Loan assets.   (b)     Impairment  of  financial  assets,  other  than  loan assets:       ECL  on  financial  assets,  other  than  loan  assets,  is measured at an amount equal to life time  expected losses.   (iv)   De-recognition of Financial Assets       The Company derecognises a financial asset when  the contractual rights to the cash flows from the  asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset  along with all the substantial risks and rewards  of ownership of the asset to another party. The  renegotiation  or  modification  of  the  contractual  cash  flows  of  a  financial  asset  can  also  lead  to  derecognition of the existing financial asset.       On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety,  the difference between the asset’s carrying amount  and the sum of the consideration received &  receivable, and the cumulative gain or loss that  had been recognised in Other Comprehensive  Income and accumulated in Equity, is recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss if such gain or loss  would have otherwise been recognised in Statement  of Profit and Loss on disposal of that financial asset. 5.3.2 Financial Liabilities   (i)     All  financial  liabilities  other  than  derivatives  and  financial  guarantee  contracts  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest rate (EIR) method.       EIR is determined at the initial recognition of the  financial  liability.  EIR  is  subsequently  updated  for  financial liabilities having floating interest rate, at the  respective reset date, in accordance with the terms  of the respective contract.   (ii)   Financial guarantee       A  financial  guarantee  issued  by  the  Company  is  initially measured at fair value and, if not designated  as at FVTPL, is subsequently measured at the  higher of:     •     the best estimate of expenditure required to  settle any financial obligation arising as a result  of the guarantee; and     •     the amount initially recognised less, when  appropriate, the cumulative amount of income  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   (iii)   De-recognition of financial liabilities       The Company derecognises financial liabilities when,  and only when, the Company’s obligations are  discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference  between the carrying amount of the financial liability  derecognised and the consideration paid & payable  is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. 5.3.3 Derivative Financial Instruments   (i)     The Company enters into a variety of derivative  financial  instruments  to  manage  its  exposure  to  interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks.   (ii)     Under hedge accounting, an entity can designate  derivative  contracts  either  as  cash  flow  hedge  or  fair value hedge. The Company designates certain  derivative  contracts  as  cash  flow  hedge  or  fair  value hedge.   (iii)     To qualify for hedge accounting, the  hedging relationship must meet all of the  following requirements:     •     There is an economic relationship between the  hedged item and the hedging instrument.     •     The  effect  of  credit  risk  does  not  dominate  the value changes that result from that  economic relationship.     •     The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is  the same as that resulting from the quantity  of the hedged item that the Company actually  hedges and the quantity of the hedging  instrument that the Company actually uses to  hedge that quantity of hedged item.   (iv)   Cash flow hedge       The hedging instruments which meets the qualifying  criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash  flow hedge. The effective portion of changes in the  fair value of derivatives that are designated and  qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income. The change in intrinsic value  of  hedging  instruments  is  recognised  in  ‘Effective  Portion of Cash Flow Hedges’. The amounts recognised  in such reserve are reclassified to the Statement of  Profit or Loss when the hedged item affects profit  or loss. Further, the change in fair value of the time  value of a hedging instruments is recognised in ‘Cost  of Hedging Reserve’. The amounts recognised in such  reserve are amortised to the Statement of Profit and  Loss on a systematic basis. The gain or loss relating  to ineffective portion is recognised immediately in  Statement of Profit and Loss.   (v)   Fair Value hedge       The Company remeasures the hedged item for fair  value changes attributable to the hedged risk (i.e.  changes in the benchmark rate). Such fair value  hedge adjustment are recognised in the statement  of profit or loss at end of every reporting period. The  change in fair value of the underlying hedged item  on account of attributable hedged risk (benchmark  rate) is offset by corresponding change in fair value  of the derivative (Fixed to Float IRS).   (vi)     Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires, or terminated, or exercised, or  when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.   (vii)     Derivatives, other than those designated under hedge  relationship, are initially recognised at fair value at the  date the derivative contracts are entered into and are  subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the  end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or  loss is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. 5.4    Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial  Liabilities     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and  the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when  currently there is a legally enforceable right to offset the  recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle  on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the  liabilities simultaneously. 5.5    Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  (PPE)  and  Depreciation   (i)     Items of PPE are initially recognised at cost.  Subsequent measurement is done at cost less  accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any, except for freehold land  which is not depreciated. An item of PPE retired from  active use and held for disposal is stated at lower of  its book value or net realisable value.   (ii)     In case of assets put to use, capitalisation is done  on the basis of bills approved or estimated value of  work done as per contracts where final bill(s) is/are  yet to be received / approved, subject to necessary  adjustment in the year of final settlement.   (iii)     Cost of replacing part of an item of PPE is recognised  in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable  that the future economic benefits embodied within  the part will flow to the Company and its cost can  be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the  replaced part is derecognised. Maintenance or  servicing costs of PPE are recognised in Statement of  Profit and Loss as incurred.   (iv)     Under-construction PPE is carried at cost, less any  recognised impairment loss. Such PPE items are  classified to the appropriate categories of property,  plant and equipment when completed and ready for  intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the  same basis as of other assets, commences when the  assets are ready for their intended use. 266 267 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   (v)     Depreciation  is  recognised  so  as  to  write-off  the  cost of assets less their residual values as per  written down value method, over the useful lives as  prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013,  except for cell phones where useful life has been  estimated by the Company as 2 years. Residual value  is estimated as 5% of the original cost of PPE.   (vi)     Depreciation on additions to/deductions from PPE  during the year is charged on pro-rata basis from /  up to the date on which the asset is available for use/ disposed.   (vii)     An item of PPE is derecognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected to  arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain  or loss arising on the de-recognition of an item of  PPE is determined as the difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the  asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.   (viii)    Items of PPE costing up to  H   5000/- each are fully  depreciated, in the year of purchase. 5.6   Intangible Assets and Amortisation   (i)     Intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  that  are acquired separately are recognised at cost.  Cost includes any directly attributable incidental  expenses necessary to make the assets ready for  its intended use. Subsequent measurement is  done at cost less accumulated amortisation and  accumulated impairment losses, if any. Amortisation  is recognised on a straight-line basis over their  estimated useful lives.   (ii)    Expenditure incurred which are eligible for  capitalisation under intangible assets is carried as  Intangible Assets under Development till they are  ready for their intended use.   (iii)     Estimated useful life of intangible assets with finite  useful lives has been estimated by the Company as  5 years.   (iv)     An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are  expected  from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from de- recognition of an intangible asset, measured as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds and  the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset  is derecognised. 5.7   Leases     For recognition, measurement and presentation of lease  contracts, the Company applies the principles of Ind AS  116 ‘Leases’.   (i)   The Company as a lessee       The Company at inception of a contract assesses,  whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A  contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys  the right to control the use of an identified asset  for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  To assess whether a contract conveys the right to  control the use of an identified asset, the Company  assesses whether    (a)     the Company has substantially all of the economic  benefits from use of the asset through the period of  the lease, and   (b)     the Company has the right to direct the use of the  identified asset.      The Company at inception of a lease contract recognises  a Right-of-Use (RoU) asset at cost and a corresponding  lease liability, except for leases with term of less than  twelve months (short-term) and low-value assets which  are recognised as an operating expense on a straight-line  basis over the term of the lease.      Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend  or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term.  RoU assets and lease liabilities includes these options  when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.     The right-of-use (RoU) assets are initially recognised  at cost, which comprise the initial amount of the lease  liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before  the inception date of the lease plus any initial direct costs,  less any lease incentives received. They are subsequently  measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and  accumulated impairment losses. The right-of-use asset  is depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term or  useful life of right-of-use assets.      The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost  at the present value of future lease payments. The lease  payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit  in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the  Company’s incremental borrowing rates in the country of  domicile of the leases.      Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding  adjustment to the related right-of-use (RoU) asset if  the Company changes its assessment if whether it will  exercise an extension or a termination option.      Lease liability and RoU asset is separately presented in  the Balance Sheet. Interest expense on lease liability is  presented separately from depreciation on right of use  asset as a component of finance cost in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. Lease payments for the principal portion  are classified as Cash flow used in financing activities and  lease payments for the interest portion are classified as  Cash flow used in operating activities.    (ii)   The Company as a lessor       Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified  as a finance or operating lease. Contracts in which all  the risks and rewards of the lease are substantially  transferred to the lessee are classified as a finance  lease.  All  other  leases  are  classified  as  operating  leases. For operating leases, rental income is  recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of  the relevant lease.       Amount  due  from  lessee  under  finance  leases  is  recognised as receivable at an amount equal to the  net investment of the Company in the lease. Finance  income on the lease is allocated to accounting  periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of  return on the Company’s net investment outstanding  in respect of lease at the reporting date. 5.8    Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities  and  Contingent Assets   (i)     Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present legal or constructive obligation as a result  of a past event, if it is probable that the Company  will be required to settle the obligation and a  reliable estimate can be made of the amount of  the obligation.   (ii)     The amount recognised as a provision is the best  estimate of the consideration required to settle the  present obligation at the end of the reporting period,  taking into account the risks and uncertainties  surrounding the obligation.   (iii)     When some or all of the economic benefits required  to settle a provision are expected to be recovered  from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an  asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will  be received and the amount of the receivable can be  measured reliably.   (iv)     Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required or the amount cannot be  estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as  contingent liability in notes to accounts, unless  the  probability  of  outflow  of  economic  benefits  is remote.   (v)     Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial  statements. However, contingent assets are  disclosed in the financial statements when inflow of  economic benefits is probable. 5.9   Recognition of Income and Expenditure   (i)     Interest  income,  on  financial  assets  subsequently  measured at amortised cost, is recognised using the  Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. The Effective  Interest Rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts  estimated future cash receipts through expected  life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying  amount on initial recognition.   (ii)     Interest on financial assets subsequently measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  and  loss  (FVTPL),  is  recognised on accrual basis in accordance with  the terms of the respective contract and disclosed  separately under the head ‘Interest Income’   (iii)     Rebate on account of timely payment of dues by  borrowers is recognised on receipt of entire dues in  time, in accordance with the terms of the respective  contract and is netted against the corresponding  interest income.   (iv)     Income from services rendered is recognised based  on the terms of agreements / arrangements with  reference to the stage of completion of contract at  the reporting date.   (v)     Dividend income from investments including those  measured at FVTPL, is recognised in Statement of  Profit and Loss under the head ‘Dividend Income’  when the Company’s right to receive dividend is  established and the amount of dividend can be  measured reliably.   (vi)     Interest expense on financial liabilities subsequently  measured at amortised cost is recognised using  Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.   (vii)    Other income and expenses are accounted on  accrual basis, in accordance with terms of the  respective contract.   (viii)     A Prepaid expense up to  H   1,00,000/- is recognised as  expense upon initial recognition in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. 5.10    Foreign  Currency  Transactions  and  Translations     Foreign currency transactions are translated into the  functional currency using exchange rates at the date of  the transaction.  268 269 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     At the end of each reporting period, monetary items  denominated in foreign currency are translated using  exchange rates prevailing on the last day of the reporting  period.  Exchange  differences  on  monetary  items  are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period  in which they arise. However, for the long-term monetary  items recognised in the financial statements before April  01, 2018, such exchange differences are accumulated in a  “Foreign Currency Monetary Item Translation Difference  Account” and amortised over the balance period of such  long term monetary item.” 5.11   Employee Benefits   (i)   Defined Contribution Plan       Company’s contribution paid / payable during the  reporting period towards pension is charged in the  Statement of Profit and Loss when employees have  rendered service entitling them to the contributions.   (ii)   Defined Benefit Plan       The Company’s obligation towards provident fund,  gratuity to employees and post-retirement benefits  such  as  medical  benefit,  economic  rehabilitation  benefit, and settlement allowance after retirement  are determined using the projected unit credit  method, with actuarial valuations being carried out  at the end of each annual reporting period. Actuarial  gain / loss on re-measurement of gratuity and  other post-employment defined benefit plans are  recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).  Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment.   (iii)   Other long-term employee benefits       The Company’s obligation towards leave  encashment, service award scheme is determined  using the projected unit credit method, with  actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of  each annual reporting period. These obligations are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   (iv)   Short term employee benefits       Short term employee benefits such as salaries and  wages are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss, in the period in which the related service is  rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits  expected to be paid in exchange for that service.   (v)   Loan to employees at concessional rate       Loans given to employees at concessional rate are  initially recognised at fair value and subsequently  measured at amortised cost. The difference between  the initial fair value of such loans and transaction  value is recognised as deferred employee cost upon  issuance of Loan, which is amortised on a straight- line basis over the expected remaining period of the  loan. In case of change in expected remaining period  of the loan, the unamortised deferred employee  cost on the date of change is amortised over the  updated expected remaining period of the Loan on  a prospective basis. 5.12   Material Prior Period Errors     Material prior period errors are corrected retrospectively  by restating the comparative amounts for the prior  periods presented in which the error occurred. If the  error occurred before the earliest period presented, the  opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the  earliest period presented, are restated. 5.13   Income Taxes     Income Tax expense comprises of current and deferred  tax. It is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except  when it relates to an item that is recognised in OCI or  directly in equity, in which case, tax is also recognised in  OCI or directly in equity.   (i)   Current Tax       Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable  income for the year, using tax rates enacted or  substantively enacted and as applicable at the  reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable  in respect of earlier years.        Current  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  when  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off  the  recognised amounts and there is an intention to  settle the asset and liability on a net basis.   (ii)   Deferred Tax       Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences  between the carrying amounts of assets and  liabilities  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  corresponding tax bases used in the computation of  taxable income. Deferred tax is measured at the tax  rates based on the laws that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the reporting date, based  on the expected manner of realisation or settlement  of the carrying amount of assets / liabilities. Deferred  tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a  legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets  against liabilities, and they relate to income taxes  levied by the same tax authority.       A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable  temporary  differences.  A  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognised for all deductible temporary differences  to the extent that it is probable that future taxable  profits will be available against which the deductible  temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax  assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are  reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable  that the related tax benefit will be realised. 5.14   Earnings Per Share     Basic earnings per equity share is calculated by dividing  the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders  of the Company by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the financial year.      To calculate diluted earnings per share, the net profit or  loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders  and the weighted average number of shares outstanding  during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive  potential equity shares. 5.15   Expenditure on issue of shares     Expenditure on issue of shares is charged to the securities  premium account. 5.16   Dividends     Final dividends are recorded as a liability on the date of  approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are  recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the  Board of Directors of the Company. 5.17     Business Combination under Common  Control     A business combination involving entities or businesses  under common control is a business combination in which  all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately  controlled by the same party or parties both before  and after the business combination and that control is  not transitory.     Business combinations involving entities or businesses  under common control are accounted for using the  pooling of interest method as follows:   •     The assets and liabilities of the combining entities  are reflected at their carrying amounts.   •     No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or  recognise new assets or liabilities. Adjustments  are made only to harmonise material accounting  policy information.   •     The financial information in the financial statements  in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business  combination has occurred from the beginning of  the  preceding  period  in  the  financial  statements,  irrespective of the actual date of the combination.     The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the  financial statements of the transferor is aggregated with  the  corresponding  balance  appearing  in  the  financial  statements of the transferee. The identity of the reserves  is preserved and the reserves of the transferor become  the reserves of the transferee.     The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as  share capital issued plus any additional consideration in  the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share  capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve  and is presented separately from other capital reserves. 6.    USE OF ESTIMATES AND MANAGEMENT  JUDGEMENT     In preparation of the Standalone Financial Statements, the  Management is required to make judgements, estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related  disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions  are based on historical experience & other relevant factors  and are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual results may  differ from these estimates.      Changes in accounting estimates, if any, are recognised  prospectively in the period in which the estimate is revised  if the revision affects only that period or in the period of  the revision & future periods if it affects both current &  future periods. 6.1   Significant Management Judgements     In order to enhance understanding of the Standalone  Financial  Statements,  information  about  significant  areas of critical judgements, apart from those involving  estimation (Note 6.2), in applying accounting policies  that  have  the  most  significant  effect  on  the  amounts  recognised in the Standalone Financial Statements, are  as under:   (i)   Deferred tax Liability on Special Reserve       The Company had passed a Board resolution  that it has no intention to withdraw any amount  from the Special Reserve created and maintained  under Section 36(1)(viii) of the Income Tax Act,  1961. Accordingly, the Special Reserve created and  maintained cannot be withdrawn and as there is no  future tax incidence, the Company does not create  deferred tax liability on the said reserve. 270 271 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   (ii)     Non recognition of income on Credit Impaired  loan assets       As a matter of prudence, income on credit impaired  loan assets is recognised as and when received or  on accrual basis when expected realisation is higher  than the loan amount outstanding.   (iii)     Amortisation of transaction cost on credit impaired  loan assets       Outstanding amount of unamortised transaction  cost is credited to Statement of Profit and Loss on  classification of loan asset as credit impaired.   (iv)   Classification of Investments       In order to classify an investment in a company as  investment in subsidiary or joint venture (JV) or  associate, judgement is required to assess the level of  control depending upon the facts and circumstances  of each case.   (a)     The Company along with its subsidiary RECL is  holding  21.49  %  stake  in  equity  share  capital  of  Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL). However,  in the absence of any practical ability to direct the  relevant activities as per the requirements of Ind AS  28’Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures’, the  Company does not have any significant influence,  accordingly EESL has not been considered as an  associate company.   (b)     Ultra-Mega Power Projects (UMPPs) are managed  as per the mandate from Government of India (GoI)  and the Company does not have the practical ability  to direct the relevant activities of these UMPPs  unilaterally. The Company therefore, considers its  investment in respective UMPPs as associates having  significant influence despite the Company holding  100% of their paid-up equity share capital.   (c)     By virtue of holding Board position or equity stake  in borrower companies, the rights exercised by PFC  in such companies are protective in nature. Thus,  the borrower companies are not considered as  Associates for the purpose of financial statements.   (v)   Low value leases       An assessment is required, if lessee opts not to apply  the recognition and measurement requirements of  Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ to leases where the underlying  asset is of low value. For the purpose of determining  low value, the Company has considered nature of  assets and concept of materiality as defined in Ind  AS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and  the conceptual framework of Ind AS which involve  significant judgement.   (vi)   Sundry Liabilities - Interest Capitalisation       Unrealised income on credit impaired loans,  represented by Funded Interest Term Loan (FITL) /  debt / equity instruments acquired under resolution,  is transferred to a separate account titled ‘Sundry  Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalisation)’ and  is  recognised  in  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  on  repayment of FITL or sale / redemption of debt /  equity instruments.   (vii)     Evaluation of indicators for impairment loss  allowance of financial assets       The evaluation of the applicability of indicators for  computation of impairment loss allowance of assets  requires assessment of several external and internal  factors which could result in change in recoverable  amount of the assets. The Company makes  significant judgement in identifying the default and  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  (SICR)  based  on  available information. 6.2    Assumptions and Key Sources of Estimation  Uncertainty     Information about estimates and assumptions that have  the significant effect on recognition and measurement of  assets, liabilities, income and expenses is provided below:   (i)   Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)       The Company’s estimate of the DBO is based on a  number of underlying assumptions such as standard  rates  of  inflation,  mortality,  discount  rate  and  anticipation of future salary increases. Variation in  these assumptions may significantly impact the DBO  amount and the annual defined benefit expenses as  detailed at Note 44.2.   (ii)     Impairment test of Financial Assets (Expected Credit  Loss)       The measurement of impairment loss allowance  for  financial  assets  which  includes  loan,  LoCs,  LoUs and guarantees measured at amortised cost  requires use of statistical models, expected future  economic  conditions,  estimated  cash  flows  and  credit behaviour (e.g., inputs and weights used for  credit risk scoring, likelihood of borrowers defaulting  and resulting losses). The cash flows expected to be  recovered from credit impaired loans are assessed  based on the borrower’s financial situation, current  status of the project, bid-value, resolution plan  amount, OTS amount as available.        As these estimates are based on various  assumptions, actual results may vary. Refer Note  40.1 for further details.   (iii)   Fair value measurement       Fair  value  of  financial  instruments  is  required  to  be estimated for financial reporting purposes. The  Company applies appropriate valuation techniques  and inputs for fair value measurements. In estimating  the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company  uses quoted prices and market-observable data to  the extent it is available. In case of non-availability  of the same, unobservable inputs are used for  calculation of fair value of the assets / liabilities. The  information about the valuation techniques, inputs  used in determination of fair value of various assets  & liabilities and other details are disclosed at Note 42.   (iv)   Income Taxes       Estimates are involved in determining the provision  for income taxes, including amount expected to be  paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions and also  in respect of expected future profitability to assess  deferred tax asset. Refer Note 37 for details.   (v)     Useful life of Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) and  Intangible Assets       The Company reviews its estimate of the useful  lives of depreciable / amortisable assets at the end  of each financial year, based on the expected utility  of the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates  relate to technical and economic obsolescence that  may change the utility of assets. Refer Note 15 for  details on useful lives and carrying values of PPE and  Intangible assets. 272 273 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

The claims of the holders of  the PDI are:  (a)     Superior to the claims of the holders of the equity shares issued by the Company and perpetual non-cumulative preference  shares, if any, of the Company; and (b)     Subordinated to the claims of all other creditors of the Company (but pari-passu inter se the holders of the PDIs).

As these securities are perpetual in nature and claim of PDI holders is subordinate to claim of all other  creditors and further as the Company does not have an unconditional right not to pay the coupon, these have been  classified under subordinated liabilities. 19.2 Details of Subordinated Debt (Unsecured) are as under: Sr. No. Subordinated Bond Series Coupon  Rate (p.a.)

The Company carries an impairment loss allowance of  H   72.95 crore on its investments as at  31.03.2025 (as at 31.03.2024  H   72.95 crore). (b)     Credit risk on other financial assets and trade receivables is evaluated based on Company’s knowledge of the credit worthiness of those parties and  managed by monitoring the recoverability of such amounts. The Company carries an impairment loss allowance of  H   29.90 crore on its other financial  assets and trade receivables as at 31.03.2025 (as at 31.03.2024  H   22.27 crore). (c)   The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through its lending operations. The same is explained in the paragraphs below. 40.1.1 Credit Risk Management for Lending Operations     The Company has put in place key policies and processes for managing credit risk, which include formulating credit policies,  guiding the Company’s appetite for credit risk exposures, undertaking reviews & objective assessment of credit risk,  and monitoring performance and management of portfolios. All the procedures and processes of the Company are ISO  9001:2015 certified.     The credit risk management covers two key areas, i.e., project appraisal & project monitoring. The Company selects the  borrowers in accordance with the Company’s approved credit policy, which inter alia, defines factors to be considered for  rating of the borrower / project. The Company’s customer selection procedure assesses viability of project along with that of  its promoting entity. Rate of interest and maximum admissible exposure is, inter alia, based on internal rating awarded by  the Company.   (i)   Appraisal of Projects       The Company follows a systematic, institutional project appraisal process to assess the credit risk before financing  any project.    (a)   Appraisal for Private Sector Projects         For private sector projects, a two-stage appraisal process is followed. Initially a preliminary appraisal is carried  out in order to decide the prima facie preparedness of the project to be taken up for detailed appraisal. Detailed  appraisal is carried out for those projects shortlisted on the basis of preliminary appraisal.         The Company along with evaluation of project viability also assesses the ability of its promoter(s) to contribute  equity and complete the project. The Company follows an integrated rating methodology whereby Integrated  Rating (IR) is calculated using the weighted average of the scores of the project grading and promoter grading.  Based on the IR of the project, terms and conditions (including security package, interest rate and debt-equity  ratio) are stipulated.    (b)   Appraisal for State Sector Projects         State sector projects are taken up for detailed appraisal to determine, inter-alia, if they are techno economically /  financially sound and compatible with integrated power development & expansion plans of the State.          The Company classifies state power generation utilities into various risk rating grades based on the evaluation of  utility’s performance against specific parameters covering operational and financial performance. With regards to  transmission utilities, the Company adopts the categorisation of its subsidiary RECL as per its policy. With regard  to State Power Distribution utilities including integrated utilities, the Company’s categorisation policy provides for  adoption of Ministry of Power’s (MoP’s) Integrated Ratings by aligning such ratings / grading with that of Company’s  rating structure. The categorisation of Borrowers in the Logistics and Non-Power Infrastructure sector is carried  out on the basis of recommendations of the Internal Committee considering the strengths and weaknesses of  the project.         Such categories / ratings are used to determine security requirements and pricing of loans given to the State  Sector Borrowers. The Company also has a mechanism in place for monitoring the exposure to borrowers.         The detailed project appraisal involves technical and financial appraisal covering various aspects such as project  inputs,  statutory  and  non-statutory  clearances,  contracts,  implementation  plan,  project  linkages,  financial  modelling / projections, calculation of returns, sensitivity analysis etc.         After detailed analysis indicated above, the overall viability of the project and entity is assessed and various  conditions in the form of pre-commitment, pre-disbursement and other conditions are stipulated so as to ensure  tying up of funds (debt and equity both), all physical inputs, appropriateness of all the contracts, compliance of  conditions precedent in agreements / contracts / statutory and non- statutory clearances related to the project  etc. and in general to ensure bankability of the project & protection of the interest of the Company as a lender  for timely servicing of debt. The Company has an authorisation / delegation structure for the approval of credit  facilities commensurating with the size of the loan.   (ii)   Security and Covenants       The Company stipulates a package of security measures / covenants to mitigate risks during the construction and  post COD (commercial operation date) stage of the project. Based on the risk appetite and appraisal of the project, the  Company adopts a combination of the following measures:     (a)   Primary Security -Charge on Project Assets and / or State Government Guarantees     (b)     Collateral Securities - Corporate guarantee, Personal guarantee of promoters, Pledge of shares, Charge on assets /  revenues of group/other companies     (c)   Payment Security Mechanism - Escrow Account / Letter of Credit, Trust and Retention Account (TRA)     (d)     Other covenants - Assignment of all project contracts, documents, insurance policies in favour of the Company,  Upfront equity requirement, Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA), Debt Equity ratio, shareholders’ agreements,  financial closure, etc.   (iii)   Project Monitoring       The Company has comprehensive project / loan monitoring guidelines that captures aspects relating to monitoring,  tracking of project construction, implementation, identifies risks where intervention is required to minimise the time /  cost overruns / consequent slippages in disbursements and including progress of commissioned projects.        For State sector projects, monitoring is being carried out on the basis of project progress details obtained regularly from  borrowers, site visits, discussions with the borrowers, information/reports available on Central Electricity Authority’s  (CEA) website etc.       For private sector, where the Company is Lead Financial Institution (FI), the Company engages Lenders’ Engineers  (LEs) / Project Management Agency (PMA) (a single entity, thereby facilitating better coordination of project  monitoring activities) / Lenders’ Financial Advisors (LFAs), which are independent agencies to act on behalf of various  lenders / consortium members. The PMA / LEs conduct periodic site visits, review relevant documents, discusses with  the borrowers and submit its reports on progress of the project. LFAs submit the statements of fund flow and utilisation  of funds in the project periodically. In cases the Company is not the lead FI, the tasks related to PMA / LEs and LFAs  services are coordinated with the concerned lead lender.       Also, the consolidated periodic progress report of certain projects is prepared comprising important observations /  issues viz. areas of concern, reasons for delay, issues affecting project construction / implementation etc. and is reviewed  by the Company on a regular basis.       The Company continuously monitors delays and / or default of borrowers and their recoverability. On occurrence of  default in the borrower’s account, the Company initiates necessary steps which may involve action(s) including, but  not limited to, Special Mention Account (SMA) reporting to RBI, credit information reporting to Central Repository  of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) etc., regularisation of the account by recovering all over dues, invocation of  guarantees / securities to recover the dues, conversion of loan into equity as per loan agreement, restructuring of loan  account, formulating resolution plan with the borrower, change in ownership, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process  (CIRP) under IBC -2016, sale of the exposures to other entities/investors, other recovery mechanisms like referring  the case for legal action before Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), SARFAESI, etc. and other actions as specified under  regulatory / legal framework. 318 319 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 40.1.2 Credit Risk Measurement - Impairment Assessment for Lending Operations   (i)   Staging of loans       Ind-AS 109 outlines a three staged model for measurement of impairment based on changes in credit risk since initial  recognition. For classification of its borrowers into various stages, the Company uses the following basis:      -     A financial asset that is not credit impaired on initial recognition is classified in ‘Stage 1’.      -     If a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) is identified, the financial asset is moved to ‘Stage 2’.        An assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed at each reporting  date by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial assets. In  accordance with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’, the Company has applied rebuttable presumption that considers  more than 30 days past due as a parameter for determining significant increase in credit risk. Further, in case of private  sector borrowers, other factors like downgradation in external credit rating to ‘C-’, restructuring resulting in asset  downgradation as per IRAC norms, delay in commissioning of project for more than 4 years are also considered.     -     If the financial asset is credit-impaired, it is moved to ‘Stage 3’ category.       In case of Stage 3 financial assets, after implementation of the resolution plan (except for change of ownership and/or  resolution through NCLT), the financial asset is upgraded and classified as Stage 2 for four quarters from the date of  implementation of resolution plan.   (ii)   Default       In accordance with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’, the Company considers the rebuttable presumption to define  a financial asset as in default, i.e. when the loan account is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments.  Credit impaired financial assets are aligned with the definition of default.   (iii)   Measurement of Expected Credit Loss (ECL)       The Company recognises impairment loss allowance for the financial assets in accordance with a Board-approved  expected credit loss (ECL) policy. ECL is measured on either a 12 month or lifetime basis depending on whether there  is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. ECL is the product of Probability of default (PD), Loss Given  Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). The Company has appointed an independent agency, CRISIL Ltd., for  assessment of ECL in accordance with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’. The brief methodology of computation of ECL  is as follows:    (a)   Probability of default (PD)         PD is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. It is estimated as at a point in time. For  assessing 12-month PD, probability of a loan defaulting in next 12 months is ascertained and similarly for assessing  lifetime PD, probability of a loan defaulting in its remaining lifetime is ascertained.         For Stage 1 accounts, 12 months PD is used.         For Stage 2 (significantly increased credit risk accounts), Lifetime PD is used.       For Stage 3 (credit impaired accounts), 100% PD is taken.         12-month PD: In case of State Sector borrowers, for the purpose of PD calculation, the risk rating grades of the  utilities are considered. For Gencos / Transcos / Others, PFC’s internal rating grades have been considered. For  Discoms / Power Department borrowers, PFC has adopted the MoP ratings. The ratings as above has been be  mapped with the standard external rating benchmarks. The PD factor associated with the mapped external rating  as given in the PD transition matrix published by various CRAs have been used for PD calculation.          In case of Private sector borrowers, the latest external rating as published by various Credit Rating Agencies have  been referred to compute PD using the PD transition matrix published by various CRAs. If external rating is not  available, the PD has been computed through Proxy Risk Scoring Model on a 10-point scale with 1 suggesting  minimum risk and 10 suggesting the highest risk. The said model uses the Quantitative financial ratios like Gearing  (Debt / Equity), Return on Capital Employed, Interest Coverage ratio, Debt to EBITDA ratio and qualitative factors  like PLF, ACS / ARR ratio or LAF to arrive at the final Risk score. The financial risk score obtained have been mapped  to external rating benchmarks. This mapped rating has been referred to compute PD associated with the rating  using the PD transition matrix published by various CRAs.       For Lifetime PD: Markov Chain Model has been used to compute Lifetime PDs of the rating grade.    (b)   Loss Given Default (LGD)         LGD is the loss factor which the Company may experience in case the default occurs.         For State sector borrowers, the exposure is bifurcated into guaranteed and non guaranteed portion. Flat LGD has  been applied to the exposure amount which is guaranteed by the State. For non guaranteed portion, the Company  considers the credit worthiness of the states on various parameters while estimating the LGD. For estimating the  credit worthiness of the state, parameters like State GDP per capita, Fiscal deficit / GDP ratio, Proportion of infra  and developmental expenditure and Proportion on Revenue Expenditure on Energy Sector, etc. are used as key  inputs. The state utilities are bifurcated into Low, Medium and High-risk category based on the state category.  Moreover, for non-guaranteed portfolio of State Sector borrowers, additional stress factors have been considered  in the estimation of LGD based on their respective rating groups to account for the likelihood of default owing to  borrower’s adverse financial conditions or inability to repay.Thus, the Company derives the realisable value of the  assets by considering stress factor(s) based on financial health of the state and rating of the borrower. In case of  Private sector borrowers, LGD has been assessed considering various factors related to the project to arrive at  realisable value of the plant such as generation capacity, project cost per MW, percentage completion of the plant,  and book value of the assets, cost incurred and other relevant information. A stress factor was also applied as a  haircut to arrive at the realisable value.         For Stage 3 borrowers, LGD has been assessed project wise based on Bid value / resolution plan amount/OTS  amount / any other value / discounted cash flows etc. as applicable.    (c)   Exposure at Default (EAD)         Exposure at Default is the outstanding exposure on which ECL is computed. EAD includes outstanding principal  and interest accrued and interest overdues on financial assets that the Company expects to be owed in the event  of default in respect of the loan. As per Note 6.1.(ii), income on credit impaired assets is recognised as and when  received or on accrual basis when expected realisation is higher than the loan amount outstanding, therefore, the  same is not used in computation of Exposure at default.    (d)   Key assumptions used in measurement of ECL         The Company considers the date of initial recognition as the base date from which significant increase in credit risk  is determined.       -     Since the Company has a right to cancel any sanctioned but undrawn limits to any of its borrowers, EAD is  assumed to be outstanding balance and interest of the loan as on the reporting date.    (e)    The calculation of ECL incorporates forward-looking information. Further, the independent agency appointed to  assist the Company in ECL assessment also consider the forward-looking information in the determination of the  impairment allowance to be assigned to the borrower, by taking into consideration various project operational  parameters, project financial ratios, extension of the project completion and also possibility of stressed and  favourable economic conditions. Further, the independent agency has also added some additional macroeconomic  parameters such as Power demand, GDP growth, monthly weighted average prices of traded power and current  account to arrive at a weighted shock factor to the base PD term structure for ECL computation so as to reflect the  right risk assessment of the utilities. 320 321 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Refer Note 11  ‘Loans’ for Company’s exposure to credit risk arising from loans.       For financial guarantee issued, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount that the Company  would have to pay if the guarantees are called upon. For irrevocable loan commitments, the maximum exposure to  credit risk is the full amount of the commitment facilities. Refer Note 46 for exposure of Guarantee and Outstanding  Disbursement Commitments. The credit quality and maximum exposure (Principal outstanding) to credit risk based on days past due and year end  stage classification of loans is tabulated below. ( H  in crore) Days past Due (DPD) As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Total Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Total No overdue  5,01,495.96   -   307.07   5,01,803.03   4,34,204.39   441.45*   -   4,34,645.84  1-30 days   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -  31-60 days   -   29,650.31   -   29,650.31   -   30,742.84   -   30,742.84  61-90 days   -   1,457.29   -   1,457.29   -   -   -   -  More than 90 days   -   -   10,209.78   10,209.78   -   -   16,073.22   16,073.22  Total   5,01,495.96   31,107.60   10,516.85   5,43,120.41   4,34,204.39   31,184.29   16,073.22   4,81,461.90  Impairment loss  allowance  5,381.05   560.76   8,424.25   14,366.06   3,732.95   175.83   11,962.53   15,871.31      * Classified in Stage-II pursuant to resolution plan implemented without change in ownership.   (ii)   Concentration of credit risk       Credit concentration risk refers to risk associated with large credit/investment exposure to a single company or a group  of companies based on its ownership, sector, region etc. that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations  to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, with the potential to adversely affect lender’s  core operations.       The following table sets out an analysis of risk concentration of overall loan portfolio on the basis of similar  risk characteristics: ( H  in crore) Particulars As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Principal  outstanding Impairment loss  allowance* Principal  outstanding Impairment loss  allowance* Concentration by ownership Loans to state sector (i.e., entities under the control of state  and / or central government)  4,20,549.01   4,974.60   3,89,525.42   3,059.63  Loans to private sector  1,22,571.40   9,442.16   91,936.48   12,811.68  Total  5,43,120.41   14,416.76   4,81,461.90   15,871.31      * Including impairment loss allowance on Letter of Comfort & Letter of Undertaking of  H   50.71 crore (as at 31.03.2024  H   48.63 crore).       Loans to state sector are well diversified as these are extended to multiple entities under the control of various State  Governments and Central Government. The Company considers that these loans have a low credit risk in comparison to  lending to private sector mainly due to low default / loss history in state sector and availability of government guarantee  in certain loans. Presence of Government interest in these projects also lowers the risk of non-recoverability of dues.        Further, the Company has a lending portfolio comprising of loans to generation, renewable, transmission, distribution,  power projects & other infrastructure projects spread across diverse geographical areas.

The risk arises from the mismatches in the timing of the cash flows which are inherent in all financing operations and  can be affected by a range of company specific and market wide events.     In order to effectively manage liquidity risk, the Company endeavours to maintain sufficient cash flows to cover maturing  liabilities without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation and also endeavours to  maintain a diversified fund base by raising resources through different funding instruments. The adequacy of the Company’s  liquidity position is determined keeping in view the current liquidity position, anticipated future funding needs, present and  future earning capacity and available sources of funds.     The Company manages its day to day liquidity to ensure that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligation  as & when due. The long-term liquidity is managed keeping in view the long-term fund position and the market factors. This  is in line with the Board approved framework and breaches, if any, are to be reported as per approved framework. The  Company has never defaulted in servicing of its borrowings. 326 327 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     The Company enters into various derivative transactions viz. principal only swaps, options and forward contracts for hedging  the exchange rate risk. As per extant policy, a system for reporting and monitoring of risks is in place wherein Committee for  Management of Risks on Foreign Currency Borrowings, consisting of senior executives of the Company, monitors the foreign  currency exchange rate. These derivative transactions are done for hedging purpose and not for trading or speculative  purpose. The policy lays down the appropriate systems and controls to identify, measure and monitors, the currency risk for  reporting to the Management. (iii)   Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis     The following table presents the impact on total equity [Gain / (Loss)] for 5% change in foreign currency exchange rate against  INR on unhedged portfolio of outstanding foreign currency borrowings: ( H  in crore) Foreign Currency Liabilities As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Decrease Increase Decrease Increase On account of change in foreign exchange rate USD  1.47   (1.47)  252.13   (252.13) EURO  137.23   (137.23)  172.28   (172.28) JPY  79.24   (79.24)  10.04   (10.04) GBP  -   -   -   -  Total  217.94   (217.94)  434.45   (434.45) (iv)   Refer Note 41 for disclosures related to hedge accounting. 40.4 Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk 40.4.1     Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest  rates. The impact may be beneficial or adverse depending on the direction of change in interest rates and whether assets  or liabilities re-price faster. (i)   Interest rate risk is managed with the objective to control market risk exposure while optimising the return.     The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) tracks the interest rate risk through the gap analysis i.e. by analysing the mismatches  between Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities. For gap analysis, the interest rate sensitivity statement  prescribed by RBI is used, wherein the gap is measured between the Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities which  are distributed based on the maturity date or the re-pricing date whichever is earlier.     Further, for managing the interest rate risk, the Company reviews its interest rates periodically based on prevailing market  conditions, borrowing cost, yield, spread, competitors’ rates, etc. The asset mix is managed by the Company through its  interest rate & credit policies which inter-alia covers aspects like reset periods; repayment periods, prepayment premium  etc. The liabilities are managed keeping in view factors like cost, market appetite, timing, market scenario, ALM gap position  etc. The Company also enters into various derivatives transactions like interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate  swaps to hedge its interest rate risk.   The exposure of the Company’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are: ( H  in crore) Particulars As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Fixed Rate Borrowings  3,02,058.41   3,02,902.78  Floating Rate Borrowings  1,63,704.67   1,04,480.54  Total Borrowings  4,65,763.08   4,07,383.32  (ii)   Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis     As per RBI Guidelines, Earning at Risk (EaR) is an important focal point for interest risk management. For Interest Rate  Sensitivity analysis, the impact of movement of interest rates has been measured on the Earning at Risk derived from the  gap statements. The impact has been worked out considering 25 basis upward / downward shocks to interest rates over a  one-year period, assuming a constant balance sheet. The analysis shows that if rates are increased/decreased by 25 bps, the  impact on EaR will be (+/-)  H   213.56 crore. (As at 31.03.2024 (+/-)  H   315.68 crore).     The analysis assumes that the Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities are being re-priced at the same time.  Further, the analysis considers the earliest / first re-pricing date of the Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities.     Note: A 25 basis point increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in  interest rates. 40.4.2 Disclosures in respect of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform The Company has successfully completed its transition from LIBOR to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs), such as the Secured  Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONA), in line with applicable transitional provisions. Accordingly, the loan agreements and derivatives are now referenced to these alternative benchmarks. 40.5 Market Risk – Price risk (i)      The Company is exposed to price risks arising from investments in listed equity shares. Refer Note 12 ‘Investments’ for  Company’s exposure to the same. (ii)    Sensitivity Analysis     The table below represents the impact on Statement of Profit and Loss for 5% increase or decrease in the respective prices  on Company’s quoted equity investments, outside the group: ( H  in crore) Foreign Currency Liabilities As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Impact on P&L  11.51   (11.51)  9.70   (9.70) Impact on OCI  117.53   (117.53)  121.13   (121.13) 41.   HEDGE ACCOUNTING     The hedging instruments which meets the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedge. The  effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  in Other Comprehensive Income. The change in intrinsic value of hedging instruments is recognised in ‘Effective Portion  of Cash Flow Hedges’. The amounts recognised in such reserve are reclassified to the Statement of Profit or Loss when the  hedged item affects profit or loss. Further, the change in fair value of the time value of a hedging instruments is recognised  in ‘Cost of Hedging Reserve’. The amounts recognised in such reserve are amortised to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a  systematic basis. (i)   Hedge Effectiveness     Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness  assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Company  applies the following effectiveness testing strategies:   a)     For derivatives other than options that exactly match the terms of the hedged item, the economic relationship and  hedge effectiveness are based on the qualitative factors using critical terms match method (where principal terms of  the hedging instrument and the hedged item are same).   b)     For option structures, the Company analyses the relationship of changes in value of the hedging instrument and hedged  item using regression analysis. 330 331 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Such  agreements are being used to hedge the exposure to the changes in fair value of fixed rate borrowings.     There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the terms of the interest rate  swap match the terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e., notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates). As such, a hedge ratio  of 1:1 for the hedging relationships has been established as the underlying risk of the interest rate swap is identical to the  hedged risk component.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 44.1 Defined contribution plans: (a)   Pension     The Company pays fixed contribution to National Pension Scheme (NPS) for its pension obligation towards employees at pre- determined rates into the Tier-I NPS Accounts (Pension Accounts) of the employees.     An amount of  H   6.92 crore (previous year  H   11.07 crore) for the year is recognised as expense in the Standalone Statement of  Profit and Loss on account of the Company’s contribution to the defined contribution plans. 44.2 Defined benefit plans: (a)   Provident Fund     The Company pays fixed contribution on account of provident fund at prescribed rates to a separate trust, which invests the  funds in permitted securities. Accordingly, the fund is a defined contribution plan. However, considering that the fund trust  has to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by GoI and shortfall, if any needs to be compensated  by the Company, from FY 2024-25, the Company has started treating the provident fund trust as defined benefit plan for  accounting purposes. As per the actuarial valuation, the fund has adequate corpus for meeting its obligation, therefore no  further provision is considered necessary and there is no impact of above on the profit of the Company.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (e)   Risk exposure     Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are  detailed below:   i)   Investment risk       Most of the plan asset investments are in government securities, other fixed income securities with high rating grades  and mutual funds. The fair value of these assets is subject to volatility due to change in interest rates and other market  & macro-economic factors. There is also a risk of asset liability mismatch i.e. the cash flow for plan assets does not  match with cash flow for plan liabilities.   ii)   Changes in discount rate       The present value of defined benefit plan liabilities is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to  government bonds’ yields at the end of the reporting period. A decrease (increase) in discount rate will increase (decrease)  present values of plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ investments.   iii)   Mortality rate risk        The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of  plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants  will increase the plan’s liability.   iv)   Salary escalation risk       The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.  As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.   v)   Turnover rate / Withdrawal rate of employee       If the actual employee withdrawal rate in the future turns out to be more or less than expected then it may result in  increase/decrease in the liability. (f)   Plan Assets   The fair value of plan assets for each category is as follows:  ( H  in crore) Particulars As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Provident  Fund Gratuity PRMS Provident  Fund Gratuity PRMS Cash & Cash Equivalents  1.47   0.08   0.17  1.46  0.10   1.07  State / Central Government Debt Securities  239.14   16.96   46.22  223.76  16.81   40.80  Corporate Bonds / Debentures  161.50   12.20   29.51  164.93  12.08   24.72  Others  20.66   1.19   1.18  17.01  0.97   -  Total  422.77   30.44   77.08   407.16   29.96   66.59      As at 31.03.2025  H   0.80 crore (as at 31.03.2024  H   1.10 crore) is included in the value of plan assets in respect of the Company’s  own financial instruments (corporate bonds).

(g)   Significant actuarial assumptions     The most recent actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out  as at 31.03.2025 by TransValue Consultants. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service  cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The Company actively monitors how the duration and expected yield of investments are matching the expected cash  outflows arising from employee benefit obligations. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single  investment would not have a material impact on overall level of assets.

Independent Auditors’ Report TO THE MEMBERS OF POWER FINANCE CORPORATION LIMITED REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.   OPINION     We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial  Statements of Power Finance Corporation Limited  (hereinafter referred to as “Holding Company”) and its  Four subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries  together referred to as “the Group”), and its Eleven  associates, which comprise the Consolidated Balance  Sheet as at 31 st  March, 2025, the Consolidated Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  (including  Other  Comprehensive  Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity  and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the  year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated Financial  Statements, including a summary of material accounting  policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter  referred to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).     In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and based on  the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate  Financial Statements and on the other financial information of  the subsidiaries and associates, the aforesaid Consolidated  Financial Statements give the information required by the  Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required  and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian  Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the  Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting  principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated  state of affairs of the Group, and its associates as at 31 st   March,  2025,  of  consolidated  profit  (including  other  comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity  and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended on  that date. 2.   BASIS FOR OPINION     We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing  (SAs)  specified  under  Section  143(10)  of  the  Act.  Our  responsibilities under those Standards are further  described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit  of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of  our report. We are independent of the Group and its  associates in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”)  together with the ethical requirements that are relevant  to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s  Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we  have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated  Financial Statements.  3.   KEY AUDIT MATTERS     Key audit matters (“KAM”) are those matters that, in  our professional judgement, were of most significance  in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  of the current year. These matters were addressed in  the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters. We have determined the matters  described below to be the Key Audit Matters to be  communicated in our report. For each matter below,  description of how our audit addressed the matter is  provided in that context. Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter Auditors’ Response (i) Impairment  of  financial  instruments  -  Loan  Assets  and  Undisbursed letter of comfort The Holding Company follows a Board approved methodology  wherein assessment for allowance is carried out by an External  Agency for Impairment based on certain guidelines and procedures  in respect of criterion/framework classifying the assets into  various stages depending upon credit risk and level of evidence of  Impairment.  Impairment loss measurement requires use of statistical models  to estimate the Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default  (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). These models are key driver  to measure Impairment loss. The key indicators underlying for assessment of impairment  allowance are appraised on the ongoing basis by the management.  The most significant areas where we identified greater levels of  management Judgements are: Our audit procedures included: •     The Holding Company has availed services of an External Agency for  assessment of ECL, whose report has been provided to us. We verified  the criterion / framework with applicable regulatory requirements  along with Company’s internal guidelines and procedures in respect  of the impairment allowance. •     Verified loan assets by applying the standard audit procedures with  respect to the credit appraisal, sanctioning, documentation, review  and monitoring process of the Company. Also, loan balances were  verified basis external confirmation from the borrowers and assessed  quality of the borrower based on recovery and other criteria as per  the credit policy of the Company. •     Reviewed the underlying assumptions and broad methodology of  ECL assessment. Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter Auditors’ Response Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) – Company has classified  SICR  based  on  the  indicator  defined  in  Ind  AS,  estimate  the  Probabilities of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and  Individually assessed Stage 3 carrying value. The carrying value  of loans and advances to borrowers may be materially misstated  if individual impairments are not appropriately estimated based  upon certain assumptions, future cash flow and asset valuations. Considering  the  effect  of  these  matters,  as  part  of  our  risk  assessment, we determined that the value of Expected Credit Loss  (ECL) has a high degree of estimation & uncertainty. In view of the  significance of the amount of loan assets out of total assets in the  Consolidated Financial Statements, impairments of loan assets  have been considered as key audit matter in our audit. [Refer  Note  No.  46.1.2  to  46.1.8  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements read with Accounting Policy No. 6.4.1 (iii)]. •     Components and calculations in the study for impairment allowance  carried out by the independent expert have been test checked,  discussed with the management and relied upon by us. Also, our  audit procedure in this regard is limited since certain parameters  of study being considered confidential have not been shared by the  aforesaid expert. We considered the credit impairment charge and provision recognised  and the related disclosures to be acceptable & satisfactory. (ii) Fair Valuation of Derivative financial instruments  The Holding Company enters into derivative contracts in accordance  with RBI guidelines to mitigate its currency and interest rate risk in  accordance with currency risk management policy approved by the  Board of Directors of the Holding Company. Derivative contracts are either categorised at Fair Value through  P&L (FVTPL) or under cash flow hedge (Hedge Accounting). Mark to  market gain/loss on derivatives categorised at FVTPL is recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss and that of Hedge Accounting is  recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income.  We consider the valuation of the derivative financial instruments  and hedge accounting as a key audit matter due to material  exposure and the fact that the inappropriate application of these  requirements /assumptions / estimate by contracting bank could  lead to a material effect on the income statement. (Refer  Note  No.  6.4.3,  46.3  &  47  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements) Our audit procedures included:  The Holding Company has availed services of an independent expert for  preparation of a model for derivative accounting as per Ind AS 109.  Discussed with management to have an understanding of its perception  and also reviewed policy of the Company for risk management.  Evaluated  key  internal  controls  over  classification  of  derivative  instruments.  The Company obtains fair value of derivative from the counterparty banks  as on the reporting date, which are relied upon by us. Our procedure  included evaluation of details of various financial derivative contracts  outstanding as on 31 st  March, 2025 and fair value thereof. Additionally, we verified the accounting of gain or loss on mark to market  basis of derivative contracts in Statement of Profit & Loss and other  comprehensive income in case of derivatives contracts under cash flow  hedge. Based on the aforesaid procedure, we have reviewed accounting of  derivatives in the books of account and assessed that the related  disclosures are given in the financial statements. In the case of subsidiary REC Limited, the following key audit matters are reported by their Joint Statutory Auditors: Sr.  No. Key Audit Matter Auditors’ Response 1 Impairment allowance of Loan Assets –  The Company follows a Board approved methodology wherein  assessment for allowance is carried out by an external agency for  impairment based on certain criterion/framework classifying the  assets into various stages depending upon credit risk and level of  evidence of impairment. Impairment allowance is measured as product of the Probability of  Default, Exposure at Default and Loss Given Default being the key  parameters for assessing the impairment allowance. The key indicators underlying for assessment of impairment  allowance are appraised on an ongoing basis by the management. Further the management has adopted a methodology which in  addition to the model adopted as above is further analyzed on case  to case basis and wherever impairment impact need to be changed  the same is considered in the financial statements.

Mark to market gain/loss on derivatives categorised at  FVTPL is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss and that of cash  flow hedge is recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. In  view of significance and impact on the financial statements we have  considered the fair valuation of the derivative financial instruments  as a key audit matter.

INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND AUDITOR’S REPORT THEREON      The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible  for the preparation of the other information. The other  information comprises the information included in the  Company’s Director’s Report including Annexures to  Director’s Report, Management Discussion and Analysis,  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and  Report on Corporate Governance (collectively referred  to as “other information”) but does not include the  Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditors’  report thereon. The above-referred information is  expected to be made available to us after the date of this  Auditor’s report.     Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.     In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information identified above when it became available  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information  is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial  Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course  of audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.      If, based on the work we have performed, we concluded  that there is a material misstatement of this other  information, we are required to report that fact, we have  nothing to report in this regard. 5.     RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND  THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE  FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS      The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible  for the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated  Financial Statements in terms of the requirements of the  Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) that give a true and fair  view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated  financial  performance  (including  Other  Comprehensive  Income), consolidated statement of changes in equity and  consolidated cash flows of the Group including its associates  in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting  principles generally accepted in India. The respective board  of directors of the Companies included in the Group and  its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate  accounting records in accordance with the provisions  of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  the selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; making judgements and estimates that are  reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,  that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation  of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Holding  Company, as aforesaid. 362 363 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused. Responsibly-Led. 

    In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the  respective Board of Directors of the Companies included  in the Group and of its associates are responsible for  assessing the ability of the Group and of its associates  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,  matters related to going concern and using the going  concern basis of accounting unless respective Board  of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective  entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic  alternative but to do so.     The respective Board of Directors of the Companies  included in the Group and of its associates are also  responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process  of the Group and of its associates. 6.    AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE  AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS     Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a  whole are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high  level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can  arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated  Financial Statements.      As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:    •     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or  the override of internal control.    •     Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section  143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also  responsible for expressing our opinion on whether  the Group and its associates have adequate internal  financial controls system in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls.   •     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management.    •     Conclude on the appropriateness of management  of holding Company’s use of the going concern basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its  associates and to continue as a going concern. If we  conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are  required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to  the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial  Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group and its associates  to cease to continue as a going concern.    •     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  Consolidated Financial Statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation.    •     Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the financial information of the entities  or business activities within the Group and its  associates to express an opinion on the Consolidated  Financial Statements. We are responsible for the  direction, supervision and performance of the audit  of the Financial Statements of such entities included  in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we  are the independent auditors. For the other entities  included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,  which have been audited by other auditors, such  other auditors remain responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audits carried  out by them. We remain solely responsible for our  audit opinion.      Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the  Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in  aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions  of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  may  be  influenced.  We  consider  quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i)  planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating  the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect  of  any  identified  misstatements  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.     We communicate with those charged with governance of  the Holding Company regarding, among other matters,  the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit  findings,  including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal control that we identify during our audit.      We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.     From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore  the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our  auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public  disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare  circumstances, we determine that a matter should  not be communicated in our report because the  adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably  be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of  such communication.  7.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR  INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS     The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company,  its Subsidiary Companies, and its Associate Companies  are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal  financial  controls  based  on  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  criteria  established  by  the  Holding  Company, its Subsidiary Companies, its Associate  Companies, which are Companies incorporated in  India, considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These  responsibilities include the design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that  were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to  the respective Company’s policies, the safeguarding of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and  errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 2.   AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY     Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal  financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements of the Holding Company, its subsidiary  companies, and its associate companies, based on our  audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the  Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI prescribed under  Sub-section 10 of Section 143 of the Act, to the extent  applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those  Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether internal  financial controls with reference to Financial Statements  were established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects.     Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence  about  the  internal  financial  controls  system  with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements  and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal  financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements included obtaining an understanding of  internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated  Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based on  the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks  of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error.     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor in  terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters  paragraph below is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal  financial controls system with reference to Consolidated  Financial Statements. 3.     MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL  CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO  CONSOLIDATED IND AS FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS     A Company’s internal financial control with reference to  financial  statements  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial  Statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  financial  statements includes those policies and procedures that (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated Financial  Statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of the Company are being made only in accordance with  authorisation of management of the Company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or  disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a  material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 368 369 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

4.    INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL  FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE  TO CONSOLIDATED IND AS FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS     Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls with reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be  detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to Financial Statements  to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements may become inadequate because of changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the  policies or procedures may deteriorate. 5.    OPINION     In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiaries,  its associates which are Companies incorporated in  India have, in all material respects, an internal financial  controls system with reference to Financial Statements  and  such  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  Financial Statements were operating effectively as at 31 st   March, 2025, based on the internal control over financial  reporting criteria established by the Company considering  the essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.  6.    OTHER MATTERS     Our aforesaid reports under Sub-section 3 (i) of Section  143  of  the  Act,  on  the  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in so  far as applicable to one subsidiary is based on the  corresponding report of the joint statutory auditors of  such Company and in respect of three subsidiaries and  eleven associates, we have relied on the explanation  provided by the management of the holding Company  in absence of report on Internal Financial Controls of  such entities. In our opinion, the same is not considered  material for the Consolidated Financial Statements of  the Group. For Thakur, Vaidyanath Aiyar & Co.

GROUP'S MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY  INFORMATION     The Group's material accounting policy information  in regard to preparation of the Consolidated Financial  Statements is as given below: 6.1   Basis of Preparation and Measurement      These Consolidated Financial Statements have been  prepared on going concern basis following accrual  system of accounting. The assets and liabilities have been  measured at historical cost or at amortised cost or at fair  value as applicable at the end of each reporting period.  The functional currency of the Group is Indian Rupees ( H )  except for PIFIL, whose functional currency is USD.      Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date,  regardless of whether that price is directly observable or  estimated using another valuation technique.     Fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1,  2 or 3 as per Ind AS requirement, which are described  as follows:   •     Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in  active markets for identical assets or liabilities that  the entity can access at the measurement date;    •     Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices  included within Level 1, that are observable for the  asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and   •     Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset  or liability. 6.2   Basis of Consolidation     The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the  financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries  (collectively referred as the “Group”). The Group has  investment in joint venture entity and associates which  are accounted using equity method (except when  the  investment  is  classified  as  held  for  sale)  in  these  Consolidated Financial Statements.     The financial statements of Subsidiaries, Joint Venture and  Associates are drawn up to the same reporting date as of  the Company for the purpose of Consolidation. (i)   Subsidiaries:     A subsidiary is an entity over which the Company has  control. The Company controls an entity when the  Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns  from its involvement with the entity and has the ability  to affect those returns through its power to direct the  relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully  consolidated from the date on which the Company  obtains the control (except for Business Combinations  under Common Control).     The Company combines the financial statements of its  subsidiaries on a line by line basis, adding together like  items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.  The carrying amount of the Company’s investment in each  subsidiary and the Company’s portion of equity of each  subsidiary are eliminated. Intercompany transactions,  balances, unrealised gains on transactions between the  Company and subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised  losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides  evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.     Non-controlling interests (NCI) represent the proportion  of income, other comprehensive income and net assets  in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the Company’s  shareholders. Non-controlling interests are initially  measured at the proportionate share of the recognised  amounts  of  the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets.  Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-  controlling interests is the amount of the interest at initial  recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of  subsequent changes in equity.     The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared  using uniform accounting policies consistently for like  transactions and other events in similar circumstances  and are presented to the extent possible, in the  same manner as the Company’s Standalone Financial  Statements except as otherwise stated. When necessary,  adjustments are made to the financial statements to bring  their accounting policies in line with the Group’s material  Accounting Policies.     If the Company loses control over a subsidiary, it  derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary  and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any  interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at  fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain  or loss is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss. 380 381 380 381 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 (ii)   Joint Venture and Associates:     A Joint Venture is a joint arrangement whereby the  parties that have joint control of the arrangement have  rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control  is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an  arrangement, which exists only when decisions about  the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the  parties sharing control.     An Associate is an entity over which the Company has  significant influence. Significant influence is the power to  participate in the financial and operating policy decisions  of the investee but is not control or joint control over  those policies.     The results and assets and liabilities of Joint Venture  or Associates are incorporated in these Consolidated  Financial Statements using the equity method of  accounting, except when the investment or a portion  thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is  measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value  less cost to sell. Under the equity method, an investment  in a Joint Venture or Associate is initially recognised in  the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted  thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the profit or  loss and other comprehensive income of the Joint Venture  or Associate. Distributions received from a joint venture/  associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment.     Upon loss of joint control over the Joint Venture or  significant  influence  over  the  Associate,  the  Company  measures and recognises any retained investment at its  fair value. Any difference between a) the carrying amount  of the Joint Venture or Associate upon loss of joint control  or significant influence respectively and b) the fair value  of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is  recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. 6.3   Cash and Cash Equivalents     Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.  The Group considers cash equivalents as all short-term  balances (with an original maturity of three months or less  from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments  that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash  and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  in value. 6.4   Financial Instruments     Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  when the Group becomes a party to the contractual  provisions of the financial instruments.     On  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities are recognised at fair value plus/ minus  transaction cost that is attributable to the acquisition  or  issue  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities.  In  case of financial assets and financial liabilities which are  recognised at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL),  its transaction costs are recognised in Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss. 6.4.1 Financial Assets     All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are  recognised and derecognised on a settlement date basis.  Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales  of financial assets that require delivery of assets within  the time frame established by regulation or convention in  the marketplace.     After initial recognition, financial assets are subsequently  measured in their entirety at either amortised cost  or  fair  value,  depending  on  the  classification  of  the  financial assets.   (i)     Classification  and  Measurement  of  Financial  Assets  (other  than  Equity  instruments)     (a)   Financial Assets at Amortised Cost:         Financial assets that meet the following  conditions are subsequently measured at  amortised  cost  using  Effective  Interest  Rate  method (EIR):       •     the asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets in order  to collect contractual cash flows; and       •     The contractual terms of the asset give  rise  on  specified  dates  to  cash  flows  that are Solely Payments of Principal  and Interest (SPPI) on the principal  amount outstanding.       Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method         The effective interest rate method is a method  of calculating the amortised cost of financial  asset and of allocating interest income over  the expected life. The Group while applying  EIR method, generally amortises any fee,  transaction costs and other premiums or  discount that are integral part of the effective  interest rate of a financial instrument.         Income is recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss on an effective  interest  rate  basis  for  financial  assets  other  than those classified as at FVTPL.         EIR is determined at the initial recognition of  the financial asset. EIR is subsequently updated  at every reset, in accordance with the terms of  the respective contract.         Once  the  terms  of  financial  assets  are  renegotiated, other than market driven interest  rate movement, any gain / loss measured  using the previous EIR as calculated before the  modification, is recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss in period during  which such renegotiations occur.     (b)      Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Other  Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)         A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if both  the following conditions are met:       •     the objective of the business model is  achieved both by collecting contractual  cash  flows  and  selling  the  financial  asset; and       •     the contractual terms of the asset give  rise  on  specified  dates  to  cash  flows  that are Solely Payments of Principal  and Interest (SPPI) on the principal  amount outstanding.         All fair value changes are recognised in  Consolidated Other Comprehensive Income  (OCI) and accumulated in Consolidated Reserve.     (c)     Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or  Loss (FVTPL)         A financial asset is measured at FVTPL unless  it is measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI,  with all changes in fair value recognised in  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.     Business Model       An assessment of business model for managing  financial assets is fundamental to the classification of  a financial asset. The Group determines the business  model at a level that reflects how financial assets are  managed together to achieve a particular business  objective  of  generating  cash  flows.  The  Group’s  business model assessment is performed at a higher  level of aggregation rather than on an instrument- by-instrument basis.       The Group is primarily in the business of providing  loans across power sector, logistics & infrastructure  sector and such loans are managed to realise the  contractual cash flows over the tenure of the loan.  Further, other financial assets may also be held by  the Group to collect the contractual cash flows.   (ii)     Classification,  Measurement  and  Derecognition of Equity Instruments       All equity investments other than in subsidiaries,  joint ventures and associates are measured at  fair value. Equity instruments which are held for  trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity  instruments, the Group at initial recognition makes  an irrevocable election to classify it as either FVTOCI  or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on an  instrument by instrument basis.        An equity investment classified as FVTOCI is initially  measured at fair value plus transaction costs.  Subsequently, it is measured at fair value and, all fair  value changes are recognised in Consolidated Other  Comprehensive Income (OCI) and accumulated in  Consolidated Reserve. There is no recycling of the  amounts from Consolidated OCI to Consolidated  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss,  even  on  sale  of  investment. However, the Group transfers the  cumulative gain/loss within consolidated equity.       Equity instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss.   (iii)   Impairment of Financial Assets       Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group  recognises  expected  credit  loss  (ECL)  on  financial  assets measured at amortised cost as required  under Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’. The Group  presents the ECL charge or reversal (where the net  amount is a negative balance for a particular period)  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  as “Impairment on financial instruments” and as a  cumulative deduction from gross carrying amount in  the Consolidated Balance Sheet, wherever applicable.       The impairment requirements for the recognition  and measurement of ECL are equally applied to  financial asset measured at FVTOCI except that ECL  is recognised in Consolidated Other Comprehensive  Income and is not reduced from the carrying amount  in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.     (a)     Impairment of Loan Assets and commitments  under Letter of Comfort (LoC) & Letter of  Undertaking (LoU):         The Group measures ECL on loan assets at an  amount equal to the lifetime ECL if there is  credit impairment or there has been significant  increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial  recognition. If there is no SICR as compared  382 383 382 383 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 to initial recognition, the Group measures ECL  at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. When  making the assessment of whether there  has been a SICR since initial recognition, the  Group considers reasonable and supportable  information, that is available without undue  cost  or  effort.  If  the  Group  measured  loss  allowance as lifetime ECL in the previous period,  but determines in a subsequent period that  there has been no SICR since initial recognition  due to improvement in credit quality, the Group  again measures the loss allowance based on  12-month ECL.         ECL is measured on individual basis for credit  impaired loan assets, and on other loan assets  it is generally measured on collective basis  using homogenous groups.         The Group measures impairment on  commitments under LoC & LoU on similar basis  as in case of Loan assets.     (b)     Impairment  of  financial  assets,  other  than  loan assets:          ECL on financial assets, other than loan assets,  is measured at an amount equal to life time  expected losses.      (c)     Financial assets are written off by RECL either  partially or in their entirety only when it has  stopped pursuing the recovery or as directed  by the order of the Judicial Authority.         A write-off constitutes a derecognition event.  The Company may apply enforcement activities  to  financial  assets  written  off/  may  assign  /  sell loan exposure to ARC / Bank / a financial  institution for a negotiated consideration.         Recoveries resulting from the Company's  enforcement activities are recorded in  statement of profit and loss.   (iv)   De-recognition of Financial Assets       The Group derecognises a financial asset when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset  expire,  or  when  it  transfers  the  financial  asset  along with all the substantial risks and rewards  of ownership of the asset to another party. The  renegotiation  or  modification  of  the  contractual  cash  flows  of  a  financial  asset  can  also  lead  to  derecognition of the existing financial asset.       On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the  difference between the asset’s carrying amount and  the sum of the consideration received & receivable,  and the cumulative gain or loss that had been  recognised in Consolidated Other Comprehensive  Income and accumulated in Consolidated Equity, is  recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been  recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss on disposal of that financial asset. 6.4.2 Financial Liabilities   (i)     All  financial  liabilities  other  than  derivatives  and  financial  guarantee  contracts  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest rate (EIR) method.       EIR is determined at the initial recognition of the  financial  liability.  EIR  is  subsequently  updated  for  financial liabilities having floating interest rate, at the  respective reset date, in accordance with the terms  of the respective contract.   (ii)   Financial guarantee       A financial guarantee issued by the Group is initially  measured at fair value and, if not designated as at  FVTPL, is subsequently measured at the higher of:     •     the best estimate of expenditure required to  settle any financial obligation arising as a result  of the guarantee; and     •     the amount initially recognised less, when  appropriate, the cumulative amount of income  recognised in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss.   (iii)   De-recognition of financial liabilities       The  Group  derecognises  financial  liabilities  when,  and only when, the Group’s obligations are  discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference  between the carrying amount of the financial liability  derecognised and the consideration paid & payable  is  recognised  in  Consolidated  Statement  of  Profit  and Loss. 6.4.3 Derivative Financial Instruments   (i)     The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial  instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate  and foreign exchange rate risks.   (ii)     Under hedge accounting, an entity can designate  derivative contracts either as cashflow hedge or fair  value hedge.   (iii)     To qualify for hedge accounting, the  hedging relationship must meet all of the  following requirements:     •     there is an economic relationship between the  hedged item and the hedging instrument.     •     the  effect  of  credit  risk  does  not  dominate  the value changes that result from that  economic relationship.     •     the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is  the same as that resulting from the quantity of  the hedged item that the Group actually hedges  and the quantity of the hedging instrument that  the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity  of hedged item.   (iv)   Cash flow hedge       The hedging instruments which meets the qualifying  criteria for hedge accounting are designated as  cash flow hedge. The effective portion of changes  in the fair value of derivatives that are designated  and  qualify  as  cash  flow  hedges  is  recognised  in Other Comprehensive Income. The change in  intrinsic value of hedging instruments is recognised  in  ‘Effective  Portion  of  Cash  Flow  Hedges’.  The  amounts recognised in such reserve are reclassified  to the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss when  the hedged item affects profit or loss. Further, the  change in fair value of the time value of a hedging  instruments is recognised in ‘Cost of Hedging  Reserve’. The amounts recognised in such reserve  are amortised to the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss on a systematic basis. The gain or  loss  relating  to  ineffective  portion  is  recognised  immediately  in  Consolidated  Statement  of  Profit  and Loss.   (v)   Fair Value hedge   A.   In respect of PFC       PFC remeasures the hedged item for fair value  changes attributable to the hedged risk (i.e. changes  in the benchmark rate). Such fair value hedge  adjustment are recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss at end of every reporting  period. The change in fair value of the underlying  hedged item on account of attributable hedged risk  (benchmark rate) is offset by corresponding change  in fair value of the derivative (Fixed to Float IRS).   B.   In respect of RECL        In line with the recognition of change in the fair value  of the hedging instruments in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit & Loss, the change in the fair  value of the hedged item attributable to the risk  hedged is recognised in the Consolidated Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss.  Such  changes  are  made  to  the carrying amount of the hedged item and are  adjusted in Effective Interest Rate in the period when  the hedging instrument ceases to exist. If the hedged  item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is  recognised immediately in Consolidated Statement  of Profit and Loss.   (vi)    Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires, or terminated, or exercised, or  when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.   (vii)     Derivatives, other than those designated under  hedge relationship, are initially recognised at fair  value at the date the derivative contracts are entered  into and are subsequently re-measured to their  fair value at the end of each reporting period. The  resulting gain or loss is recognised in Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss. 6.4.4 Embedded Derivatives     An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid  instrument that also includes a non-derivative host  contract with the effect that some of the cash flows of  the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand- alone derivative. An embedded derivative cause some  or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required  by the contract to be modified according to a specified  interest rate, foreign exchange rate, or other variable,  provided that, in the case of a non-financial variable, it is  not specific to a party to the contract.     Derivatives embedded in all host contracts are accounted  for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if  their economic characteristics and risks are not closely  related to those of the host contracts or if the embedded  derivative feature leverages the exposure and the host  contracts are not held for trading or designated at fair  value though profit or loss. These embedded derivatives  are measured at fair value with changes in fair value  recognised in profit or loss, unless designated as effective  hedging instruments. 6.5    Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial  Liabilities     Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and  the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet when  currently there is legally enforceable right to offset the  recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle  on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the  liabilities simultaneously. 384 385 384 385 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 6.6    Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  (PPE)  and  Depreciation   (i)     Items of PPE are initially recognised at cost.  Subsequent measurement is done at cost less  accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any, except for freehold land  which is not depreciated. An item of PPE retired from  active use and held for disposal is stated at lower of  its book value or net realisable value.   (ii)     The expenditure incurred on improvement of  leasehold premises is recognised at cost and is  shown as "Leasehold Improvements" under PPE.   (iii)     In case of assets put to use, capitalisation is done  on the basis of bills approved or estimated value of  work done as per contracts where final bill(s) is/are  yet to be received / approved subject to necessary  adjustment in the year of final settlement.   (iv)     Cost of replacing part of an item of PPE is recognised  in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable  that the future economic benefits embodied within  the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be  measured reliably. The carrying amount of the  replaced part is derecognised. Maintenance or  servicing costs of PPE are recognised in Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.   (v)     Under-construction PPE is carried at cost, less any  recognised impairment loss. Such PPE items are  classified to the appropriate categories of property,  plant and equipment when completed and ready for  intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the  same basis as of other assets, commences when the  assets are ready for their intended use.   (vi)     Depreciation  is  recognised  so  as  to  write-off  the  cost of assets less their residual values #  as per  written down value method*, over the useful lives as  prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013,  except following: Nature of PPE Life of PPE Cell phones 2 years (in case of PFC & PFCCL)  Lease hold  improvement (1) Lease period or their useful lives  whichever is shorter (in case of  PFCCL)      #  Residual value is estimated as 5% of the original cost of PPE.         * Depreciation is provided using Straight line method by RECL         (1)    Leasehold Improvements are amortised on straight line basis   (vii)     Depreciation on additions to/deductions from PPE  during the year is charged on pro-rata basis from/ up to the date on which the asset is available for use/ disposed (charged for full month if asset is in use for  more than 15 days in case of RECL).   (viii)    An item of PPE is derecognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected to  arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain  or loss arising on the de-recognition of an item of  PPE is determined as the difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount  of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.   (ix)     Capital expenditure directly attributable for Smart  metering project are initially shown in ‘Capital  work-in-progress’ (net of contribution from client)  and capitalised as PPE when it is ready for use.  Depreciation on items of PPE in smart metering  project is recognised on pro-rata basis on Straight  Line Method over the useful life of assets not  exceeding project implementation period of  99 months.   (x)     Items of PPE costing up to  H   5000/- each are fully  depreciated, in the year of purchase.   (xi)     The cost of PPE under construction at the reporting  date is disclosed as ‘Capital work-in-progress’.  The cost comprises purchase price, borrowing  cost if capitalisation criteria are met and directly  attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working  condition for the intended use. Any trade discount  and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase  price. Advances paid for the acquisition/ construction  of PPE which are outstanding at the Balance Sheet  date are classified under ‘Capital Advances.’ 6.7   Investment property   Recognition and measurement     Investment property are properties held to earn rentals  and/or for capital appreciation.     Investment properties are measured initially at cost,  including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial  recognition, investment properties are measured at  cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment loss, if any. The depreciation is charged on  straight-line method over the useful life of the assets as  prescribed under Part 'C' of Schedule II of the Companies  Act, 2013.   Derecognition     Investment properties are derecognised either when they  have been disposed of or when they are permanently  withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is  expected  from  their  disposal.  The  difference  between  the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount  of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period  of derecognition.     Reclassification  to  /  from  investment  property     Transfers are made to (or from) investment property  only when there is a change in use. Transfers between  investment property and owner-occupied property do not  change the carrying amount of the property transferred  and they do not change the cost of that property for  measurement or disclosure purposes.   Fair value disclosure     The fair value of investment property is disclosed in  the notes. Fair value is determined by an independent  valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional  qualification and has recent experience in the relevant  location and category of the investment property  being valued. 6.8   Intangible Assets and Amortisation   (i)     Intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  that  are acquired separately are recognised at cost.  Cost includes any directly attributable incidental  expenses necessary to make the assets ready for  its intended use. Subsequent measurement is  done at cost less accumulated amortisation and  accumulated impairment losses, if any. Amortisation  is recognised on a straight-line basis over their  estimated useful lives.    (ii)    Expenditure incurred which are eligible for  capitalisation under intangible assets is carried as  Intangible Assets under Development till they are  ready for their intended use. Advances paid for  the acquisition/ development of intangible assets  which are outstanding at the balance sheet date are  classified under ‘Capital Advances’.   (iii)     Estimated useful life of intangible assets with finite  useful lives has been estimated by the Group as 5  years. In case of PFCCL, life is estimated as 36 months.   (iv)     An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are  expected  from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from de- recognition of an intangible asset, measured as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds and  the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when  the asset is derecognised. 6.9   Leases     For recognition, measurement and presentation of lease  contracts, the Group applies the principles of Ind AS 116  ‘Leases’.   (i)   The Group as a lessee       The Group at inception of a contract assesses,  whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A  contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys  the right to control the use of an identified asset  for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  To assess whether a contract conveys the right to  control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset,  the  Group  assesses whether (a) the Group has substantially  all of the economic benefits from use of the asset  through the period of the lease, and (b) the Group  has the right to direct the use of the identified asset.       The Group at inception of a lease contract recognises  a Right-of-Use (RoU) asset at cost and a corresponding  lease liability, except for leases with term of less than  twelve months (short-term) and low-value assets  which are recognised as an operating expense on a  straight-line basis over the term of the lease.       Certain lease arrangements include the options to  extend or terminate the lease before the end of the  lease term. RoU assets and lease liabilities includes  these options when it is reasonably certain that they  will be exercised.       The right-of-use (RoU) assets are initially recognised  at cost, which comprise the initial amount of the  lease liability adjusted for any lease payments  made at or before the inception date of the lease  plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives  received. They are subsequently measured at cost  less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses. The right-of-use assets are  depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term  or useful life of right-of-use assets.       The lease liability is initially measured at amortised  cost at the present value of future lease payments.  The lease payments are discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable,  using the Group’s incremental borrowing rates in the  country of domicile of the leases.       Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding  adjustment to the related right-of-use (RoU) asset if  the Group changes its assessment if whether it will  exercise an extension or a termination option. 386 387 386 387 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Lease liability and RoU asset is separately presented  in the Balance Sheet. Interest expense on lease  liability is presented separately from depreciation on  right of use asset as a component of finance cost in  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Lease  payments  for  the  principal  portion  are  classified  as Cash flow used in financing activities and lease  payments for the interest portion are classified as  Cash flow used in operating activities.   (ii)   The Group as a lessor       Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as  a finance or operating lease. Contracts in which all  the risks and rewards of the lease are substantially  transferred to the lessee are classified as a finance  lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.  For operating leases, rental income is recognised on a  straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.       Amount  due  from  lessee  under  finance  leases  is  recognised as receivable at an amount equal to the  net investment of the Group in the lease. Finance  income on the lease is allocated to accounting  periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of  return on the Group's net investment outstanding in  respect of lease at the reporting date. 6.10   Assets/ Disposal Groups held for sale     Non-current Assets are classified as held for sale if their  carrying amount will be recovered principally through a  sale transaction rather than through continuing use and  the sale is highly probable. A sale is considered as highly  probable when such assets have been decided to be sold  by the Group; are available for immediate sale in their  present condition; are being actively marketed for sale  at a price and the sale has been agreed or is expected to  be concluded within one year of the date of classification.  Such non-current assets are measured at lower of carrying  amount or fair value less cost to sell.     Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised  while  they  are  classified  as  held  for  sale.  Non-current  assets held for sale are presented separately from other  assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.     Where the Group is committed to a sale plan involving  loss of control of an entity, it classifies investment in the  entity (i.e. all the assets and liabilities of that entity) as  held for sale. 6.11    Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities  and  Contingent Assets   (i)     Provisions are recognised when the Group has a  present legal or constructive obligation as a result  of a past event, if it is probable that the Group will  be required to settle the obligation and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.   (ii)     The amount recognised as a provision is the best  estimate of the consideration required to settle the  present obligation at the end of the reporting period,  taking into account the risks and uncertainties  surrounding the obligation.   (iii)     When some or all of the economic benefits required  to settle a provision are expected to be recovered  from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an  asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will  be received and the amount of the receivable can be  measured reliably.   (iv)     Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required or the amount cannot be  estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as  contingent liability in notes to accounts, unless  the  probability  of  outflow  of  economic  benefits  is remote.   (v)     Contingent assets are not recognised in the  Consolidated Financial Statements. However,  contingent assets are disclosed in the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  when  inflow  of  economic  benefits is probable. 6.12    Recognition of Income and Expenditure   (i)     Interest  income  on  financial  assets  subsequently  measured at amortised cost, is recognised using the  Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. The Effective  Interest Rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts  estimated future cash receipts through expected  life of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying  amount on initial recognition.   (ii)     Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  recoveries  from  the borrowers of RECL are appropriated in the  order of (i) costs and expenses of RECL (ii) delayed  and penal interest including interest tax, if any (iii)  overdue interest including interest tax, if any and (iv)  repayment of principal; the oldest being adjusted  first, except for credit impaired loans and recalled  loans, where principal amount is appropriated  only after the complete recovery of other costs,  expenses, delayed and penal interest and overdue  interest including interest tax, if any. The recoveries  under One Time Settlement (OTS)/ Insolvency  and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings are  appropriated first towards the principal outstanding  and remaining recovery thereafter, towards interest  and other charges, if any.   (iii)     Interest on financial assets subsequently measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  and  loss  (FVTPL),  is  recognised on accrual basis in accordance with the  terms of the respective contract and is disclosed  separately under the head ‘Interest Income’   (iv)     Rebate on account of timely payment of dues by  borrowers is recognised on receipt of entire dues in  time, in accordance with the terms of the respective  contract and is netted against the corresponding  interest income.   (v)     The Group uses the principles laid down by Ind AS  115 to determine that how much and when revenue  is recognised, what is the nature, amount, timing  and uncertainty of revenues etc. In accordance with  the  same,  revenue  is  recognised  through  a  five- step approach:     a.   Identify the contract(s) with customer;     b.     Identify separate performance obligations in  the contract;     c.   Determine the transaction price;     d.    Allocate the transaction price to the  performance obligations; and     e.     Recognise revenue when a performance  obligation is satisfied.       Revenues are measured at the fair value of the  consideration received or receivable, net of discounts  and other indirect taxes.       In Cost Plus Contracts - Revenue is recognised by  including eligible contractual items of expenditures  plus proportionate margin as per contract;       In Fixed Price Contracts – Revenue is recognised on  the basis of stage of completion of the contract. The  Group has assessed that the stage of completion  is determined as the proportion of the total time  expected to complete the performance obligation  to that has lapsed at the end of the reporting  period, which is an appropriate measure of progress  towards complete satisfaction of these performance  obligations under Ind AS 115.       Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress  toward completion are revised if circumstances  change. Any resulting increases or decreases in  estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or  loss in the period in which the circumstances that give  rise to the revision become known by management.   (vi)     Revenue from consulting services, in connection with  development of Independent Transmission Projects  (ITP) and Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPP) taken  up as per the directions from the Ministry of Power,  Government of India, is recognised on completed  contract method basis i.e. when the ITP /UMPP  created for the project is transferred to a successful  bidder evidenced by share purchase agreement. The  expenses incurred on development of these projects  which are not recovered as direct costs are recovered  through billing manpower charges at agreed charge  out rates decided by the management.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 using exchange rates prevailing on the last day of the  reporting period. Exchange differences on monetary  items are recognised in the Consolidated Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  arise. However, for the long-term monetary items  recognised in the consolidated financial statements  before April 1 2018, such exchange differences are  accumulated in a Foreign Currency Monetary Item  Translation Difference Account” and amortised over  the balance period of such long-term monetary item.   (ii)     Financial statements of foreign operations whose  functional currency is different than Indian Rupees  are translated into Indian Rupees as follows:     (a)     assets and liabilities for each Balance Sheet  presented are translated at the closing rate at  the date of that Balance Sheet;     (b)    income and expenses for each income  statement are translated at average exchange  rates; and     (c)     all  resulting  exchange  differences  are  recognised in other comprehensive income  and accumulated in equity as foreign  currency translation reserve for subsequent  reclassification to profit or loss on disposal of  such foreign operations. 6.14 Borrowing Costs     Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that  the Group incurred in connection with the borrowing of  funds. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to  the acquisition and/ or construction of a qualifying asset,  till the time such a qualifying asset becomes ready for its  intended use, are capitalised. A qualifying asset is one  that necessarily takes a substantial period to get ready for  its intended use.     All other borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss on an accrual basis as per the  effective interest rate method. 6.15 Employee Benefits    In respect of PFC   (i)   Defined Contribution Plan        Company’s contribution paid / payable during the  reporting period towards pension is charged in the  Statement of Profit and Loss when employees have  rendered service entitling them to the contributions.    (ii)   Defined Benefit Plan       The Company’s obligation towards provident fund,  gratuity to employees and post-retirement benefits  such  as  medical  benefit,  economic  rehabilitation  benefit, and settlement allowance after retirement  are determined using the projected unit credit  method, with actuarial valuations being carried out  at the end of each annual reporting period. Actuarial  gain / loss on re-measurement of gratuity and  other post-employment defined benefit plans are  recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).  Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment.    In respect of group   (iii)   Other long-term employee benefits       The Group’s obligation towards leave encashment,  service award scheme is determined using the  projected unit credit method, with actuarial  valuations being carried out at the end of each  annual reporting period. These obligations are  recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss.   (iv)   Short-term employee benefits       Short-term employee benefits such as salaries and  wages are recognised in the Consolidated Statement  of Profit and Loss, in the period in which the related  service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of  the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for  that service.   (v)   Loan to employees at concessional rate       Loans given to employees at concessional rate are  initially recognised at fair value and subsequently  measured at amortised cost. The difference between  the initial fair value of such loans and transaction  value is recognised as deferred employee cost upon  issuance of Loan, which is amortised on a straight- line basis over the expected remaining period of the  loan. In case of change in expected remaining period  of the loan, the unamortised deferred employee  cost on the date of change is amortised over the  updated expected remaining period of the loan on a  prospective basis.   In respect of RECL   (i)   Defined Contribution Plan        A defined contribution plan is a plan under which  the Company pays fixed contributions in respect of  the employees into a separate fund. The Company  has no legal or constructive obligations to pay  further contributions after its payment of the  fixed contribution. The contributions made by the  Company  towards  defined  contribution  plans  are  charged to the profit or loss in the period to which  the contributions relate.    (ii)   Defined benefit plan       The Company has an obligation towards gratuity,  Post Retirement Medical Facility (PRMF), Provident  Fund  (PF)  and  Other  Defined  Retirement  Benefit  (ODRB)  which  are  being  considered  as  defined  benefit plans covering eligible employees. Under the  defined benefit plans, the amount that an employee  will receive on retirement is defined by reference to  the employee's length of service, final salary, and  other defined parameters. The legal obligation for  any benefits remains with the Company, even if plan  assets for funding the defined benefit plan have been  set aside. The Company's obligation towards defined  benefit  plans  is  determined  using  the  projected  unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being  carried out at the end of each annual reporting  period. The liability recognised in the statement of  financial  position  for  defined  benefit  plans  is  the  present  value  of  the  Defined  Benefit  Obligation  (DBO) at the reporting date less the fair value of plan  assets. Management estimates the DBO annually  with the assistance of independent actuaries.       Actuarial gains/losses resulting from re- measurements of the liability/asset are included in  Other Comprehensive Income. 6.16 Material Prior Period Errors     Material prior period errors are corrected retrospectively  by restating the comparative amounts for the prior  periods presented in which the error occurred. If the  error occurred before the earliest period presented, the  opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the  earliest period presented, are restated. 6.17 Income Taxes     Income Tax expense comprises of current and deferred  tax. It is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss, except when it relates to an item that is recognised  in Consolidated Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or  directly in equity, in which case, tax is also recognised in  Consolidated OCI or directly in equity.   (i)   Current Tax       Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable  income for the year, using tax rates enacted or  substantively enacted and as applicable at the  reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable  in respect of earlier years.       Current  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  when  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off  the  recognised amounts and there is an intention to  settle the asset and liability on a net basis.   (ii)   Deferred Tax       Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences  between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the  corresponding tax bases used in the computation of  taxable income. Deferred tax is measured at the tax  rates based on the laws that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the reporting date, based  on the expected manner of realisation or settlement  of the carrying amount of assets / liabilities. Deferred  tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a  legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets  against liabilities, and they relate to income taxes  levied by the same tax authority.       A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable  temporary  differences.  A  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognised for all deductible temporary differences  to the extent that it is probable that future taxable  profits will be available against which the deductible  temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax  assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are  reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable  that the related tax benefit will be realised. 6.18 Earnings Per Share     Basic earnings per equity share are calculated by dividing  the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders  of the Group by the weighted average number of equity  shares outstanding during the financial year.     To calculate diluted earnings per share, the net profit or  loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders  and the weighted average number of shares outstanding  during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive  potential equity shares. 6.19 Expenditure on issue of shares     Expenditure on issue of shares is charged to the securities  premium account. 6.20    Dividends and Other Payments to holders  of Instruments classified as Equity     Final dividends are recorded as a liability on the date of  approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are  recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the  Board of Directors of the respective company in the Group.  390 391 390 391 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025     Liability for the payments to the holders of instruments  classified as equity are recognised in the period when such  payments are authorised for payment by the respective  company in the Group. 6.21    Business Combination under Common  Control     A business combination involving entities or businesses  under common control is a business combination in which  all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately  controlled by the same party or parties both before  and after the business combination and that control is  not transitory.     Business combinations involving entities or businesses  under common control are accounted for using the  pooling of interest method as follows:   •     The assets and liabilities of the combining entities  are reflected at their carrying amounts.   •     No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or  recognise new assets or liabilities. Adjustments are  made only to harmonise material accounting policies.   •     The  financial  information  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements in respect of prior periods is  restated as if the business combination has occurred  from the beginning of the preceding period in the  financial statements, irrespective of the actual date  of the combination.     The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the transferor is  aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in  the financial statements of the transferee. The identity  of the reserves is preserved and the reserves of the  transferor become the reserves of the transferee.     The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as  share capital issued plus any additional consideration in  the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share  capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve  and is presented separately from other capital reserves. 7.     USE OF ESTIMATES AND MANAGEMENT  JUDGEMENT     In preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  the Management is required to make judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and  the related disclosures. The estimates and underlying  assumptions are based on historical experience & other  relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.     Changes in accounting estimates, if any, are recognised  prospectively in the period in which the estimate is revised  if the revision affects only that period or in the period of  the revision and future periods if it affects both current  and future periods. 7.1   Significant Management Judgements     In order to enhance understanding of the Consolidated  Financial Statements, information about significant areas of  critical judgements, apart from those involving estimation  (Note no. 7.2), in applying accounting policies that have the  most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the  Consolidated Financial Statements, are as under:   (i)   Deferred Tax Liability on Special Reserve       The Company and its subsidiary RECL have obtained  resolution from their respective Board of Directors  that there is no intention to make withdrawal from  the Special Reserve created and maintained under  Section 36(1)(viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the  same cannot be withdrawn. Accordingly, no deferred  tax liability has been created on the said reserve.   (ii)     Non  recognition  of  income  on  Credit  Impaired Loan Assets       As a matter of prudence, income on credit impaired  loan assets is recognised as and when received or on  accrual basis either on resolutions of stressed assets  or when expected realisation is higher than the loan  amount outstanding.   (iii)    Amortisation  of  transaction  cost  on  Credit Impaired Loan Assets       Outstanding amount of unamortised transaction  cost is credited to Consolidated Statement of  Profit  and  Loss  on  classification  of  loan  asset  as  credit impaired.   (iv)   Classification of Investments        In order to classify an investment in a company as  investment in subsidiary or joint venture (JV) or  associate, judgement is required to assess the level of  control depending upon the facts and circumstances  of each case.   (a)     Energy  Efficiency  Services  Limited  (EESL)  was  incorporated in 2009 as a Joint Venture (JV) of NTPC  Ltd., Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL),  RECL  and  PFC.  During  the  financial  year  2022-23,  amendments in the JV agreement were made vide  Supplementary Agreement dated 01.09.2021, where  by the substantive participative rights and privileges  previously enjoyed by all the joint venture partners,  through  their  right  to  affirmative  vote  on  certain  reserved matters stands withdrawn. Therefore, in  absence of any joint control, EESL ceases to be a Joint  Venture Company for the purpose of consolidation  of financial statements.       The Company along with its subsidiary RECL is  holding  21.49  %  stake  in  equity  share  capital  of  Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL). However,  in the absence of any practical ability to direct the  relevant activities as per the requirements of Ind  AS 28 ‘Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures’,  the Group does not have any significant influence,  accordingly EESL has not been considered as an  associate company for the purpose of consolidation  of financial statements.   (b)    Ultra-Mega Power Projects (UMPPs), RECL’s  transmission projects (SPV) and PFCCL’s ITPs are  managed as per the mandate from Government of  India (GoI) and the Group does not have the practical  ability to direct their relevant activities unilaterally.  The Group therefore, considers its investment in  respective UMPPs, ITPs and SPVs as associates  having significant influence despite the respective  Companies holding 100% of their paid- up equity  share capital.   (c)     By virtue of holding Board position or equity stake  in borrower companies, the rights exercised by  PFC in such companies are protective in nature.  Thus, the borrower companies are not considered  as associates.   (v)   Low value leases       An assessment is required, if lessee opts not to apply  the recognition and measurement requirements of  Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ to leases where the underlying  asset is of low value. For the purpose of determining  low value, the Group has considered nature of  assets and concept of materiality as defined in Ind  AS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and  the conceptual framework of Ind AS which involve  significant judgement.   (vi)    Sundry  Liabilities-  Interest  Capitalisation       Unrealised income on credit impaired loans,  represented by Funded Interest Term Loan (FITL) /  debt / equity instruments acquired under resolution,  is transferred to a separate account titled ‘Sundry  Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalisation)’ and is  recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss on repayment of FITL or sale / redemption of  debt / equity instruments.   (vii)    Evaluation of indicators for impairment  loss allowance of financial assets       The evaluation of the applicability of indicators  for computation of impairment loss allowance of  assets requires assessment of several external and  internal factors which could result in deterioration of  recoverable amount of the assets. The Group makes  significant  judgement  in  identifying  the  default,  and significant increase in credit risk (SICR) as well  as  grouping  of  similar  financial  assets  based  on  available information.   (viii)    Deferred  tax  liability  /  deferred  tax  asset  in  respect  of  undistributed  profits/losses of subsidiaries, branches,  investments  in  associates  and  joint  ventures       Judgement is required in accounting for deferred  tax liability / deferred tax asset in respect of Group’s  investments  in  respect  of  undistributed  profits/ losses of subsidiaries, investments in associates  and joint ventures. In respect of undistributed  profits/losses of subsidiaries, investments in joint  ventures, the Company is able to control the timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary  differences  and  the temporary differences will not be reversed in  the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group does  not recognise a deferred tax liability for all taxable  temporary differences associated with investments  in subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures. 7.2     Assumptions and Key Sources of Estimation  Uncertainty      Information about estimates and assumptions that have  the significant effect on recognition and measurement of  assets, liabilities, income and expenses is provided below:   (i)   Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)        The Group’s estimate of the DBO is based on a  number of underlying assumptions such as standard  rates  of  inflation,  mortality,  discount  rate  and  anticipation of future salary increases. Variation in  these assumptions may significantly impact the DBO  amount and the annual defined benefit expenses as  detailed at Note 50.2.   (ii)     Impairment  test  of  Financial  Assets  (Expected Credit Loss)       The measurement of impairment loss allowance  for  financial  assets  which  includes  loan,  LoCs,  LoUs and guarantees measured at amortised cost  requires use of statistical models, expected future  392 393 392 393 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 economic  conditions,  estimated  cash  flows  and  credit behaviour (e.g., inputs and weights used for  credit risk scoring, likelihood of borrowers defaulting  and resulting losses). The cash flows expected to be  recovered from credit impaired loans are assessed  based on the borrower’s financial situation, current  status of the project, bid-value, resolution plan  amount, OTS amount as available.        As these estimates are based on various  assumptions, actual results may vary. Refer Note  46.1 for further details.   (iii)   Fair value measurement        Fair  value  of  financial  instruments  is  required  to  be estimated for financial reporting purposes. The  Group applies appropriate valuation techniques and  inputs for fair value measurements. In estimating  the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses  quoted prices and market-observable data to the  extent it is available. In case of non-availability of the  same, unobservable inputs are used for calculation  of fair value of the assets/ liabilities. The information  about the valuation techniques, inputs used in  determination of fair value of various assets &  liabilities and other details are disclosed at Note 48.   (iv)   Income Taxes       Estimates are involved in determining the provision  for income taxes, including amount expected to be  paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions and also  in respect of expected future profitability to assess  deferred tax asset. Refer Note 43 and 16 for details.   (v)     Useful  life  of  Property,  Plant  &  Equipment (PPE) and Intangible Assets       The Group reviews its estimate of the useful lives  of depreciable/amortisable assets at the end of  each financial year, based on the expected utility  of the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates  relate to technical and economic obsolescence that  may change the utility of assets. Refer Note 18 for  details on useful lives and carrying values of PPE and  Intangible assets. 8.

The claims of the holders of the PDI are:  (a)     Superior to the claims of the holders of the equity shares issued by the Company and perpetual non-cumulative preference  shares, if any, of the Company; and (b)     Subordinated to the claims of all other creditors of the Company (but pari-passu inter se the holders of the PDIs). The  Company may defer the payment of Coupon, if:   (i)     The capital to risk assets ratio (“CRAR”) of the Company is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed    by RBI; or   (ii)     the impact of such payment results in CRAR of the Company falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory  requirement prescribed by RBI. Further, it also has certain unique features which, inter-alia, grant PFC, in consultation  with RBI a discretion in terms of writing down the principal / interest, to skip interest payments, to make an early recall  etc. without commensurate right for investors to legal recourse, even if such actions might result in potential loss  to investors. As these securities are perpetual in nature and claim of PDI holders is subordinate to claim of all other  creditors and further as the Company does not have an unconditional right not to pay the coupon, these have been  classified under subordinated liabilities. 24.2 Details of Subordinated Debt (Unsecured) are as under: Sr.  No. Subordinated Bond Series Coupon Rate  (p.a.)

In accordance with the RBI Master  Direction in order to augment risk management practices in the respective Company, PFC and its subsidiary RECL has  respective Chief Risk Officers (CRO) who are involved in the process of identification, measurement and mitigation of risks.  The risk management approach i.e. objectives, polices and processes for identifying, measuring and managing each of above  risk is set out in the subsequent paragraphs. 46.1 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss to the Group by failing to discharge  its obligation. Details of financial assets that expose the Group to credit risk (gross carrying amount) are: ( H  in crore) Particulars As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Low Credit Risk Cash and cash equivalents (a)  319.22   339.34  Bank balances other than included in cash and cash equivalents (a)  9,265.73   3,049.22  Loans (Principal Outstanding) (c)  10,15,247.28   9,10,756.18  Trade and other receivables (b)  218.39   147.79  Investments (Excluding equity investments) (a)  9,198.67   7,236.77  Other financial assets (b)  30,064.25   29,855.31  Moderate Credit Risk Loans (Principal Outstanding) (c)  76,579.11   50,183.94  Trade receivables (b)  70.07   58.90  High Credit Risk Investments (Excluding equity investments) (a)  101.67   101.67  Loans (Principal Outstanding) (c)  18,169.50   29,883.55  Other financial assets (b)  178.80   89.25  Trade and other receivables (b)  89.10   58.55  (a)     Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances is limited as these are held with scheduled commercial public sector banks, high rated  private sector banks and mutual fund houses, across the country with diversified deposit base. The Companies in the Group diversify the deposit base  by deploying funds in various types of instruments with respective banks/ mutual fund houses.     Exposure to credit risk on investments is managed by diversifying the investment portfolio, periodically monitoring such investments, and applying the  appropriate valuation techniques to arrive at the carrying value. The Group carries an impairment loss allowance of  H   104.93 crore on its investments  as at 31.03.2025 (as at 31.03.2024  H   101.67 crore). (b)     Credit risk on trade receivables and other financial assets is mitigated by assessing the credit worthiness of debtors and is managed by monitoring the  recoverability of such amounts. The Group carries requisite impairment loss allowance on such trade receivables and other financial assets. (c)     The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily through its lending operations. The same is explained in the paragraphs below (Note 46.1.1 – Note 46.1.13). 46.1.1 Credit Risk Management Approach for lending operations A.   In respect of PFC     PFC has put in place key policies and processes for managing credit risk, which include formulating credit policies, guiding  the PFC’s appetite for credit risk exposures, undertaking reviews & objective assessment of credit risk, and monitoring  performance and management of portfolios. All the procedures and processes of the Company are ISO 9001:2015 certified.     The credit risk management covers two key areas, i.e., project appraisal & project monitoring. PFC selects the borrowers in  accordance with the PFC’s approved credit policy, which inter alia, defines factors to be considered for rating of the borrower/  project. PFC’s customer selection procedure assesses viability of project along with that of its promoting entity. Rate of  interest and maximum admissible exposure is, inter alia, based on internal rating awarded by PFC.   (i)   Appraisal of Projects     PFC follows a systematic, institutional project appraisal process to assess the credit risk before financing any project.     (a)   Appraisal for Private Sector Projects         For private sector projects, a two-stage appraisal process is followed. Initially a preliminary appraisal is carried  out in order to decide the prima facie preparedness of the project to be taken up for detailed appraisal. Detailed  appraisal is carried out for those projects shortlisted on the basis of preliminary appraisal.         PFC along with evaluation of project viability also assesses the ability of its promoter(s) to contribute equity and  complete the project. PFC follows an integrated rating methodology whereby Integrated Rating (IR) is calculated  using the weighted average of the scores of the project grading and promoter grading. Based on the IR of the  project, terms and conditions (including security package, interest rate and debt-equity ratio) are stipulated.     (b)   Appraisal for State Sector Projects         State sector projects are taken up for detailed appraisal to determine, inter-alia, if they are techno economically/ financially sound and compatible with integrated power development & expansion plans of the State.          PFC classifies state power generation utilities into various risk rating grades based on the evaluation of utility’s  performance  against  specific  parameters  covering  operational  and  financial  performance.  With  regards  to  transmission utilities, PFC adopts the categorisation of its subsidiary RECL as per its policy. With regard to State  Power Distribution utilities including integrated utilities, PFC’s categorisation policy provides for adoption of  Ministry of Power’s (MoP’s) Integrated Ratings by aligning such ratings/ grading with that of PFC’s rating structure.  The categorisation of Borrowers in the Logistics and Non-Power Infrastructure sector is carried out on the basis of  recommendations of the Internal Committee considering the strengths and weaknesses of the project.         Such categories/ ratings are used to determine security requirements and pricing of loans given to the State Sector  Borrowers. PFC also has a mechanism in place for monitoring the exposure to borrowers.         The detailed project appraisal involves technical and financial appraisal covering various aspects such as project  inputs,  statutory  and  non-statutory  clearances,  contracts,  implementation  plan,  project  linkages,  financial  modelling/ projections, calculation of returns, sensitivity analysis etc.         After detailed analysis indicated above, the overall viability of the project and entity is assessed and various  conditions in the form of pre-commitment, pre-disbursement and other conditions are stipulated so as to ensure  tying up of funds (debt and equity both), all physical inputs, appropriateness of all the contracts, compliance of  conditions precedent in agreements/ contracts/ statutory and non- statutory clearances related to the project etc.  and in general to ensure bankability of the project & protection of the interest of PFC as a lender for timely servicing  of debt. PFC has an authorisation/ delegation structure for the approval of credit facilities commensurating with  the size of the loan.   (ii)   Security and Covenants       PFC stipulates a package of security measures/covenants to mitigate risks during the construction and post COD  (commercial operation date) stage of the project. Based on the risk appetite and appraisal of the project, PFC adopts a  combination of the following measures: 452 453 452 453 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

For State sector projects, monitoring is being carried out on the basis of project progress details obtained regularly from  borrowers, site visits, discussions with the borrowers, information/reports available on Central Electricity Authority’s  (CEA) website etc.       For private sector, where PFC is Lead Financial Institution (FI), the Company engages Lenders’ Engineers (LEs)/ Project  Management Agency (PMA) (a single entity, thereby facilitating better coordination of project monitoring activities)/  Lenders’ Financial Advisors (LFAs), which are independent agencies to act on behalf of various lenders / consortium  members. The PMA / LEs conduct periodic site visits, review relevant documents, discusses with the borrowers and  submit its reports on progress of the project. LFAs submit the statements of fund flow and utilisation of funds in the  project periodically. In cases PFC is not the lead FI, the tasks related to PMA/ LEs and LFAs services are coordinated with  the concerned lead lender.       Also, the consolidated periodic progress report of certain projects is prepared comprising important observations/  issues viz. areas of concern, reasons for delay, issues affecting project construction/implementation etc. and is reviewed  by PFC on a regular basis.       PFC continuously monitors delays and/or default of borrowers and their recoverability. On occurrence of default in  the borrower’s account, PFC initiates necessary steps which may involve action(s) including, but not limited to, Special  Mention Account (SMA) reporting to RBI, credit information reporting to Central Repository of Information on Large  Credits (CRILC) etc., regularisation of the account by recovering all over dues, invocation of guarantees/ securities to  recover the dues, conversion of loan into equity as per loan agreement, restructuring of loan account, formulating  resolution plan with the borrower, change in ownership, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under IBC  -2016, sale of the exposures to other entities/investors, other recovery mechanisms like referring the case for legal action  before Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), SARFAESI, etc. and other actions as specified under regulatory/legal framework. B.   In respect of RECL     The credit risk is managed at different levels including at appraisal, disbursements and post disbursement monitoring.  RECL has “Integrated Rating Guidelines” and “Comprehensive Risk Management Policy”. To mitigate credit risk, RECL follows  systematic institutional and project appraisal process to assess the credit risk. These processes include a detailed appraisal  methodology, identification of risks and suitable structuring and credit risk mitigation measures. Further, on periodic basis,  the loan assets are reviewed and categorised as High/Moderate/Low based on ECL Methodology. The process for Credit Risk  Management is as under:   (i)     RECL has “Integrated Rating Guidelines” covering credit assessment, risk grading, collateral requirements, reporting,  monitoring of end utilisation of funds etc. Further, independent Lender legal counsels are appointed to ensure effective  documentation and mitigation of legal risk.   (ii)     For all existing private sector projects, where RECL is Lead Financial Institution, RECL engages Lender’s Independent  Engineers (LIE), Lender’s Financial Advisors (LFA) and Lender’s Insurance Advisors (LIA), which are independent agencies  who act on behalf of various lenders and consortium members. LIE conducts periodic site visits and submits reports  on progress status of the project, after discussion with borrower and inspection/ review of relevant documents. LFA  submit the statements of fund flow and utilisation of funds in the project periodically. In cases where RECL is not the  lead Financial Institution, the tasks related to LIE and LFA services are being coordinated with the lead lender.       RECL also endeavours to appoint a separate Project Management Agency (PMA) for new projects being financed, which  subsumes the entire works of LIE /Project Management Consultant (PMC), LFA and LIA for better coordination among  the agencies. PMA is stationed at project site to closely monitor various day to day project execution activities including  monitoring of project progress, review of EPC/non-EPC contracts & invoices, fund utilisation and insurance for the  project. PMA also verifies the bills of original equipment manufacturer/ supplier, composite works contractor and give  its recommendation for disbursement. Initial due diligence is also be performed by PMA taking the sanctity of technical  and financial parameters including original project cost & COD.       Concurrent Auditors/Agencies for Specialised monitoring/Cash Flow monitoring agencies are being appointed by REC/ Lenders on case to case basis for effective monitoring of Trust & Retention Account (TRA) for stressed projects.   (iii)     RECL has an authorisation structure for the approval and renewal of credit facilities. Authorisation limits have been  established commensurating with the size of business proposal at CMD/Executive Committee/Loan Committee/Board  of Directors based on the recommendation of Screening Committee, as appropriate.   (iv)     RECL has developed risk grading structure to categorise its exposures according to the degree of risk of default by  charging appropriate interest rates and security package.   (v)     Regular reports on the credit quality of loan portfolios are provided to Risk Management Committee and Board, which  may require appropriate corrective action to be taken.   (vi)     External agencies are appointed from time to time to review the guidelines, policy and existing practices being followed  by business units along with providing the specialist skills to promote best practice throughout RECL for management  of credit risk.   (vii)     Individual and Group Credit Exposures are assessed against designated limits, before facilities are committed to  borrowers by the business unit concerned. Sanction of additional facilities is also subject to the same review process.   (viii)    RECL continuously monitors delays and/ or default of borrowers & other counterparties and their recoverability. On  occurrence of default in the borrower’s account, RECL initiates necessary steps to cure the default which may involve  action(s) including, but not limited to, Special Mention Account (SMA) reporting to RBI, credit information reporting to  Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC), etc., monitoring of the TRA account, conversion of loan into  equity as per loan agreement, restructuring of loan account, formulating resolution plan with the borrower, change in  ownership, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), sale of the exposures to other entities/ investors and other  recovery mechanisms including invocation of guarantees/ securities to recover the dues. 46.1.2   Credit Risk Measurement - Impairment Assessment for Lending Operations       Ind-AS 109 outlines a three staged model for measurement of impairment based on changes in credit risk since initial  recognition. For classification of its borrowers into various stages, the Company uses the following basis:      -   A financial asset that is not credit impaired on initial recognition is classified in ‘Stage 1’.      -   If a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) is identified, the financial asset is moved to ‘Stage 2’.      -   If the financial asset is credit-impaired, it is moved to ‘Stage 3’ category. A   In respect of PFC     PFC recognises impairment loss allowance in accordance using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets  which are not categorised at fair value through profit or loss.   I.     Default:  In accordance with Ind AS 109, PFC considers the rebuttable presumption to define a financial asset as in  default, i.e. when the loan account is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments. Credit impaired financial  assets are aligned with the definition of default.   II.    SICR:  An assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed at each  reporting date by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial  instrument. In accordance with Ind AS 109, PFC has applied rebuttable presumption that considers more than 30 days  past due as a parameter for determining significant increase in credit risk. Further, in case of private sector borrowers,  other factors like downgradation in external credit rating to ‘C-’, restructuring resulting in asset downgradation as per  IRAC norms, delay in commissioning of project for more than 4 years are also considered. 454 455 454 455 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       In case of Stage 3 financial assets, after implementation of the resolution plan (except for change of ownership and/or  resolution through NCLT), the financial asset is upgraded and classified as Stage 2 for four quarters from the date of  implementation of resolution plan.   III.   Measurement of Expected Credit Loss (ECL)       PFC recognises impairment loss allowance for the financial assets in accordance with a board-approved expected credit  loss (ECL) policy. ECL is measured on either a 12 month or lifetime basis depending on whether there is significant  increase in credit risk since initial recognition. ECL is the product of Probability of default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD)  and Exposure at Default (EAD). PFC has appointed an independent agency, CRISIL Ltd., during the financial year for  assessment of ECL in accordance with Ind AS 109. The brief methodology of computation of ECL is as follows:     (i)   Probability of default (PD)         PD is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. It is estimated as at a point in time. For  assessing 12-month PD, probability of a loan defaulting in next 12 months is ascertained and similarly for assessing  lifetime PD, probability of a loan defaulting in its remaining lifetime is ascertained.       For Stage 1 accounts, 12 months PD is used.       For Stage 2 (significantly increased credit risk accounts), Lifetime PD is used.       For Stage 3 (credit impaired accounts), 100% PD is taken.         12-month PD: In case of State Sector borrowers, for the purpose of PD calculation, the risk rating grades of the  utilities are considered. For Gencos/Transcos/Others, PFC’s internal rating grades have been considered. For  Discoms / Power Department borrowers, PFC has adopted the MoP ratings. The ratings as above has been be  mapped with the standard external rating benchmarks. The PD factor associated with the mapped external rating  as given in the PD transition matrix published by various CRAs have been used for PD calculation.          In case of Private sector borrowers, the latest external rating as published by various Credit Rating Agencies have  been referred to compute PD using the PD transition matrix published by various CRAs. If external rating is not  available, the PD has been computed through Proxy Risk Scoring Model on a 10-point scale with 1 suggesting  minimum risk and 10 suggesting the highest risk. The said model uses the Quantitative financial ratios like Gearing  (Debt/Equity), Return on Capital Employed, Interest Coverage ratio, Debt to EBITDA ratio and qualitative factors  like PLF, ACS/ ARR ratio or LAF to arrive at the final Risk score. The financial risk score obtained have been mapped  to external rating benchmarks. This mapped rating has been referred to compute PD associated with the rating  using the PD transition matrix published by various CRAs.       For Lifetime PD: Markov Chain Model has been used to compute Lifetime PDs of the rating grade.     (ii)   Loss Given Default (LGD)       LGD is the loss factor which PFC may experience in case the default occurs.         For State sector borrowers, the exposure is bifurcated into guaranteed and non guaranteed portion. Flat LGD  has been applied to the exposure amount which is guaranteed by the State. For non guaranteed portion, PFC  considers the credit worthiness of the states on various parameters while estimating the LGD. For estimating the  credit worthiness of the state, parameters like State GDP per capita, Fiscal deficit/GDP ratio, Proportion of infra  and developmental expenditure and Proportion on Revenue Expenditure on Energy Sector, etc. are used as key  inputs. The state utilities are bifurcated into Low, Medium and High-risk category based on the state category.  Moreover, for non-guaranteed portfolio of State Sector borrowers, additional stress factors have been considered  in the estimation of LGD based on their respective rating groups to account for the likelihood of default owing to  borrower’s adverse financial conditions or inability to repay.Thus, PFC derives the realisable value of the assets  by considering stress factor(s) based on financial health of the state and rating of the borrower. In case of Private  sector borrowers, LGD has been assessed considering various factors related to the project to arrive at realisable  value of the plant such as generation capacity, project cost per MW, percentage completion of the plant, and book  value of the assets, cost incurred and other relevant information. A stress factor was also applied as a haircut to  arrive at the realisable value.         For Stage 3 borrowers, LGD has been assessed project wise based on Bid value/resolution plan amount/OTS  amount/any other value/ discounted cash flows etc. as applicable.     (iii)   Exposure at Default (EAD)         Exposure at Default is the outstanding exposure on which ECL is computed. EAD includes outstanding principal  and interest accrued and interest overdues on financial assets that PFC expects to be owed in the event of default  in respect of the loan. As per Note 7.1.(ii), income on credit impaired assets is recognised as and when received or  on accrual basis when expected realisation is higher than the loan amount outstanding, therefore, the same is not  used in computation of Exposure at default.     (iv)   Key assumptions used in measurement of ECL        -     The Company considers the date of initial recognition as the base date from which significant increase in  credit risk is determined.       -     Since the Company has a right to cancel any sanctioned but undrawn limits to any of its borrowers, EAD is  assumed to be outstanding balance and interest of the loan as on the reporting date.    (v)     The calculation of ECL incorporates forward-looking information. Further, the independent agency appointed to  assist the Company in ECL assessment also consider the forward-looking information in the determination of the  impairment allowance to be assigned to the borrower, by taking into consideration various project operational  parameters, project financial ratios, extension of the project completion and also possibility of stressed and  favourable economic conditions. Further, the independent agency has also added some additional macroeconomic  parameters such as IIP (index of industrial production) electricity y-o-y growth rate, Money supply y-o-y growth  rate to arrive at a weighted shock factor to the base PD term structure for ECL computation so as to reflect the  right risk assessment of the utilities. B.   In respect of RECL      The impairment loss allowance on loan assets is provided as per Ind AS 109 in accordance with a board- approved policy, which  measures the credit risk on the basis of key financial and operational parameters to assess improvement/ deterioration in  credit quality. Management overlays to the model output, if any, are duly documented and approved by the Audit Committee.  The evaluation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is undertaken by an independent agency, ICRA Analytics Limited (formerly ICRA  Online Limited).   I.     RECL has an internal system of grading for State Governments, Public Sector Undertakings and State Power Utilities.  However, for State Distribution Companies (DISCOMs), RECL adopts the ratings by the Ministry of Power as and when  they are updated. These ratings are mapped with external rating grades published by various credit rating agencies  as part of rating transition matrix. For private borrowers, RECL uses the external rating as published by various  credit rating agencies or proxy risk scores in case such rating is not available. The proxy risk score model considers  following parameters:     >>   Quantitative factors       -   Debt/ EBITDA (30% weightage)       -   Return on Capital Employed (15% weightage)       -   Interest Coverage (25% weightage)       -   Gearing (Debt/Equity) (30% weightage)     >>   Qualitative Factors       -   Quarter wise Operational Parameters like PPA, PLF, ACS – ARR Gap, LAF, LUF, etc     -   Actual  Default  dates       -   Status of the Project 456 457 456 457 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   II.   Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)     RECL considers a financial instrument to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk in following cases:     i.   When on any financial instrument if the payment is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments,     ii.   Stage 1 loan asset is undergoing restructuring, untill one year of regular payments as per restructuring plan,     iii.   Downgrade in the credit rating of borrower to “C”,     iv.   Delay in the date of commencement of commercial operation of project by more than 4 years.   III.   Definition of default and credit-impaired assets       RECL defines a financial instrument as in default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired, when the  loan account is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments or any such period allowed by RECL in line with  circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India.   IV.   Measuring ECL - explanation of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques       Expected credit losses are the product of the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default  (LGD), defined as follows:     -     PD represents the likelihood of the borrower defaulting on its obligation either over next 12 months or over the  remaining lifetime of the instrument.     -     EAD represents the amounts, including the principal outstanding, interest accrued and outstanding Letters of  Comfort that RECL expects to be owed at the time of default.     -     LGD represents RECL’s expectation of loss given that a default occurs. LGD is expressed in percentage and it shows  the proportion of the amount that will actually be lost post recoveries in case of a default.   V.   Determination of Probability of Default (PD)       RECL has analysed the available annual rating transition matrix published by credit rating agencies to arrive at annual  transition matrix based PD. This annual transition matrix PD was extrapolated to arrive at the lifetime probability  of default of various rating grades by loan tenure / maturity profile i.e. lifetime PD. However, for State Distribution  Companies (DISCOMs), the Company adopts the ratings by the Ministry of Power as and when they are updated.   VI.   Loss Given Default (LGD) computation model       Based on the historical trend, research and industry benchmarking, RECL has constructed a LGD model. Factors  reviewed in the LGD model include Project cost per unit, PPA status, FSA status etc. Based on internal research RECL has  benchmarked these factors for Thermal, Renewable in Private Sector. In case of Private sector borrowers, the realisable  value of the assets were arrived at using suitable assumptions, including valuation reports carried out by RECL, outcome  of the resolution process etc., to arrive at LGD. For State Government and Public sector projects, RECL has factored in  the state support and assumed that the State/Central governments would step in to repay debt obligations of the state  utilities as witnessed in the past.   VII.   Key assumptions used in measurement of ECL     a)     RECL considers the date of initial recognition as the base date from which significant increase in credit risk  is determined.     b)     EAD represents the amounts, including the principal outstanding, interest accrued and outstanding Letters of  Comfort that RECL expects to be owed at the time of default.   VIII. Collateral and other credit enhancements       RECL employs a range of policies and practices to mitigate credit risk. The most common of these is accepting collateral  for funds disbursed. RECL has internal policies on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral or credit risk mitigation.  The principal collateral types for loans and advances are:     -   Mortgage of Immovable properties     -   Hypothecation of Moveable property     -   Assignment of project contract documents     -   Pledge of instruments through which promoters’ contribution is infused in the project     -   Pledge of Promoter Shareholding     -   Corporate and personal Guarantee of Promoters 46.1.3 Credit risk analysis for Lending operations exposure to credit risk     For loans recognised in the balance sheet, the gross exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount. Refer Note 12  ‘Loans’ for Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from loans.     For financial guarantee issued, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount that the Group would have to  pay if the guarantees are called upon. For irrevocable loan commitments, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full  amount of the commitment facilities. Refer Note 52 for exposure of Guarantee and Outstanding Disbursement Commitments. A.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 46.1.4 Concentration of credit risk Credit concentration risk refers to risk associated with large credit/investment exposure to a single company or a group of  companies based on its ownership, sector, region etc. that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly  affected by changes in economic or other conditions, with the potential to adversely affect lender’s core operations. The following table sets out an analysis of risk concentration of overall loan portfolio of PFC and its subsidiary, RECL on the basis  of similar risk characteristics: ( I  in crore) Particulars As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Principal  outstanding Impairment loss  allowance* Principal  outstanding Impairment loss  allowance* Concentration by ownership Loans to state sector (i.e., entities under the control of state    and /or central government)  9,15,119.35   9,587.15   8,44,163.65   5,657.78  Loans to private sector  1,94,876.54   15,643.82   1,46,660.02   22,626.03  Total  11,09,995.89   25,230.97   9,90,823.67   28,283.81  *Including impairment loss allowance on Letter of Comfort & Letter of Undertaking of  H   69.19 crore (as at 31.03.2024  H   80.65 crore). Loans to state sector are well diversified as these are extended to multiple entities under the control of various State Governments  and Central Government. The Companies considers that these loans have a low credit risk in comparison to lending to private  sector mainly due to low default / loss history in state sector and availability of government guarantee in certain loans.

In respect of PFCCL     The trade receivables of PFCCL comprises mainly amount recoverable from the State Government entities. PFCCL considers  that the exposure to state sector have a low credit risk mainly due to low default/ loss history. Further, the presence of  Government interest lowers the risk of non-recoverability.     Subsequent to initial recognition, PFCCL recognises expected credit loss (ECL) on financial assets especially on trade  receivables other than related parties. ECL is recognised at 100% on the trade receivables due for more than 2 years and  50% on the trade receivables due for more than one year and less than 2 years.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 46.3.2 Foreign currency risk monitoring and management     PFC & RECL have their respective Board approved risk management policies to manage risks associated with foreign currency  borrowings. These policies prescribe appropriate systems and controls to identify, measure and monitor the foreign currency  risks through committees comprising of senior level officials. Derivative transactions are done to cover exchange/interest  rate risks through various instruments like foreign currency forwards contracts, currency options, principal only swaps,  and IRS and forward rate agreements. These derivative transactions are done for hedging purpose and not for trading or  speculative purpose. 46.3.3 Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis     The table below represents the impact on Group’s total equity ((Gain / (Loss)) for 5% change in foreign currency exchange rate  against INR on unhedged portfolio of outstanding foreign currency borrowings: ( I  in crore) Foreign Currency Liabilities As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Decrease Increase Decrease Increase USD  24.77   (24.77)  290.55   (252.13) EURO  137.23   (137.23)  174.06   (172.28) JPY  79.24   (79.24)  10.04   (10.04) GBP  -   -   -   -  SGD  -   -   -   -  Total  241.24   (241.24)  474.65   (434.45) 46.4 Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk     Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest  rates. Interest rates are dynamic and dependent on various internal and external factors including but not limited to RBI  policy changes, liquidity in the market, movement of external benchmarks such as AAA bond / G-Sec yields / LIBOR etc. The  impact may be beneficial or adverse depending on the direction of change in interest rates and whether assets or liabilities  re-price faster. A.   In respect of PFC   (i)     Interest rate risk is managed with the objective to control market risk exposure while  optimising the return.       The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) tracks the interest rate risk through the gap analysis i.e. by analysing the  mismatches between Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities. For gap analysis, the interest rate sensitivity  statement prescribed by RBI is used, wherein the gap is measured between the Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive  Liabilities which are distributed based on the maturity date or the re-pricing date whichever is earlier.       Further, for managing the interest rate risk, the Company reviews its interest rates periodically based on prevailing  market conditions, borrowing cost, yield, spread, competitors’ rates, etc. The asset mix is managed by the Company  through its interest rate & credit policies which inter-alia covers aspects like reset periods; repayment periods,  prepayment premium etc. The liabilities are managed keeping in view factors like cost, market appetite, timing, market  scenario, ALM gap position etc. The Company also enters into various derivatives transactions like interest rate swaps,  cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk.     The exposure of the PFC’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are: ( H  in crore) Particulars As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Fixed Rate Borrowings  3,02,058.41   3,02,902.78  Floating Rate Borrowings  1,63,704.67   1,04,480.54  Total Borrowings  4,65,763.08   4,07,383.32    (ii)     Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis       As per RBI Guidelines, Earning at Risk (EaR) is an important focal point for interest risk management. For interest rate  sensitivity analysis, the impact of movement of interest rates has been measured on the Earning at Risk derived from  the gap statements. The impact has been worked out considering 25 basis upward/downward shock to interest rates  over a one-year period, assuming a constant balance sheet. The analysis shows that if rates are increased/decreased by  25 bps, the impact on EaR will be (+/-)  H   213.56 crore. (As at 31.03.2024 (+/-)  H   315.68 crore).       The analysis assumes that the Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities are being re-priced at the same time.  Further, the analysis considers the earliest/first re-pricing date of the Rate Sensitive Assets and Rate Sensitive Liabilities.       Note: A 25 basis point increase or decrease represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in  interest rates.   (iii)   Disclosures in respect of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform       The Company has successfully completed its transition from LIBOR to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs), such as  the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONA), in line with applicable  transitional provisions.     Accordingly, the loan agreements and derivatives are now referenced to these alternative benchmarks. B.   In respect of RECL   (i)     RECL’s borrowings are exposed to interest rate risk with floating interest rates linked to external benchmarks such as  EURIBOR, Overnight SOFR, Term SOFR, SORA, TONA, T-Bills, Repo Rate etc. RECL manages its interest rate risk through  various derivative contracts like interest rate swap contracts, forward interest rate contracts to minimise the risk of  fluctuation in interest rates. RECL also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps as a cost-reduction strategy to benefit  from the interest differentials in different currencies.       The table below shows the overall exposure of RECL to the liabilities linked with floating interest rates as at 31.03.2025  is as under: (Foreign Currency & INR Equivalent in  I  crore) Currency As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Floating Interest  Rate Exposure Hedged through  Derivatives Unhedged  Exposure Floating Interest  Rate Exposure Hedged through  Derivatives Unhedged  Exposure INR Borrowings   44,379.47   -   44,379.47   61,162.28   -   61,162.28  USD $   8,166.15   7,533.40   632.75   561.11   521.80   39.32  INR Equivalent   69,887.05   64,471.86   5,415.19   46,782.38   43,504.51   3,277.87  JPY ¥   4,85,390.31   4,51,161.24   34,229.07   27,320.68   -   27,320.68  INR Equivalent   27,545.90   25,603.40   1,942.50   15,050.96   -   15,050.96  EURO €   604.02   -   604.02   60.40   -   60.40  INR Equivalent   5,576.63   -   5,576.63   5,449.37   -   5,449.37  SGD $   213.21   -   213.21   28.53   7.21   21.32  INR Equivalent   1,358.36   -   1,358.36   1,761.13   444.93   1,316.20  Total INR Equivalent  1,48,747.41   90,075.26   58,672.15   1,30,206.12   43,949.44   86,256.68        RECL also uses Interest Rate Swaps to manage fair value risk on interest rate borrowings to mitigate the interest rate  sensitivity mismatch. Through such swaps, the fixed rate borrowings amounting to  H   13,955.70 crore as on 31 st  March  2025 (Previous year  H   15,950.70 crores) have been converted into floating rate borrowings through the use of MIBOR-  linked Overnight Indexed Swaps.       RECL’s lending portfolio carries interest at semi-fixed rate i.e. fixed rate of interest with 1/3/6/12/36/30/120 months reset  option with the borrower. RECL reviews its lending rates periodically based on prevailing market conditions, borrowing  cost, yield, spread, competitors’ rates, sanctions and disbursements etc. In order to manage pre-payment risks, RECL  charges pre-payment premium from borrowers in case of pre- payment of loan. The interest rate risk is managed by  the analysis of interest rate sensitivity gap statements and by evaluating the creation of assets and liabilities with a mix  of fixed and floating interest rates. 470 471 470 471 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING     The hedging instruments which meets the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedge. The  effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  in Other Comprehensive Income. The change in intrinsic value of hedging instruments is recognised in ‘Effective Portion of  Cash Flow Hedges’. The amounts recognised in such reserve are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss  when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Further, the change in fair value of the time value of a hedging instruments  is recognised in ‘Cost of Hedging Reserve’.

In respect of RECL     Hedge ineffectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness  assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. RECL applies  the following effectiveness testing strategies:   (i)     For cross currency swaps, principal only swaps and interest rate swaps that exactly match the terms of the hedged  item, the economic relationship and hedge effectiveness are based on the qualitative factors using critical terms  match method.   (ii)     For other interest rate swaps (in cases of late designation), the Company uses dollar offset method using a hypothetical  derivatives, dollar offset method is a quantitative method that consists of comparing the change in fair value or cash  flows of the hedging instrument with the change in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the  hedged risk.   (iii)     For option structures, RECL analyses the behaviour of the hedging instrument and hedged item using regression  analysis based dollar offset method.

The liability for PRMS is recognised on the  basis of actuarial valuation.  This scheme is managed by a separate trust. The trust has to ensure adequate corpus for meeting the medical expenditure  incurred by the eligible employees/family members. However, any short fall has to be compensated by the Companies in the  Group. Based on acturial valuation, it is estimated that no liability will arise in this regard in the near future and hence, no further  provision is considered necessary.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 50.2.5 Risk exposure Through its defined benefit plans, the Companies in the Group are exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are  detailed below: i)   Investment risk/ Asset Volatility Risk     Most of the plan asset investments are in government securities, other fixed income securities with high rating grades and  mutual funds. The fair value of these assets is subject to volatility due to change in interest rates and other market & macro- economic factors. There is also a risk of asset liability mismatch i.e. the cashflow for plan assets does not match with cashflow  for plan liabilities. ii)   Changes in discount rate     The present value of defined benefit plan liabilities is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to  government bonds’ yields at the end of the reporting period. A decrease (increase) in discount rate will increase (decrease)  present values of plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ investments. iii)     Mortality rate risk /Longevity Risk     The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan  participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase  the plan’s liability. iv)   Salary escalation risk     The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As  such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. v)   Employee Turnover Rate /Withdrawal Rate      If the actual employee withdrawal rate in the future turns out to be more or less than expected then it may result in increase/ decrease in the liability. 50.2.6 Plan Assets The value of plan assets for each category is as follows:  ( I  in crore) Particulars As at 31.03.2025 As at 31.03.2024 Provident Fund  Gratuity  PRMS Provident Fund  Gratuity  PRMS Cash & Cash Equivalents  8.57   0.44   4.51   2.08   0.17   5.01  State/ Central Government Debt Securities  409.30   27.18   87.98   397.34   27.03   82.43  Corporate Bonds/ Debentures  277.83   21.54   195.05   268.23   21.43   173.97  Others  44.47   6.55   1.18   37.54   8.51   -  Total  740.17   55.72   288.72   705.19   57.14   261.41  Actual return on plan assets is  H   83.36 crore (previous year  H   79.40 crore). 50.2.7 Significant actuarial assumptions The most recent actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out as  at 31.03.2025 by TransValue Consultants for Companies in the Group.

The Group actively monitors how the duration and expected yield of investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising  from employee benefit obligations. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have  a material impact on overall level of assets. There has been no change in the process used by the Group to manage its risks from  prior periods. 488 489 488 489 Financial Statements Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Power Finance Corporation Ltd. 39 th  Annual Report 2024-25 Future-Focused.
