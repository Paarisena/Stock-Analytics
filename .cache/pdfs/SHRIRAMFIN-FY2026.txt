Trust that Delivers   Growth that Endures At Shriram Finance, trust is more than a  concept; it is the very foundation upon which  we stand. Over decades, we have built a legacy  marked by resilience, consistency, and the  creation of lasting value. Our growth is not  about chasing fleeting triumphs but about  cultivating stability, embracing responsibility,  and committing wholeheartedly to those  we serve. Through every market cycle and  economic shift, we have remained devoted,  empowering millions with financial solutions  that inspire confidence and security. This enduring philosophy of trust and  perseverance finds a powerful reflection in the  world of cricket, where few names command  as much respect as Rahul Dravid. Revered as  ‘Mr. Dependable,’ Dravid’s success was never  about dramatic flair or shortcuts. It was defined  by quiet yet formidable qualities-patience,  precision, and purpose, the unshakeable  ability to rise to the occasion when it mattered  most and deliver, time after time. His legacy,  founded on trust and reliability, embodies the  same values that have long defined Shriram  Finance. Much like Dravid, who stood firm at the  crease, we too have remained steady, delivering  reliable and consistent performance year after  year. This enduring commitment is captured  in this year’s theme:  Trust that Delivers,  Growth that Endures.  In a world of  constant change and unpredictability, Shriram  Finance continues to strengthen its leadership,  refine its asset portfolio, and create sustainable  value for every stakeholder. With the trust we  have earned, we empower millions to dream  without limits, plan with foresight, and achieve  progress that stands the test of time. The message of our  #TogetherWeSoar   campaign further amplifies this spirit of  partnership. By fostering long-lasting  relationships with our customers, we guide  them through life’s challenges, helping them  navigate uncertainty with confidence and  realise their aspirations. Just as Dravid’s steady  innings anchored his team to victory, Shriram  Finance’s consistent growth builds trust,  secures futures, and fuels the ambition for all  that lies ahead. With Trust that Delivers and Growth  that Endures, we are not merely  shaping the future of Shriram Finance.  We are empowering millions to take  charge of their lives and build the  future they envision, with their belief  fuelling our journey and their progress  shaping our legacy.

Dear Stakeholders, With immense pride and gratitude, I  present the 46 th  Annual Report of the  Company for FY 2024-25. This year’s  theme, “Trust that Delivers, Growth  that Endures,” captures the essence of  who we are and what we stand for.  Your unwavering trust has been the  foundation of our strength and success.  It inspires us to deliver consistent  performance, drive growth, and create  long-term value for all stakeholders. FY 2024–25 was a year that reaffirmed  the resilience of our business model and  the trust placed in us by our stakeholders.  In a fast-changing NBFC landscape,  Shriram Finance remained focused  and responsive, adapting to emerging  challenges with a clear sense of direction. We continued to extend financial services  to a wide and diverse customer base,  staying aligned with our long-standing  commitment to financial inclusion.  Our commitment to  empowering individuals  and businesses through  tailored financial  solutions has enabled  us to make meaningful  contributions to  the economic fabric  of our nation.  Chairman’s   Statement Management Message 20 Annu al Report 2024-25 

to serve as a vital enabler of financial  inclusion and economic upliftment,  especially for underserved communities. Financial and Operational  Performance in FY 2024-25 We delivered strong and consistent  performance throughout the fiscal year.  Our financial results remained robust  across all key metrics, underlining our  disciplined execution and sharp focus on  sustainable growth. This was evident in the  substantial rise in net profit, which reached  Rs. 9,761 crores in FY 2024-25 from Rs.  7,190 crores in FY 2023-24. Our Assets  Under Management (AUM) also saw  significant growth, touching Rs. 2,63,190  crores, a year-on-year increase of 17.05%. Further, our Company’s asset quality  demonstrated a marked improvement,  with the Gross Non-Performing Assets  (GNPA) ratio reducing to 4.55% in FY  2024-25 from 5.45% in the previous  fiscal year and Net Non-Performing  Assets (NNPA) ratio reducing to 2.64%  in FY 2024-25 from 2.70% in the  previous fiscal year. These achievements  reflect our ability to navigate market  uncertainties, uphold asset quality and  sustain consistent, profitable growth. Key Developments During the Year FY 2024-25 marked a transformative  chapter for our Company. It was shaped  by strategic decisions and purposeful  action that strengthened our leadership  and created enduring value. As part of  our portfolio optimisation strategy, we  completed the successful divestment  of our stake in Shriram Housing  Finance, now known as Truhome  Finance. This strategic exit unlocked  a one-time gain of Rs. 1,489 crores.  To enhance shareholders’ value, we  declared substantial interim dividends,  including 220% in Q2 and 125% in  Q3. To increase market liquidity, sub- division/split of face value of share into  5:1 was facilitated. This move aims to  make our shares more accessible and  encourage wider investor participation. Furthering our commitment to sustainable  growth, we brought all green financing  efforts under Shriram Green Finance, with  a focussed ambition to build an AUM of  Rs. 5,000 crores over the next 3-4 years.  Additionally, our efforts into electric  vehicle financing and sustainable mobility  solutions reflect our role in enabling India’s  transition to a cleaner, greener future.  To strengthen our brand’s visibility  and deepen trust, we appointed  cricketing legend Rahul Dravid as our  brand ambassador. His association  with Shriram Finance personifies our  integrity, reliability, and performance.  We also launched impactful brand  campaigns, which improved customer  engagement and further solidified our  position as a trusted financial partner. In parallel, we continued to strengthen our  operational excellence through innovation,  digital transformation and strong risk  practices. These efforts have helped us  fortify our leadership in vehicle financing. Outlook As we step into FY 2025-26, we hold fast to  our belief: Trust that Delivers, Growth that  Endures. In an environment marked by  regulatory shifts and global uncertainties,  we are dedicated to strengthening the trust  we have built over decades and steering  towards sustainable, responsible growth. Furthermore, we are committed to  maintaining our asset quality through  prudent risk practices and expanding our  digital strengths to enhance customer  experience. We are also deepening our  efforts in green financing to support  India’s march towards a cleaner future. The trust reposed in us by our customers,  employees, partners, and shareholders  continues to guide our journey. It  encourages thoughtful decisions, supports  meaningful progress, and deepens our  commitment to the communities we  serve. As we move forward, we do so with  a long-term vision, delivering consistent  value and ensuring that the growth we  foster is both inclusive and enduring. With the continued belief and support  of our stakeholders, we are confident  our Company will remain a beacon  of resilience, reliability and growth  that stands the test of time . With regards, Jugal Kishore Mohapatra   Chairman Our approach remained rooted in  prudence, with every decision guided  by the values and principles that define  us. As we move forward, our focus  stays on delivering stable, long-term  growth that creates value for all. Macro Overview In 2024, the global economy experienced  moderate growth, with the IMF projecting  a 3.2% increase in global GDP. This  was further led by a slight rebound in  advanced economies and a measured  slowdown in emerging markets. Amid  global uncertainties, our nation has  displayed remarkable endurance,  maintaining its position as one of the  fastest-growing major economies.  With a GDP growth of 6.5% for     FY 2024-25, India’s strong domestic  demand and effective policy  measures have played a crucial role  in sustaining economic momentum.  This solid performance highlights  India’s ability to navigate global  challenges while continuing to drive  inclusive and sustainable growth. India’s financial sector echoed this  strength, particularly the NBFC segment,  which witnessed significant developments  during FY 2024-25. After a period of  solid double-digit expansion, the sector  is transitioning towards sustainable  expansion, with AUM growth anticipated  to moderate to 15-17% over the next fiscal  years. In response, the Reserve Bank of  India (RBI) sharpened regulatory oversight  through the Scale-Based Regulation (SBR)  framework. This change has enhanced  governance and monitoring, especially  for systemically important NBFCs. As of December 2024, the Gross Non- Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio  for NBFCs was recorded at 2.53%, a  marked improvement from 2.70% in  December 2023. This progress reflected  enhanced asset quality and effective risk  management practices within the sector.  However, challenges remain, particularly  in unsecured lending, where rising  defaults among over-leveraged borrowers  warrant cautious optimism. Countering  this, regulatory interventions by the RBI  are steering the sector towards more  responsible growth strategies. Despite  these pressures, our sector continues  21 Shriram Finance Limited MANAGEMENT MESSAGE

Landscape that Guides Our Course India’s NBFC sector is undergoing  rapid change, shaped by surging  credit demand, stricter rules, and  rising capital costs. Our Company is  navigating this shifting environment  head-on, backed by a broad  portfolio and strong regional roots.  By embracing digital innovation,  optimising funding, and maintaining  our asset quality, we stay poised for  sustainable growth in an ever-evolving  sector. Key Sector  Increased Costs of Funds  (CoF)   Regulatory updates such as increased risk weights  for NBFC borrowing have raised the CoF for these  entities. Many NBFCs are addressing this challenge  by repricing products and prioritising high-yield  segments to offset the impact. (Source: chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/ https://images.assettype.com/bloombergquint/2024-01/ edcd3b09-52fa-45f6-8654-e783bd71dec0/Centrum_Shriram_ Finance_Ltd__Q3_FY24_Result_Review.pdf) Accelerated Digital  Transformation    The integration of digital solutions and collaborations with  fintech companies are increasing operational efficiency  and broadening customer outreach. Consequently, NBFCs  are prioritising the effective use of advanced analytics and  technology adoption to drive innovation and scalability.

This momentum stems from segments like vehicle  financing, MSMEs, and personal loans, supported  by deeper penetration into urban and rural markets.  (Source: chrome-extension:// efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://web-assets.bcg.co m/86/82/9b11253b481585f8fff6dbf966ab/2024-june-nbfc- sector-roundup-upload.pdf) Enhanced Regulatory  Oversight   The RBI has tightened regulations for NBFCs  by introducing measures like risk-based capital  requirements and stricter asset quality monitoring.  These changes align NBFC regulations more closely  with those for banks, reinforcing sector stability. Strengthened Asset Quality   The sector has improved its non-performing asset  (NPA) levels, and credit costs are stabilising around  2%, reflecting enhanced risk management practices. Operating Environment 28 Annual Report 2024-25 

SFL’s Strategic  We have strategically adapted to these trends, capitalising on  our established position as one of the leading NBFCs. Diversified Portfolio Expansion Vehicle finance, personal loans, and gold loans have  witnessed solid growth, with gold loan offerings  now accessible in over 1,000 branches.

These initiatives help cut turnaround  times, improve operational efficiency  and broaden access to credit, further  strengthening our Company’s market  position.  Strengthened Risk and Asset  Quality We have tightened our provisioning and  write-off strategies, effectively managing  credit costs and minimising the NPA levels.  These improvements have helped us maintain  financial stability and ensure our ability  to weather economic fluctuations, while  enhancing our asset quality. Optimised Cost  Structures  We have responded to rising fund  costs by shifting focus to high-yield,  products, while also optimising our  funding mix through international  borrowing. This approach helps us  mitigate the impact of higher CoF  and support the maintenance of net  interest margins 8.55%. Our proactive  pricing adjustments further contribute  to sustaining profitability, while  adapting to the changing financial  arena. 29 Shriram Finance Limited OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

Our approach to credit profile  management goes beyond conventional  methods. By integrating data,  technology, and customer insights, we  make well-informed lending decisions.  This framework helps us address the  varied needs of individuals, MSMEs,  and larger businesses. Parallelly, we maintain a balance  between risk management and  inclusion, allowing us to extend credit  responsibly while supporting customer  growth and ensuring financial  discipline. Decisions that Balance Risk and Reach Responsible Lending for  Sustainable Growth We anchor our lending practices in responsibility and  long-term sustainability. Every borrower’s financial  health and repayment ability is assessed with great care.  Moreover, our risk-based pricing considers a broad  range of factors including credit scores, income stability  and debt-to-income ratios. This ensures all loans are  priced fairly and transparently, advancing financial  inclusion and helping us maintain strong asset quality. Robust Credit Assessment  and Risk Mitigation At Shriram Finance, the risk assessment process begins  with rigorous due diligence for every borrower. By  using both internal and external credit scores, we  ensure that our lending decisions are well-informed.  In most cases, we lend to existing customers or to  those guaranteed by our current clients. This helps us  strengthen our credit controls and reduce exposure  to risk. We also conduct segment-wise stress testing,  supported by one of the Big Four accounting firms, to  enhance our risk management practices. Smarter Credit Decisions  through AI and ML Technology plays a vital role in strengthening our  credit profiling and underwriting processes. AI- powered scoring models analyse large volumes of  data to identify borrower patterns and behavioural  anomalies. At the same time, machine learning  algorithms enable us to carry out predictive  risk assessments. Additionally, our automated  underwriting processes streamline document  analysis and fraud detection, ensuring speed without  compromising on diligence.

Encouraging Cleaner Mobility Through  Lending Practices    We are aligning our lending strategy with environmental  sustainability by promoting the adoption of cleaner, more  efficient vehicles. We do not finance older vehicles with  higher emissions. Further, we employ differentiated loan- to-value and margin practices to incentivise customers to  operate newer, lower-emission vehicles. Additionally, SFL is  actively exploring opportunities to finance electric vehicles  (EVs)  charging infrastructure, renewable energy projects  and other Green assets. Thus, reinforcing our commitment  to supporting the transition toward greener mobility  solutions. We recognize the growing momentum of Electric  Vehicles (EVs) in India as a critical solution to mitigate  climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.  Acknowledging their transformative potential in shaping  the future of mobility, we have taken proactive steps to  support the transition by offering dedicated financial  solutions for EVs. Our efforts are aligned with India’s broader vision for  sustainable economic growth. By facilitating access to  EV financing, we aim to accelerate their adoption and  contribute meaningfully to the development of a low-carbon  transportation ecosystem While the EV industry is still evolving, we have proactively  launched initiatives to promote cleaner mobility financing.  We run targeted campaigns offering longer tenors and  concessional interest rates for electric vehicles, particularly  in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler segments. These segments align with our focus on first-time borrowers  and last-mile operators, ensuring a dual impact-social  inclusion and environmental benefit. Additionally, we are  building a dedicated green asset portfolio, which includes  financing for EV charging infrastructure, critical to enabling  the broader EV ecosystem.

MANAGEMENT   DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW In 2024, the global economy achieved a growth rate of 3.2%, reflecting a measured pace of expansion. Nonetheless, this figure  fell short of the historical average of 3.7% recorded from 2000 to 2019. The deceleration was attributed to a confluence of both  structural and cyclical factors, including policy tightening in major economies, geopolitical instability, and sector-specific  challenges. Together, these elements exerted a profound impact on both advanced and emerging markets, leading to a more  subdued global economic environment. The economic performance of both advanced and emerging  economies followed distinctly different trajectories  throughout the year. Advanced economies struggled with  weak manufacturing activity, faltering consumer confidence,  and persistent inflationary pressures, all of which impeded  broader economic growth. Rising energy costs, disruptions  in global trade flows, and the continued impact of prior  monetary tightening further constrained demand. In contrast,  emerging markets and developing economies encountered  their own set of challenges, including subdued external  demand, capital outflows driven by rising interest rates in  developed nations, and considerable policy uncertainties.  Additionally, trade disruptions and geopolitical tensions  significantly contributed to the moderation of growth,  particularly in economies heavily reliant on exports. Despite  these challenges, certain emerging markets showed strength,  supported by strong domestic consumption and targeted  fiscal stimuli. ( Source:  https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/17/world-economic-outlook-update-january-2025) While inflationary trends varied across different economies,  global headline inflation showed a significant decrease  in 2024, falling from 5.7% in 2023 to 4.2%. This drop was  primarily driven by the stabilisation of energy prices and  the gradual resolution of ongoing supply chain challenges.  Throughout the year, central banks maintained a cautious  approach, carefully balancing monetary policy to support  economic recovery while ensuring inflation remained on a  downward trajectory. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to  continue its moderation, potentially reaching 3.5% by 2026,  provided geopolitical risks and supply-side shocks remain  under control. Performance of Major Economies in CY 2024 The U.S.:  The U.S. economy proved resilient in 2024,  supported by a strong labour market and sustained consumer  spending. However, the persistence of higher interest rates  exerted pressure on business investment and credit growth.  GDP Growth Projections (in %) Global Economy 3.20 3.30 3.30 1.70 1.90 1.80 4.20 4.20 4.30 Advanced Economies Emerging Markets and    Developing Economies CY 2024 CY 2025 CY 2026 68 Annual Report 2024-25 

As inflationary pressures receded, the Federal Reserve was  able to adopt a judicious and well-calibrated policy approach. Euro Area:  The Euro area faced a more restrained economic  climate, struggling with feeble industrial output, tepid  domestic demand, and the lingering effects of high borrowing  costs. Ongoing inflationary pressures and fluctuations in  energy prices further impeded the region’s growth prospects. China:  China’s economy registered a growth rate of 5.0%  in 2024, aligning with the government’s target. This growth  was primarily driven by industrial output and robust export  activity, although domestic consumption remained subdued,  constrained by prevailing uncertainties among the workforce. The global trade environment in 2024 remained precarious,  marred by rising protectionism, geopolitical strife, and  shifting trade alliances. Disputes between the United States  and China, coupled with tariffs and export restrictions,  severely disrupted global supply chains. Meanwhile,  nearshoring and friend-shoring initiatives introduced new  complexities and logistical challenges. Geopolitical tensions,  including the ongoing war in Ukraine and regional instability,  further fuelled economic uncertainty and market volatility.  Oil prices were projected to dip by 2.6% in 2025, driven by  weakening demand in China and an increase in non-OPEC+  supply, although geopolitical risks could upend this outlook.  Commodity-exporting nations, in particular, faced increased  vulnerability as shifts in trade patterns and disruptions to  supply chains undermined economic stability. In 2024, financial markets displayed a range of mixed  trajectories, with advanced economies experiencing rallies  in equity markets, while emerging markets contended with  heightened volatility, primarily due to capital outflows and  the upward trajectory of the US dollar. Persistent inflationary  trends and shifting expectations regarding interest rates  remained central to investor sentiment, with protracted  policy tightening posing significant risks to both economic  expansion and capital investment. Nations that embraced  sound economic policies and fostered strong global  collaboration appeared better positioned to weather the  prevailing uncertainties and maintain economic vitality. In the face of ongoing adversities, the global economy in  2024 exhibited considerable resilience, driven by nimble  trade strategies and a moderating inflationary trend. While  financial instability and geopolitical tensions continued  to present challenges, well-calibrated policy measures and  diversified economic strategies played a key role in mitigating  risks. The year highlighted the paramount importance  of adaptability, sound governance, and international  cooperation in maintaining growth amid a rapidly changing  global environment. Road Ahead As we look towards the future, the IMF projects global  growth to stabilise at 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026. However,  numerous risks persist, particularly emanating from policy  uncertainties, trade tensions, and deep-rooted structural  challenges in key economies. While the decline in inflation  offers some respite, the long-term sustainability of growth  will depend on the adoption of effective policy measures,  profound structural reforms, and collaborative international  efforts to navigate the changing economic landscape.  Ensuring robust economic resilience and fostering inclusive  growth will be crucial for sustaining stability in the coming  years.

This growth is primarily driven by substantial government  investment in infrastructure, a resurgence in rural demand  driven by a thriving Kharif crop, and the sustained expansion  of the services sector, notably in finance and real estate.  The Reserve Bank of India’s prudent, accommodative  monetary policy, which includes an interest rate reduction,  has further spurred both investment and consumption. In  addition, a marked improvement in manufacturing output  and resilient urban consumption have further invigorated  the economic momentum. While global trade uncertainties  remain an external risk, India’s intrinsic economic strength,  coupled with policy interventions and robust private sector  investments, is set to underpin continued growth. GDP Growth  (in %) FY 2020-21 FY 2021-22 FY 2022-23 FY 2023-24 FY 2024-25 (6.6) 8.7 7.0 7.2 6.5 Sector-wise Performance in FY 2024-25 Agriculture and Allied Sectors:  The agricultural sector  experienced a significant revival with a 4.6% growth in FY  2024-25, emerging from a period of subdued performance.  Beneficial monsoon conditions have led to a bumper Kharif  crop harvest, driving rural income growth and fuelling  increased demand. In parallel, government-led initiatives  focussed on empowering farmers and advancing agricultural  infrastructure have further reinforced the sector, fostering a  foundation for continuous growth and resilience. Industrial Sector:  The industrial sector recorded a GDP  growth of 6.1% in FY 2024-25, propelled by substantial  progress in construction and key utility sectors, including  electricity, gas, and water supply. The manufacturing  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 69 Shriram Finance Limited 

segment, in particular, has shown resilience, with increased  output across key industries, further strengthening the  overall industrial performance. Services Sector:  With its continued dominance in India’s  GDP, the services sector grew at a pace of 7.2% in FY 2024- 25, driven by financial, real estate, and professional services.  In parallel, trade, transport, and communication services  saw a growth of 6.4%, reflecting an uptick in both economic  momentum and consumer-driven demand. Construction Sector:  The construction sector recorded a  growth of 9.4% in FY 2024-25, largely driven by extensive  infrastructure development and an increase in investments.  Government allocations to key projects have played a critical  role in stimulating employment, while also fostering growth  in related industries. In a significant development, India’s inflation slowed to its  lowest level in nearly six years, with retail inflation eased to  3.16% in April 2025, remaining below the RBI’s 4% target for  the third consecutive month, as food prices rose at a slower  pace. The easing inflation also signals improving supply-side  dynamics, particularly across food and core components,  further reinforcing the outlook for sustained economic  momentum.   In its June 6, 2025  policy review, the RBI executed a   50  bps repo rate cut,  bringing the rate down to 5.50%, and  simultaneously trimmed the  Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)  by  100 bps,  injecting nearly INR 2.5 Trillion of liquidity into the  banking system. This front-loaded easing, building on earlier  cuts of 25 bps in February and April, signals a decisive pivot  to rejuvenate growth. The policy stance has shifted from  “accommodative” to “neutral,” reflecting a strategic pause,  even as the central bank signals readiness to act further if  conditions warrant. With inflation firmly under control and  ample liquidity, these measures aim to stimulate lending  (especially to MSMEs and retail borrowers), support credit  transmission, and fortify the broader economic recovery  amid external uncertainties. The Union Budget FY 2025–26 reinforced the  government’s commitment to sustainable growth while  maintaining fiscal discipline.  Capital expenditure was  raised to an unprecedented INR 11.21 Lakh Crores (~3.1%  of GDP), underscoring a strategic focus on infrastructure,  rural upliftment, and catalyzing private sector investment.  The fiscal deficit target was further trimmed to 4.9%,  demonstrating prudent budget management. A major boost  came from the RBI’s record dividend transfer of INR 2.69  Lakh Crores, substantially above the budgeted INR 2.56  Lakh Crores, which creates roughly INR 70,000 Crores of  extra fiscal room. This contribution alone could lower the  deficit by 20–30 bps, potentially bringing it near 4.2% of  GDP, or alternatively, enabling enhanced capital spending on  key priorities, all while preserving fiscal prudence. Consumption revival remained a key policy focus, with  higher allocations to rural flagship schemes, enhanced  Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs), and tax relief under the new  income tax regime effected to achieve intended outcome.  These steps are expected to strengthen disposable income  and boost consumption recovery, particularly among rural  and middle-income households. Road Ahead The Indian economy is projected to experience a growth  rate ranging from 6.3% to 6.8% in FY 2025-26, driven by  transformative structural reforms, digital evolutions, and a  rising wave of consumer demand. Initiatives such as Make  in India and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes  are strengthening the manufacturing sector, channelling  significant investments into key sectors like electronics,  semiconductors, and renewable energy. In parallel, large-scale infrastructure projects—spanning  highways, ports, and smart city developments—are expected  to enhance economic activity and generate substantial  employment prospects. With continued policy support and  strategic investments, India is well-positioned to sustain its  growth trajectory, solidifying its role as a global economic  powerhouse.

The Reserve Bank of  India (RBI) initiated a cycle of monetary easing, reducing  key policy rates to stimulate economic growth. Despite this,  banks struggled with higher borrowing costs, exacerbated by  the rising demand for infrastructure bonds. As of February  2025, the liquidity shortfall had escalated to approximately  Rs. 1.7 Trillion. To counterbalance this, the RBI intervened  with a USD 10 Billion forex swap, designed to stabilise short- term interest rates and ensure financial equilibrium. The sector’s transformation was further strengthened by  rapid technological advancements. The advent of Artificial  Intelligence (AI), Open Banking, and digital currencies  has become pivotal in refining financial services. The  introduction of the Digital Rupee marked a significant step  towards a fully cashless economy. AI-driven innovations  enhanced both customer experience and risk management,  while Open Banking paved the way for broader financial  inclusion. Simultaneously, the insurance industry adapted  70 Annual Report 2024-25 

to emerging risks, with health insurers in Delhi considering  premium adjustments due to the increasing prevalence of air  pollution-related health issues. However, the sector continues to face challenges, including  rising levels of unsecured lending and an increase in  credit card delinquencies, particularly among younger  demographics. The recent interest rate cuts have also placed  additional pressure on banks’ net interest margins. Despite  these obstacles, India’s financial services sector remains well- positioned for sustained growth and long-term resilience,  supported by proactive regulatory measures, robust digital  infrastructure, and a persistent commitment to financial  inclusion.

As of  FY 2024-25, the sector has expanded to approximately USD  350 Billion, marking a consistent increase from the previous  year’s USD 326 Billion. However, the growth of the sector’s  Assets Under Management (AUM) is forecasted to moderate,  with year-on-year growth projections for FY 2024-25 and FY  2025-26 ranging between 15-17%, a decline from the robust  23% recorded in FY 2023-24. This deceleration is attributed to  mounting challenges such as rising delinquencies, intensified  regulatory frameworks, and tighter funding conditions.  Despite these obstacles, essential lending verticals, including  SME financing, loans against property (LAP), and used  vehicle financing, are poised to continue their growth  trajectory, demonstrating the sector’s resilience in the face of  adversity. Regulatory and Market Dynamics Regulatory reforms continue to reshape the NBFC landscape,  with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) implementing scale- based regulations to enhance governance, risk management,  and operational stability. The focus on diversifying funding  sources to reduce reliance on traditional banking channels  has become more critical in ensuring liquidity and financial  health. Additionally, the sector faces increasing competition  from traditional banks and fintech players, necessitating  strategic realignments to maintain market relevance. The  RBI’s emphasis on prudent lending practices, particularly in  unsecured loan segments, highlights the need for NBFCs to  strengthen their risk assessment frameworks and financial  prudence. Technological Advancements and Emerging  Opportunities Digital transformation remains a key growth enabler for  NBFCs, with the adoption of AI-driven credit assessments,  digital lending platforms,  and data-driven risk management  significantly enhancing efficiency and customer accessibility.  The government’s push for financial inclusion, along with  initiatives like PMJDY and Mudra Yojana, further supports  the sector’s expansion into underserved markets. Meanwhile,  co-lending partnerships with banks and increased Foreign  Direct Investment (FDI) are providing access to low- cost capital, strengthening financial sustainability. While  challenges such as regulatory compliance, competition  from banks and fintech’s, and macroeconomic uncertainties  persist, NBFCs that leverage technology, diversify funding  sources, and strengthen risk management frameworks will  be well-positioned for sustainable growth. The sector’s ability  to innovate and adapt will ultimately determine its long-term  success in India’s evolving financial landscape.

Retail sales have  shown an upward trend, recording an 8.22% year-on-year  (YoY) growth in January 2025. However, wholesale volumes  have faced a slowdown, declining by 3.2% YoY. Medium  and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCVs) are expected  to reach peak production levels of nearly 550,000 units,  supported by infrastructure development and government  policies like the vehicle scrappage programme. On the other  hand, Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) are witnessing  stagnation or slight declines due to a high base effect and  rising competition from electric three-wheelers. Meanwhile,  the bus segment is experiencing strong momentum, with an  estimated 8-11% growth, driven by increased demand for  public transport modernisation. The sector’s future trajectory remains positive, with  infrastructure investments, replacement demand, and  growth in key industries such as coal, steel, and cement  acting as strong tailwinds.

In FY 2025, the sector achieved  an all-time high in sales, registering a 2.0% year-on-year  increase to approximately 43 lakh units. However, this  growth has been tempered by the high base effect from the  preceding years. Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) continue to  lead the market, driven by strong consumer interest and a  wave of new product introductions. Additionally, favourable  government policies and a stable macroeconomic backdrop  have reinforced consumer confidence, sustaining demand  despite inflationary pressures and rising borrowing costs.  That said, the competitive intensity within the sector remains  formidable, leading to significant pricing pressures and the  imperative for continuous innovation to maintain market  dominance. Looking ahead, the passenger vehicle market is poised to  reach a remarkable valuation of USD 300 billion by 2026,  driven by escalating income levels, urbanisation trends, and  an increasing middle class with enhanced purchasing capacity.  The electric vehicle (EV) segment, in particular, is expected  to emerge as a primary growth catalyst in the coming years,  fuelled by investments in EV technology and the expansion  of necessary infrastructure. Nonetheless, challenges such  as limited charging infrastructure and affordability issues  continue to pose barriers to mass adoption. Additionally,  the increasing integration of digitalisation within the sector  is redefining sales, marketing, and customer engagement,  with manufacturers utilising online platforms to drive  growth. Despite short-term challenges, the long-term  growth trajectory remains positive, underpinned by robust  demand in the SUV segment and the accelerating pace of  electrification.

In FY 2025, the sector saw a robust  growth of more than 9%, with significant contributions from  internal combustion engine (ICE) motorcycles, scooters,  and electric vehicles (EVs). ICE two-wheelers retain their  dominance with an 88% market share, benefiting from a  mature infrastructure and price competitiveness. However,  the electric vehicle segment is swiftly gaining ground, with  retail sales soaring by 33% in FY 2025, and future forecasts  predicting a 21% CAGR from FY 2025 to FY 2029.Rising  consumer interest in premium features, eco-friendly urban  mobility options, and government-backed incentives for EV  adoption are further accelerating growth, making the two- wheeler industry a cornerstone of India’s transportation  transformation. Looking ahead, the market is expected to grow at a more  tempered rate of 2-4% in FY 2025, influenced by the high  base effect of previous years. While the electric two-wheeler  market continues to expand, challenges such as insufficient  charging infrastructure and fierce competition from both  established industry players and new entrants continue  to pose challenges. The future of the sector will be steered  by ongoing technological innovations, including the  integration of smart connectivity, enhanced safety features,  and performance optimisations. With government policies  facilitating electrification and urbanisation, the sector is set  for sustained long-term growth, contingent on addressing  infrastructure gaps and maintaining a strong emphasis on  innovation.

While tractor  sales witnessed a decline of 1.5% in 2024, primarily due to  subdued demand in the first half of the year, a robust rebound  in the second half has resulted in a 5% year-on-year growth  from April to December. In January 2025, domestic tractor  sales increased by 11.31%, reflecting an uptick in demand  driven by timely monsoons, enhanced crop acreage, and  the accelerating trend of farm mechanisation. Furthermore,  government-backed initiatives, including subsidy schemes  and tax incentives, are propelling sectoral growth, while  cutting-edge technologies like GPS-integrated tractors  and precision farming solutions are enhancing operational  efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The Indian agricultural tractor market, valued at USD 7.42  million in 2023, is set to expand significantly, with projections  suggesting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.70%  through to 2032, culminating in an estimated value of USD  11.68 million.

Initiatives such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and the  Smart Cities Mission have stimulated demand, while exports  have grown significantly—from 4,139 units in H1 2022 to  7,348 units in H1 2024. The use of advanced technologies,  particularly automation and telematics, is improving both  productivity and operational efficiency across a variety of  equipment. Looking ahead, the Indian construction equipment market is  projected to attain a valuation of USD 29.5 Billion, clocking in  a CAGR of 11.91% from FY 2024-25 to FY 2031-32. Despite  this promising outlook, the industry faces several challenges,  including market fluctuations caused by factors like the  Model Code of Conduct and prolonged monsoons, leading  to a subdued 3% year-on-year growth in H1 FY 2024-25.  Segment-wise, earthmoving equipment has shown modest  growth, while material handling machinery has witnessed  a decline.

MSMEs have played  a crucial role in India’s export performance, with MSME  exports growing from Rs. 3.95 Lakh Crores in FY 2020-21  to Rs. 12.39 Lakh Crores in FY 2024-25, highlighting their  increasing global presence. Additionally, the sector witnessed  significant expansion, 5.93 Crore MSMEs registered on the  Udyam Portal as of 4th February, 2025, including 5.84 Crore  micro enterprises. The government’s decision to revise the  MSME classification criteria in the Union Budget 2025,  increasing investment limits is expected to further support  business scalability while retaining the benefits associated  with the sector. The sector’s growth trajectory will be shaped by continued  government initiatives such as increased credit guarantees,  special credit cards for small businesses and expanded  procurement support. Public sector procurement from  micro and small enterprises (MSEs) reached Rs. 71,560  Crores, benefiting 2.02 Lakh MSEs as of April 2024. However,  challenges such as limited credit accessibility, infrastructure  bottlenecks, and competitive global markets persist. With  MSMEs contributing nearly 30% to India’s GDP and  accounting for 40% of the country’s exports, sustained policy  support and investment in infrastructure will be crucial in  maintaining their growth momentum and fostering long- term resilience in the sector.  The MSME sector also plays a vital role in employment  generation, providing livelihoods to millions across urban  and rural India. With its contribution to nearly 45% of the  country’s total manufacturing output, the sector remains  a backbone of industrial development. The increasing  digitalisation of MSMEs, driven by fintech solutions and  e-commerce platforms is further enhancing their market reach  and operational efficiency. Additionally, the rise of sustainable  and green manufacturing practices within MSMEs is gaining  traction, aligning with global environmental standards and  enhancing their competitiveness in international markets.  Strengthening digital infrastructure, skill development  programmes and technology adoption will be key to  unlocking the full potential of the sector in the coming years.

Traditionally dominated by rural borrowers and  small-scale businesses, the sector is now witnessing an  increasing adoption among salaried professionals and self- employed individuals to address their immediate liquidity  needs. The convenience of gold loans, facilitated by minimal  paperwork and rapid approval processes, has contributed  significantly to their rising popularity.

advent of digitalisation has played a key role in enhancing  the efficacy of loan applications and disbursements, thereby  broadening access through online channels and mobile apps. Additionally, NBFCs are concentrating their efforts on  product innovation to cater to an increasingly diverse  customer demographic. New gold loan products, featuring  flexible repayment schedules, reduced interest rates, and  enhanced loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, are being introduced  to appeal to a wide array of borrowers. The growing trend of  digital gold loans, which allows customers to electronically  pledge their gold, is reshaping the landscape of the industry.  Additionally, synergies between fintech companies and  conventional lenders are enhancing the customer experience  by offering streamlined loan processes and real-time  valuation of gold assets. Although the sector has demonstrated significant growth, it  continues to contend with obstacles like regulatory tightening  and the inherent volatility of gold prices. The Reserve Bank  of India’s intensification of regulatory supervision has  enforced stricter compliance protocols for lenders, thereby  promoting transparency and fostering equitable lending  practices. Additionally, fluctuations in gold prices present  a double-edged sword: rising valuations encourage greater  loan disbursements, yet price declines may expose lenders to  amplified risks.

Rising Demand for MSME Financing:  The rapid expansion  of India’s MSME sector presents significant opportunities for  targeted financial lending and industry-specific solutions. Digital Transformation:  Enhanced fintech collaborations,  AI-driven lending models, and mobile-based customer  engagement platforms are poised to boost operational  efficiency and broaden customer outreach. Strategic Divestments:  The recent divestment of Shriram  Housing Finance to Warburg Pincus facilitates the unlocking  of capital to fuel core business expansion initiatives. Expanding Product Portfolio:  Introducing innovative  financial products like unsecured loans, comprehensive  insurance packages, and dynamic working capital solutions  will substantially enrich revenue streams and enhance  market presence.

Risk Type and Definition Mitigation MSME Finance Risk MSME financing risk pertains to the  potential for financial detriment or adverse  consequences arising from the provision  of financial services to Micro, Small,  and Medium Enterprises. This risk is  influenced by a myriad of factors, including  the creditworthiness of borrowers, market  instabilities, operational inefficiencies,  regulatory adherence, interest rate  volatility, technological advancements,  and unforeseen external disturbances. To proficiently navigate and mitigate risks, Shriram Finance employs an array of  strategic measures. The Company conducts comprehensive credit assessments,  carefully identifying financial statements, cash flow trends, collateral valuations, and  credit histories. Furthermore, risk exposure is minimised through prudent portfolio  diversification, strategically allocating loans across diverse sectors, geographical  regions, and borrower categories. Interest Rate Risk The potential for financial loss stemming  from adverse shifts in interest rates,  impacting both lending and treasury  operations. This risk is a fundamental  determinant of a company’s net interest  income and overall financial profitability,  significantly influencing its fiscal stability. Shriram Finance has instituted a comprehensive set of policies and procedures  to ensure strict compliance with regulatory mandates governing asset and liability  management. The Company conducts an in-depth evaluation of rate-sensitive assets  and liabilities, meticulously assessing the alignment between the maturity profiles of  its loan book and fluctuations in interest rates. In determining interest spreads, assets and liabilities are categorised into distinct  timeframes based on their contractual maturities or anticipated re-pricing schedules.  The discrepancy between the maturities of assets and liabilities, or their re-pricing  potential at any given juncture, signifies the Company’s exposure to potential margin  variations on newly originated or re-priced assets and liabilities. Liquidity Risk This risk arises when Shriram Finance  faces obstacles in meeting its financial  commitments within the stipulated  deadlines or as per the agreed schedules. Shriram Finance adeptly addresses liquidity risk through a meticulously structured  framework of policies and procedures, rigorously endorsed by the Asset Liability  Management Committee (ALCO).

DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION POLICY Preamble Dividend is the payment made by a Company to its  shareholders in the form of distribution of its profits. The  profits earned by the Company can either be retained  in business and used for acquisitions, expansion or  diversification, or it can be distributed to the shareholders.  The Company may choose to retain a part of its profits and  distribute the balance among its shareholders as dividend.  This Dividend Distribution Policy (‘Policy’) aims to reconcile  between all these needs in accordance with the applicable  laws. The objective of this Policy is to ensure a regular dividend  income for the shareholders and long term capital  appreciation for all shareholders of the Company. The  Company would ensure to strike the right balance between  the quantum of dividend paid and the amount of profits  retained in the business for various purposes. The Board  of Directors (Board) will refer to the Policy while declaring  interim dividend(s)/ recommending final dividend. Through  this Policy, the Company would endeavour fairness,  consistency and sustainability while distributing profits to  the shareholders. This Policy also stipulates the process for recommendation/ declaration of dividend(s) and its pay-out by the Company  in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013 (‘the Act’), SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure  Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘Listing Regulations’),  guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) and other  rules, regulations etc. as applicable to the Company. Class of Shares The Company has issued only Equity Shares and no  Preference shares issued by the Company are outstanding. Category of Dividends The Act provides for two forms of Dividend- Final and  Interim. The Board shall have the absolute power to declare  interim dividend during the financial year, as and when they  consider it fit. Normally, the Board will endeavour to declare  an interim dividend after finalisation of quarterly financial  accounts. The Board may declare interim dividend based on  profits of the Company, one or more times in a financial year  as and when considered appropriate, in line with this policy. After the audited financial statements are approved, the Board  may recommend final dividend to the shareholders for their  approval in the Annual General Meeting of the Company.  In the event the Board declares more than one interim  dividend in a financial year, the Board may recommend to  the shareholder to treat the last interim dividend as a final  Dividend. Recommendation / Declaration of Dividend Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Board shall  recommend/declare/ pay the Dividend only out of- i)   Current financial year’s profit:   a)     after providing for depreciation in accordance with  law and setting off carried over previous losses and  depreciation not provided in previous year(s), if  any,.   b)     after transferring to reserves such amount as  may be prescribed under the Act or applicable  law, regulations, norms or as may be otherwise  considered appropriate by the Board at its  discretion. ii)   The profits for any previous financial year(s):   a)     after providing for depreciation in accordance with  law;   b)   remaining undistributed; or iii)   out of i) & ii) both. iv)     out of free reserves in the manner permissible under the  Act. Factors to be considered while declaring Dividend The decision regarding dividend is a crucial decision as it  determines the amount of profit to be distributed among  shareholders and amount of profit to be retained in business.  The Board will endeavour to take a decision with an objective  to enhance shareholders wealth and market value of the  shares. However, the decision regarding dividend is subject  to several factors and hence any optimal policy in this regard  may be far from obvious. The Board considers a stable  dividend to constitute an important element of the Company’s  investment attractiveness and shareholder return. The  Company is classified as Investment and Credit Company by  RBI, operates in rapidly developing, yet a volatile market. The  Company’s primary need is to maintain sufficient resources  and financial flexibility to meet financial and operational  requirements. The Company continually seeks ways to create  shareholder value through both commercial and financial  strategies, which may include both organic and inorganic  development as well as the Company’s capital management  practices. The shareholders of the Company may not expect dividend  for a financial year(s) in the circumstances of challenging/ sluggish market conditions, tough liquidity position, losses  or inadequate profits. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 143 Shriram Finance Limited 

The Board, while considering the proposals for dividend,  will also take into account the supervisory findings, if any,  of the RBI on divergence in classification and provisioning  for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and qualifications, if  any, in the Auditors’ Report to the financial statements of  the Company or emphasis of matter by the statutory auditor  that indicates an overstatement of net profit. In case the net  profit for the relevant period includes any exceptional and/or  extra-ordinary profits/ income, the net profit shall be suitably  adjusted to exclude such extra-ordinary items for computing  dividend pay-out ratio. The decision regarding recommendation/declaration of  dividend will depend upon various external and internal  factors including the following: External Factors:- State of Economy-  in case of uncertain or recessionary  economic and business conditions, the Board will endeavour  to retain larger part of profits to build up reserves to absorb  future shocks. Capital Markets-  when the markets are favourable, dividend  pay-out can be liberal. However, in case of unfavourable  market conditions, Board may resort to a conservative  dividend pay-out in order to conserve cash outflows. Statutory and Contractual Restrictions-  The Board needs to  keep in mind the restrictions imposed under the Companies  Act and any other laws, the regulatory developments with  regard to declaration of dividend, the Company’s contractual  obligations under the loan agreements / debenture trust deed  and other agreements, documents, writings limiting / putting  restrictions on dividend pay-out. Internal Factors:-  Apart from the various external factors aforementioned, the  Board will take into account various internal factors while  recommending / declaring Dividend, which inter alia will  include- (B)   Other factors   i)   Profits earned during the year;   ii)     Present and future capital requirements of the  existing businesses; / capital expenditures and the  Company’s debt position;   iii)   Business Acquisitions opportunities;   iv)     Expansion/ Modernisation of existing businesses; /  growth opportunities available to the Company;   v)   Long term growth plans of the Company;   vi)     Additional investments in subsidiaries/associates  of the Company;   vii)   Fresh investments into external businesses;   viii)   Cash flow from operations;   ix)   Cost of raising funds;   x)     Providing for unforeseen events and contingencies   with financial implication;   xi)   Quality of assets and NPA;   xii)   Asset-Liability Management Position; The Company will ensure that the eligibility criteria prescribed by the regulatory authorities under the applicable law are met  including the following minimum prudential requirement for declaration of dividend prescribed by RBI: Sl.

The Company will fix Record date for the purpose of  determination for list of shareholders eligible to receive  dividend.

The intimation for fixing Record date shall be given  to exchange at least seven working days in advance  (excluding the date of intimation and the record date). In the event of any amendment in SEBI (Listing Obligations  and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 or  any other applicable law with respect to the process of  recommendation/approval/payment of dividend, the same  shall prevail and shall be deemed to form part of this policy. The Company stands committed to deliver sustainable value  to all its stakeholders. The Company will strive to distribute  an optimal and appropriate level of the profits earned by  it in business with the shareholders’ funds in the form of  dividend. As explained in the earlier part of this Policy,  determining the dividend pay-out is dependent upon several  factors, both internal to a business and external to it. Taking  into consideration the aforementioned factors the Board may  consider maintaining a Dividend Pay-out ratio in the range  of 20-25% of the profits after tax (PAT), subject to applicable  regulations. However, the Board may amend the pay-out  range, whenever considered appropriate by it, keeping in  mind the aforesaid factors having a bearing on the dividend  pay-out decision, subject to maximum dividend payout  ratio of 50%. However, if the Company does not meet the  applicable prudential requirement prescribed above for each  of the last three financial years, may be eligible to declare  dividend, subject to a cap of 10% on the dividend payout  ratio, provided the Company complies with the following  conditions : (a)    meets the applicable minimum capital adequacy  requirement in the financial year for which it proposes  to pay dividend; and (b)     has net NPA of less than 4 per cent as at the close of the  financial year. The Dividend Payout Ratio is the ratio between the amount  of the dividend payable in a year and the net profit as per the  audited financial statements for the financial year for which  the dividend is proposed. Manner of Payment of dividend The Company shall use any of the electronic mode of payment  facility approved by the Reserve Bank for the payment of the  dividends. Where it is not possible to use electronic mode of  payment, ‘payable-at-par’ warrants or Demand drafts will be  issued to the eligible shareholders. Transfer of Unpaid / Unclaimed Dividend and Equity  Shares to Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) As per section 124(5) of the Companies Act, the dividend  which remains unpaid / unclaimed for a period of seven (7)  consecutive years or more from the date of transfer to unpaid  dividend account shall be transferred by the Company to  IEPF. Utilisation of Retained Earnings The Retained earnings strengthen the Company’s net owned  funds. It will further help in maintaining Capital Adequacy  Ratio (CAR) for Non-Banking Financial Companies  (NBFCs) in the growth phase. The Board from time to time  will decide utilisation of the retained earnings depending  upon various factors including organic / inorganic growth  strategies of the Company, market competition, creating long  term shareholder value etc. The Board will ensure judicious  balancing of these factors in the interest of the Company and  its stakeholders. Reporting Requirements The Company shall report details of dividend declared during  the financial year as per the prescribed format in Annex IX of  the Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Non- Banking  Financial Company – Scale Based Regulation) Directions,  2023 issued by RBI on October 19, 2023, as updated from  time to time within a fortnight after declaration of dividend  to the Regional Office of the Department of Supervision of  the Reserve Bank, under whose jurisdiction the Company is  registered.

If not properly managed, these  emissions and other pollutants  from operations and related  activities can pose significant  legal and environmental risks for  the Company. The Company places a strong  emphasis on sustainability and  recognizes the importance of  cutting down greenhouse gas  emissions. The Company is  committed to adopting eco- friendly policies, enhancing  energy efficiency, and engaging  in carbon offset programs as  part of its ongoing sustainability  efforts. These efforts are aimed  at reducing its environmental  footprint and contribute to  building a more sustainable  future. Negative  2 Climate  Change  Risk Climate change poses various  risks to business operations,  ranging from physical threats  like floods and wildfires to  transitional challenges such as  shifts in renewable energy policies  and the introduction of carbon  taxes. However, these challenges  offer an opportunity to assess its  vulnerabilities and take proactive  steps to reduce potential risks. To address the risks posed  by climate change, the  Company has developed a  strategy focused on reducing  its environmental footprint,  supporting renewable energy  investments, encouraging  energy-saving practices, and  promoting sustainable finance  to strengthen climate resilience.

Sr.  No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying the  risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate positive  or negative  implications) As a part of this approach, the  Company has also updated  its lending policy to avoid  financing older vehicles that  are more likely to contribute to  carbon emissions. This year, the  Company has taken meaningful  steps toward these goals,  including: 1.     Measuring and reporting  the Scope 3 emissions, and 2.     Introducing a Vendor Code  of Conduct that includes  key ESG (Environmental,  Social, and Governance)  criteria.  3 Customer  Support and  Satisfaction  Risk In the Non-Banking Financial  Company (NBFC) sector,  customer satisfaction plays a  vital role. While a poor customer  experience can put business  continuity at risk, a positive  experience can boost profitability  and enhance the Company’s  brand image. To minimise customer  dissatisfaction, the Company  focuses on clear communication,  personalised services, prompt  issue resolution, and continuous  feedback collection. It also  invests in robust complaint  management systems, regular  staff training, and strict  compliance with regulatory  standards, all to ensure customer  satisfaction and maintain their  trust.  Negative  4 Financial  Inclusion Opportunity Financial inclusion is a key  priority for the Company, as  it plays a vital role in reducing  economic inequality, improving  quality of life, and increasing  access to credit, ultimately driving  economic growth. By focusing on  financial inclusion, the Company  is able to reach new customer  segments, grow its client base,  and promote financial literacy  and stability within communities.   Positive  5 Responsible  Financing Opportunity Responsible financing is a  core value for the Company,  as it ensures financial stability,  protects borrower rights, and  strengthens the Company’s  reputation. It also helps build  trust in the financial system,  reduces the risk of loan defaults,  and supports long-term growth  for the NBFC. In addition, ethical  lending practices can attract  more investment and contribute  to the country’s overall economic  development. The Company’s approach to  responsible financing involves  thoroughly assessing borrowers  and their collateral, strictly  following regulatory guidelines,  and maintaining strong internal  governance. It also includes  using effective risk assessment  frameworks, promoting  financial literacy, and fostering  transparency and accountability  in all financial transactions.

Protecting customer  data remains one of the highest  priorities. To protect against data  security and privacy threats,  the Company has put robust  measures in place, including  strict access controls, encryption  of sensitive information, regular  security assessments, and  employee training programs  focused on responsible data  handling practices. Negative  7 Employee  Wellbeing  Risk Prioritising employee well-being  boosts morale and has a positive  impact on overall performance.  It also helps reduce recruitment- related costs by improving  retention and job satisfaction. The Company is dedicated to  supporting employee well-being  and enhancing productivity.  The Company conducts regular  health check-ups, promote  a healthy work-life balance,  provide access to mental  health resources, offer stress  management training, and  ensure a secure and welcoming  work environment for all. Negative  8 Diversity and  Inclusion Opportunity A strong culture of diversity and  inclusion reflects a workplace  where employees feel valued,  respected, and a true sense of  belonging. By actively supporting  underrepresented groups, the  Company not only fosters  equity but also builds a positive,  community-focused brand  image. Positive  9 Corporate  Governance  Risk Companies are assessed based on  how they manage key governance  issues like ownership structure,  executive compensation, financial  transparency, ethical behavior,  and tax disclosure. These factors  reflect the Company’s overall  governance standards and their  impact on shareholders and the  wider investment community. To address corporate governance  challenges, the Company puts  strong internal policies in  place, conducts regular audits,  ensures strict compliance with  legal standards, and fosters a  culture of transparency and  accountability. It also prioritizes  effective risk management to  safeguard stakeholder interests. Negative  10 Business  Ethics  Risk Upholding business ethics  involves effectively managing  and addressing issues such as  fraud, executive misconduct,  corruption, money laundering,  and violations of competition  laws. Failing to maintain ethical  standards can lead to legal action,  hefty fines, settlement costs, and  serious damage to the Company’s  reputation. The Company maintains high  ethical standards through a  comprehensive risk mitigation  strategy. This includes regular  training to promote ethical  behavior among employees,  strict regulatory compliance,  strong internal governance, and  thorough client due diligence.  These efforts are essential to  preserving the Company’s  integrity and building  stakeholder trust. Negative BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 161 Shriram Finance Limited

Failing to comply can  result in serious consequences,  including financial penalties,  legal action, and damage to  the Company’s reputation and  consumer trust. The Company ensures  compliance with applicable  legal and regulatory standards  by maintaining accurate  records, conducting regular  internal audits, providing  ongoing employee training,  and engaging with regulatory  authorities to stay updated on  evolving requirements. Negative  12 Fraud Risk  Management  Risk As a NBFC, managing fraud  risk is a top priority. Fraudulent  activities can lead to significant  financial losses and damage the  Company’s reputation, ultimately  undermining customer trust and  confidence. The Company takes a  comprehensive approach to  minimising fraud risks. This  includes regular internal audits,  strengthening governance  practices, leveraging anti- fraud technologies, promoting  a culture of integrity, and  providing ongoing training  to employees, all aimed at  protecting stakeholders and  maintaining trust. Negative  13 Innovation Opportunity For a NBFC, embracing digital  and business innovation is  essential. It enhances operational  efficiency, reduces costs,  improves customer service, and  expands market reach. Adopting  digital solutions is also crucial to  staying competitive and meeting  the evolving expectations of  consumers in today’s fast-paced,  technology-driven financial  landscape.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REASONABLE ASSURANCE REPORT ON IDENTIFIED SUSTAINABILITY  INFORMATION IN SHRIRAM FINANCE LIMITED’s BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025. To the Board of Directors of Shriram Finance Limited,  1.     We have undertaken to perform Reasonable Assurance engagement, for Shriram Finance Limited (the “Company” or  “SFL”) vide our engagement letter dated March 17, 2025 in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed below  (the “Identified Sustainability Information” or “BRSR Core indicators”) in accordance with the Criteria stated in paragraph  3 below. This Sustainability Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) of  the Company for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. This engagement was conducted by our multidisciplinary team  including assurance practitioners, environmental engineers and specialists. 2.   Identified Sustainability Information      Our scope of Reasonable Assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to our report. The reporting  boundary of the BRSR is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosures of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed  by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable.     Our Reasonable Assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information only and we have  not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods, and any elements thereto, and, therefore, do not express any  opinion thereon. 3.    Criteria   The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:     The criteria used is the “BRSR Core”, which is a subset of the BRSR, consisting of a set of Key Performance Indicators  (“KPIs”)/ metrics under nine Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) attributes, as per the format of BRSR Core  specified in Annexure 17A, read with the format of BRSR and the Guidance Note given in Annexure 16 and 17, respectively,  of the SEBI Master Circular for ‘compliance with the provisions of the SEBI LODR Regulations, 2025 by Listed Entities’ dated  November 11, 2024, and the SEBI Circular on the ’Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core’ dated December 20, 2024  (collectively referred to as the “SEBI Circulars”). 4.    Management’s Responsibility     The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified  Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of the BRSR, disclosing environmental information basis  operational control approach, taking into account applicable laws and regulations including the SEBI circulars, related to  reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content,  preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility  includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the  measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error.     The Management and the Board of Directors of the Company are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s compliance  with the requirements of LODR Regulations and the SEBI Circular in relation to the BRSR Core. 5.    Inherent limitations     The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non- financial information  allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between companies.     Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to inherent measurement  uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint and waste. Obtaining sufficient appropriate  evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 6.    Our Independence and Quality Control     We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by  the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/ CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the required competencies and experience to  conduct this assurance engagement. 198 Annual Report 2024-25 

    We apply Standard on Quality Control (the “SQC”) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of  Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintain a  comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical  requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 7.    Our Responsibility     Our responsibility is to express a Reasonable Assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in  Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.     We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000,  “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements (SAE) 3410 “Assurance  Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” (together the “Standards”), both issued by the Sustainability Reporting  Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.     These Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain Reasonable Assurance about whether the  Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the Report are prepared, in all material respects,  in accordance with the Criteria.     As part of Reasonable Assurance engagement in accordance with the Standards, we exercise professional judgment and  maintain professional skepticism throughout the engagement. 8.    Reasonable Assurance     A Reasonable Assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified  Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances.     The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes  performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies and  agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.   Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: •   Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures. •   Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements of  the Identified Sustainability Information. •   Made inquiries of Company’s management, including secretarial team, finance team, human resource team amongst  others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the BRSR. •   Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls for  recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate office and at other  locations/offices on a sample basis under the reporting boundary. This included evaluating the design of those controls  relevant to the engagement and determining whether they have been implemented by performing procedures in  addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the Identified Sustainability Information. •   Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially  misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures. •   Where applicable, for the Identified Sustainability Information in the BRSR, we have relied on the information in the  audited standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025 and the underlying trial  balance. •   Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and judgements made by the management in  the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information. •   Tested the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the Identified  Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis. •   Tested the consolidation working of the corporate office and other locations/offices on a sample basis under the  reporting boundary for ensuring the completeness of data being reported; and •   Obtained representations from the Company’s management. BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 199 Shriram Finance Limited 

  We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.     We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance  opinion. 9.    Exclusions   Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on:   •   Operations of the Company other than the Identified Sustainability Information in Appendix I;   •     Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) included in the BRSR other than the  Identified Sustainability Information; and Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., April 1, 2024  – March 31, 2025;   •     The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by  the Company. 10.    Other information     The Company’s management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information  included within the BRSR other than Identified Sustainability Information and our independent assurance report dated June  23, 2025 thereon.     Our opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does not cover the other information and we do not express any  form of assurance thereon.     In connection with our assurance engagement of the Identified Sustainability Information, our responsibility is to read the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Identified  Sustainability Information or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.     If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are  required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 11.    Reasonable Assurance Opinion     Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the Company’s Identified Sustainability  Information listed in Appendix I for the year ended March 31, 2025 (as stated under “Identified Sustainability Information”)  are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria (as stated under “Criteria”). 12.    Restriction on use Our Reasonable Assurance report has been prepared and addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company at the request  of the Company solely, to assist the Company in reporting on Company’s sustainability performance and activities. Accordingly, we accept no liability to anyone, other than the Company. Our Reasonable Assurance report should not be used  for any other purpose or by any person other than the addressees of our report.

FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS  

INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT   To the Members of Shriram Finance Limited REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Opinion 1.   We have audited the accompanying Standalone  Financial Statements of Shriram Finance Limited (the  “Company”), which comprise the Standalone Balance  Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Standalone Statement  of Profit And Loss (including Other Comprehensive  Income/Loss), the Standalone Statement of Cash Flow  and the Standalone Statement of changes in equity for  the year ended, and notes to the Standalone Financial  Statements, including a summary of the material  accounting policies and other explanatory information  (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial  Statements”). 2.   In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid  Standalone Financial Statements give the information  required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the  manner so required and give a true and fair view in  conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind  AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,  2015, as amended, the relevant circulars, guidelines  and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India  (“RBI”) from time to time (“RBI Guidelines”) and other  accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the  state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025, and  its profit (including other comprehensive income), its  cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended  on that date. Basis for Opinion 3.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section  143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those  standards are further described in the Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements section of our report. We are independent  of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements  that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements under the provisions of the Act and the rules  thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements  and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit  evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion on the Standalone  Financial Statements. Key Audit Matter 4.   Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in our  audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the  financial year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were  addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate  opinion on these matters. 5.   We have determined the matter described below to be  the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 204 Annual Report 2024-25 

Information other than the Standalone Financial  Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon 6.   The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible  for the preparation of other information. The other  information comprises the information included in  the Board’s Report, (including annexures thereto),  and Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”)  (collectively referred to as “Other Information”), but  does not include the Standalone Financial Statements  and our auditor’s report thereon.    Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements  does not cover the Other Information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.   In connection with our audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the  Other Information and, in doing so, consider whether  the  Other Information is materially inconsistent with  the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge  obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise  appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work  Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Impairment Loss Allowance of loans and advances (Reference to Note 12 & 39 read with Material  Accounting Policies Note 6.1(VI).  (in INR crores) Gross Advances 2,59,915.91 Provisions 14,523.12 Net Advances 2,45,392.79 Significant estimates and judgments involved in  Key Audit Matter Reserve Bank of India has issued Master circular  and other clarifications on Income Recognition and  Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to  Advances (“IRAC”). These guidelines prescribe the  prudential norms for identification and classification  of advances as Stage 3/ NPAs. The Company has applied significant judgement to  determine the identification and classification of  such assets as Stage 3/ NPAs by applying quantitative  as well as qualitative factors. The risk of identification  of such assets as Stage 3/ NPAs is affected by factors  like stress and liquidity concerns of such assets. Impairment loss allowance of loans and advances  (“Impairment loss allowance”) is a Key Audit  Matter as the Company has significant credit risk  exposure considering the large loan portfolio across  a wide geographical range. The value of loans and  advances on the balance sheet is significant and  there is a high degree of complexity and judgment  involved in estimating individual and collective  credit impairment provisions, write-offs against  these loans and to additionally determine the  asset quality and provision of the Company. The  Company’s model to calculate Expected Credit  Loss (“ECL”) is inherently complex and judgment is  applied in determining the correct construction of  the three-stage impairment model (“ECL Model”)  including the selection and input of forward-looking  information. ECL provision calculation require  the use of large volumes of data. The completeness  and reliability of data can significantly impact  accuracy of the modelled impairment provisions.  The accuracy of data flows and the implementation  of related controls are critical for the integrity of the  estimated impairment provisions. Audit Procedures included but were not limited to the following: We started our audit procedures with understanding of the internal control environment  related to Impairment loss allowance. Our procedures over internal controls focused on  recognition and measurement of impairment loss allowance. We assessed the design  and tested the operating effectiveness of the selected key controls implemented by the  Company. We also assessed whether the impairment methodology used by the Company is in  accordance with the assumptions and methodology approved by the Board of Directors  of the Company which is based on and in compliance with Ind AS 109 “Financial  Instruments”. Accordingly, we assessed the approach of the Company regarding definition of Default,  Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and incorporation of forward -  looking information for the calculation of ECL. For loans and advances which are assessed  for impairment on a portfolio basis, we performed particularly the following procedures: •   We read the Company’s policies for identification, classification and assessing  compliance for Stage 3/NPAs customers in line with the IRAC norms; •   We understood the design, reliability and operating effectiveness of key data inputs  and related management controls; •   We performed substantial audit procedure relating to identification and classification  of Stage 3/NPAs by the Company. •   We tested the identification/ grouping of the loan accounts mapped with the  customer code as identified by the management; •   We performed analytical procedures to identify possible cases of evergreening of  loans and tested these on sample basis. •   We checked the stage classification as at the balance sheet date as per the definition  of Default of the Company and Reserve Bank of India circulars issued from time to  time; •   We validated the ECL Model and its calculation by involving our Information  Technology Expert; •   We have checked on sample basis that the stage classification for the borrowers has  been given in accordance with the Resolution Framework issued by Reserve Bank  of India (the “RBI”) and the Board approved policy for ECL provisioning and stage  classification with respect to such accounts; •   We have verified whether the ECL provision is made in accordance with the Board  Approved Policy in this regard; •   We have also calculated the ECL provision manually for selected samples; •   We have assessed the assumptions made by the Company in making accelerated  provision considering forward looking information. For loans and advances which are written off during the year under audit, we read and  understood the methodology and policy laid down and implemented by the Company in  this regard along with its compliance on sample basis.

we have performed, we conclude that there is a material  misstatement of this other information, we are required  to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this  regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with  Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements 7.   The accompanying Standalone Financial Statements  have been approved by the Company’s Management and  Board of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors  is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of  the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation  of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a  true and fair view of the standalone financial position,  standalone financial performance including other  comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash  flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS  specified under section 133 of the Act, RBI Guidelines  and other accounting principles generally accepted in  India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the  provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of  the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds  and other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and  estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls, that were operating effectively  for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements  that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 8.   In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the  Management and the Board of Directors are responsible  for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related  to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless the Management and the Board of  Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to  cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do  so. 9.   The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing  the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements 10.   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as  a whole are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on  Auditing will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or  error and are considered material if, individually or  in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. 11.   As part of an audit in accordance with Standards  on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the  Act we exercise professional judgment and maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: •    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement   of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control; •    Obtain an understanding of internal financial  control relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act  we are also responsible for expressing our opinion  on the internal financial controls system with  reference to the Standalone Financial Statements  and the operating effectiveness of such controls  based on our audit; •     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates and related disclosures made by the  Board of Directors; •     Conclude on the appropriateness of the  management’s use of the going concern basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern. If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required to  draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related  disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements  or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our  opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may  cause the Company to cease to continue as a going  concern; INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT     (Contd.) 206 Annual Report 2024-25 

•    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the Standalone Financial Statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  Standalone Financial Statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation; and •     Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence  regarding the Standalone Financial Statements  of the Company to express an opinion on the  Standalone Financial Statements. 12.   We communicate with those charged with governance  of the Company regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit. 13.   We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 14.   From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements for the financial year ended March  31, 2025 and are therefore the Key Audit Matters. We  describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless  law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication. Other Matter 15.   The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company  for the year ended March 31, 2024 were audited by  the predecessor joint auditors, who have expressed an  unmodified opinion as relevant on those Standalone  Financial Statements vide their audit report dated April  26, 2024. Accordingly, we do not express any opinion  on the figures reported in the standalone financial  statements for the year ended as at March 31, 2024.

ANNEXURE II   TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  Annexure II to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even  date to the members of Shriram Finance Limited on the  Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March  31, 2025 Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal financial  controls with reference to the Standalone Financial  Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section  143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)  (Referred to in paragraph 18(f) under ‘Report on Other  Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report  of even date)  1.   In conjunction with our audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements of Shriram Finance Limited (the  “Company”) as at and for the year ended March 31,  2025, we have audited the internal financial controls  with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of the  Company as at that date.  Management’s Responsibilities for Internal Financial  Controls 2.   The Company’s Management is responsible for  establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based on the internal financial controls with reference  to Standalone Financial Statements criteria established  by the Company considering the essential components  of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial  Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These  responsibilities include the design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that  were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of the Company’s business, including  adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding  of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and  errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal  Financial Controls with Reference to Standalone Financial  Statements  3.   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s internal financial controls with reference to  Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance  Note and Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI  prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the  extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls  with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to  Standalone Financial Statements were established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects. 4.   Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls with reference to these Standalone  Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness.  Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to  Standalone Financial Statements includes obtaining an  understanding of such internal financial controls with  reference to these Standalone Financial Statements,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the Standalone Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error. 5.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls  with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Standalone Financial Statements  6.   A Company’s internal financial controls with reference  to Standalone Financial Statements is a process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes  in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A Company’s internal financial controls  with reference to Standalone Financial Statements  include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone  Financial Statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  218 Annual Report 2024-25 

expenditures of the Company are being made only in  accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  Company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the Standalone Financial Statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Standalone Financial Statements  7.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls with reference to Standalone Financial  Statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to Standalone  Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial controls with reference  to Standalone Financial Statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the  degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion 8.   In our opinion, to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, the Company  has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial  controls with reference to Standalone Financial  Statements and such controls were operating effectively  as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal financial  controls with reference to Standalone Financial  Statements criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

6. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The material accounting policies related to preparation of the standalone financial statements are given below: 6.1     Financial instruments Initial recognition I) Classification of financial instruments The classification depends on the contractual terms of the cash flows of the financial assets and the Company’s business  model for managing financial assets which are explained below:    a)   Business model assessment         The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets  to achieve its business objective. The Company’s business model is not assessed on an instrument by instrument  basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:       •     How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are  evaluated and reported to the Company’s key management personnel.       •     The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business  model) and the way those risks are managed.        •     How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair  value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).       •     The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Company’s assessment.  The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress  case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the  Company’s original expectations, the Company does not change the classification of the remaining financial  assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or  newly purchased financial assets going forward.       •     At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Company determines whether newly recognised financial assets  are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect the commencement of a new business model.  The Company reassesses its business models each reporting period to determine whether the business models  have changed since the preceding period.          For the current and prior reporting periods, the Company has not identified a change in its business model.    b)   The Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) test         As a second step of its classification process, the Company assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to  identify whether they meet the SPPI test.         Principal for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may  change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the  premium/ discount).         In making this assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic  lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic  lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms  introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial  asset is classified and measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL    STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) STANDALONE ACCOUNTS 229 Shriram Finance Limited 

    The Company classifies its financial instruments into the following measurement categories:   (1)   Financial assets measured at amortised cost       These financial assets comprise bank balances, loans, trade receivables, other receivables, investments and other  financial assets.      Debt instruments         Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost where they have:       i)     contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specified dates, that represent solely payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding; and       ii)   are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by holding to collect contractual cash flows.         These debt instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently  measured at amortised cost. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are initially  measured at transaction price.   (2)   Financial assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)      Debt instruments       Investments in debt instruments are measured at FVTOCI where they have:       i)     contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specified dates, that represent solely payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding; and       ii)     are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets.         These debt instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently  measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in Other Comprehensive Income  (OCI) within a separate component of equity. Impairment losses or reversals, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and  losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in  OCI is reclassified from equity to the statement of profit and loss. As at the reporting date, the Company does not have any  debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.      Equity instruments         Investment in equity instruments that are neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by the Company in  a business combination to which Ind AS 103 - Business Combination applies, are measured at FVTOCI, where an irrevocable  election has been made by management and when such instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 - Financial  Instruments: Presentation. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Amounts presented in  OCI are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profit and loss. Dividends on such investments are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.   (3)    Financial assets measured at FVTPL         Financial instruments held at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction costs recognised in the statement  of profit and loss as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and any gains or losses are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss as they arise.         Items measured at FVTPL comprise:     i)   Investments (including equity shares) held for trading:        Financial instruments held for trading            A financial instrument is classified as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred principally for selling or repurchasing  in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is  evidence of short-term profit taking, or it is a derivative not in a qualifying hedge relationship.         Trading securities are classified as held for trading and recognised at FVTPL.        Equity Investments           Investment in Associate is carried at cost in the separate financial statements as permitted under Ind AS 27 - Separate  Financial Statements. The Company has accounted for its investment in subsidiary at fair value at the time of acquisition  due to business combination. The investment is subsequently measured at cost. All other equity investments except  those measured at FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL.  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 230 Annual Report 2024-25 

    ii)   Items specifically designated as FVTPL on initial recognition        Financial liability designated at FVTPL           A financial liability may be designated at FVTPL if it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch or:         •   if a host contract contains one or more embedded derivatives; or         •     if financial assets and liabilities are both managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance  with a documented risk management or investment strategy.     iii)   Debt instruments with contractual terms that do not represent solely payments of principal and interest.   (4)   Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL         The Company classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through  the profit and loss or is required to measure liabilities at FVTPL such as derivative liabilities.         Where a financial liability is designated at FVTPL, the movement in fair value attributable to changes in the Company’s  own credit quality is calculated by determining the changes in credit spreads above observable market interest rates  and is presented separately in OCI. As at the reporting date, the Company has not designated any financial liability as  measured at FVTPL.   (II)    Derivatives       A derivative is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:         •     Its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price,  foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided that, in the  case of a non-financial variable, it is not specific to a party to the contract (i.e. the underlying).         •     It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other  types of contracts expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.         •   It is settled at a future date.         The Company enters into derivative transactions with various counterparties to hedge its foreign currency risks and  interest rate risks. Derivative transaction consists of hedging of foreign exchange transactions, which includes interest  rate and currency swaps, interest rate options and forwards. The Company undertakes derivative transactions for  hedging on-balance sheet liabilities.           Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their  fair value is negative. The notional amount and fair value of such derivatives are disclosed separately. Changes in the fair  value of derivatives are included in net gain on fair value changes.      Hedge accounting     The Company has adopted hedge accounting. The Company makes use of derivative instruments to manage exposures to  interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. In order to manage particular risks, the Company applies hedge accounting for  transactions that meet specified criteria. The Company has formally designated and documented the hedge relationship to  which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking  the hedge. The documentation includes the Company’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge, the  hedging/ economic relationship, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, hedge ratio and how  the Company would assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to  changes in the hedged item’s cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in  achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are assessed on an on-going basis to determine that they actually have been  highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.      Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted as follows:  Cash flow hedge         A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with  a recognised asset or liability and could affect the statement of profit and loss. For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges,  the effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is initially recognised directly in OCI as cash  flow hedge reserve. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately as finance  cost in the statement of profit and loss. When the hedged cash flow affects the statement of profit and loss, the effective portion  of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or expense line of the statement of  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL    STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) STANDALONE ACCOUNTS 231 Shriram Finance Limited 

profit and loss. When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the  criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss that has been recognised in OCI at that time remains in OCI and is  recognised when the hedged forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of profit and loss. When a forecast  transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in OCI is immediately transferred to  the statement of profit and loss.   (III)    Debt securities and other borrowed funds         After initial measurement, debt issued and other borrowed funds are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised  cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on issue funds, and transaction costs that are an integral  part of the Effective Interest Rate (EIR).   (IV)   Reclassification of financial assets and liabilities         The Company does not reclassify its financial assets subsequent to their initial recognition. Financial liabilities are never  reclassified. The Company did not reclassify any of its financial assets or liabilities during the year ended March 31, 2025,  though there may be regrouping of financial assets or liabilities.   (V)   Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities      a)   Recognition         (1)     Loans and advances are initially recognised when the funds are transferred to the customer’s account or delivery of  assets by the dealer, whichever is earlier.          (2)   Investments are initially recognised on the settlement date.         (3)   Debt securities, deposits and borrowings are initially recognised when funds reach the Company.             Other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Company  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way trades: purchases or  sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or  convention in the market place.       b)   Derecognition of financial assets due to substantial modification of terms and conditions             The Company derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been  renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as derecognition gain  or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised loans are classified  as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless the new loan is deemed to be Purchased or Originated as Credit  Impaired (POCI).           If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result in  derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Company records a modification  gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.      c)   Derecognition of financial assets other than due to substantial modification        (1)   Financial  assets       A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets)  is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The Company  also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for  derecognition.           The Company has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either:             i.     The Company has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset,  or             ii.     It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows  in full without material delay to a third party under a pass–through arrangement.               Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Company retains the contractual rights to receive the  cash flows of a financial asset (the original asset), but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to  one or more entities (the eventual recipients), when all of the following three conditions are met:             i.     The Company has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has  collected equivalent amounts from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with  the right to full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 232 Annual Report 2024-25 

            ii.     The Company cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual  recipients.             iii.     The Company has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients  without material delay. In addition, the Company is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows,  except for investments in cash or cash equivalents including interest earned, during the period  between the collection date and the date of required remittance to the eventual recipients.           A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either:             i.   The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or             ii.     The Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the  asset, but has transferred control of the asset.                 The Company considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to sell the  asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without imposing  additional restrictions on the transfer.              When the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has retained  control of the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement,  in which case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability  are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. Interest income on  such assets is recognised as per policy as explained in note 6.2(I).              On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount (measured at the  date of derecognition) and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability  assumed) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Accordingly, gain or loss on sale or derecognition of  assigned portfolio are recorded upfront in the statement of profit and loss as per Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments.  Also, the Company recognises servicing income as a percentage of interest spread over tenure of loan in cases  where it retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset. As per the guidelines of RBI, the Company  is required to retain certain portion of the loan assigned to parties in its books as Minimum Retention Requirement  (MRR). Therefore, it continues to recognise the portion retained by it as MRR.       (2)   Financial liabilities   A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an  existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an  existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original  liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability  and the consideration paid is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. As at the reporting date, the Company does  not have any financial liabilities which have been derecognised.    (VI)    Impairment of financial assets a)   Overview of the ECL principles            The Company records allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other financial assets not held at FVTPL in  this section all referred to as financial instruments. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under Ind AS 109  - Financial Instruments.           The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime expected credit  loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based  on the 12-months expected credit loss.           Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial  instrument. The 12-months ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that result from default events  on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.           Both Lifetime ECLs and 12-months ECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending  on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments. The Company has grouped its loan portfolio into  commercial vehicles, construction equipment, farm equipment, passenger vehicles, gold loan, personal loans, MSME  secured, MSME unsecured, two wheeler and loans to NBFC.           The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a  financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the  risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Company does the assessment of  significant increase in credit risk at a borrower level. If a borrower has various facilities having different past due status,  then the highest Days Past Due (DPD) is considered to be applicable for all the facilities of that borrower.

        Based on the above, the Company categorises its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:        Stage 1            All exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that has low credit  risk at the reporting date and that are not credit impaired upon origination are classified under this stage. The Company  classifies all standard advances and advances upto 30 days default under this category. Stage 1 loans also include facilities  where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2 or Stage 3.        Stage 2           All exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit impaired  are classified under this stage. 30 Days Past Due is considered as significant increase in credit risk.        Stage  3             All exposures assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated  future cash flows of that asset have occurred are classified in this stage. For exposures that have become credit impaired, a  lifetime ECL is recognised and interest revenue is calculated by applying the EIR to the amortised cost (net of provision)  rather than the gross carrying amount. 90 Days Past Due is considered as default for classifying a financial instrument  as credit impaired. If an event (for example, any natural calamity) warrants a provision higher than as mandated under  ECL methodology, the Company may classify the financial asset in Stage 3 accordingly.            As required by Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Company-Scale based regulation)  Directions, 2023 RBI/DoR/2023-24/106 DoR.FIN.REC.No.45/03.10.119/2023-24 dated October 19, 2023 as amended,  where impairment allowance under Ind AS 109 is lower than the provisioning required as per extant prudential norms on  Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) including borrower/ beneficiary wise classification,  provisioning for standard as well as restructured assets, NPA ageing, etc., the Company shall appropriate the difference  from their net profit or loss after tax to a separate impairment reserve.           Borrower accounts shall be flagged as overdue as part of the day-end processes for the due date, irrespective of the time  of running such processes. Similarly, classification of borrower accounts as Non-Performing Asset (NPA)/ Stage 3 shall  be done as part of day-end process for the relevant date i.e. 90 Days Past Due and NPA/ Stage 3 classification date shall  be the calendar date for which the day end process is run. In other words, the date of NPA/ Stage 3 shall reflect the asset  classification status of an account at the day end of that calendar date.            Upgradation of accounts classified as Stage 3/ NPA - The Company upgrades loan accounts classified as Stage 3/ NPA  to standard asset category only if the entire arrears of interest, principal and other amount are paid by the borrower  and there is no change in the accounting policy followed by the Company in this regard. With regard to upgradation of  accounts classified as NPA due to restructuring, the instructions as specified for such cases as per the said RBI guidelines  shall continue to be applicable.        ( 1)   Credit impaired financial assets              At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial  assets carried at FVTOCI are credit impaired. A financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that  have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.           Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the following observable data:     a)   Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;     b)   A breach of contract such as a default or past due event;     c)     The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider  otherwise;     d)   It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;     e)   Repossession of security or      f)   The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.         (2)   ECL on investment in Government Securities       The Company has invested in Government of India loans. Investment in Government securities are classified  under stage 1. No ECL has been applied on these investments as there is no history of delay in servicing of interest/  repayments. The Company does not expect any delay in interest/redemption servicing in future.         (3)   ECL on Pass Through Certificates (PTC)       The Company recognises the ECL on PTC on a collective basis by taking into account comprehensive credit risk  information and is computed in similar manner as loans measured at amortised cost. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 234 Annual Report 2024-25 

        (4)   ECL on loans secured by the Company’s fixed deposit       No ECL has been applied on loans given against the Company’s fixed deposit as they are fully secured by the  Company’s fixed deposits.    (5)   ECL on Fixed Deposits with Banks       No ECL has been applied on fixed deposits held with banks as there is no history of default. However, in case of  any downgrade in the credit rating of the banks where fixed deposit is held, the Company would provide for ECL  computed in an appropriate methodology.   From March 2025, ECL on fixed deposits with banks is determined  using rates from established sources.   (6)   Simplified approach for trade/ other receivables and contract assets        The Company follows simplified approach for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade/ other receivables  that do not contain a significant financing component. The application of simplified approach does not require the  Company to track changes in credit risk.  It recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each  reporting date, right from its initial recognition. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are  updated for changes in the forward-looking estimates. For trade receivables that contain a significant financing  component a general approach is followed.   (7)   ECL on debt instruments measured at FVTOCI         The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVTOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these financial assets  in the balance sheet, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if  the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an accumulated impairment amount, with a  corresponding charge to the statement of profit and loss. The accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the  statement of profit and loss upon derecognition of the assets. As at the reporting date, the Company does not have  any debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.   (8)   ECL on Undrawn loan commitments         When estimating ECL for undrawn loan commitments, a credit conversion factor of 100% is applied for expected  drawdown. The Company discloses ECL allowance on undrawn loan commitments under the head Provisions  under non-financial liabilities.      b)   The mechanics of ECL           The Company calculates ECLs based on probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls,  discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to the  Company in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive.         The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are as follows:        (1)   Probability of Default (PD)          The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only  happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in  the portfolio. The concept of PD is further explained in note 56.02.02.02.        (2)   Exposure at Default (EAD)          The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date. The concept of EAD is further  explained in note 56.02.02.03.        (3)   Loss Given Default (LGD)          The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based  on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Company would expect to receive,  including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD. The concept of  LGD is explained in note 56.02.02.04.   (4)   Forward looking information              While estimating the expected credit losses, the Company identifies the key macro-economic factors (independent  variables) basis the R-square and the economic relationship between the independent variable and the default rates  and the most relevant macro-economic factor affecting the particular loan product is factored in while arriving at  the PD of that product.             On a periodic basis, the Company monitors the situation and economic factors affecting the operations of the  Company and assesses the requirement of any modification to ECL model.

  (5)   Stress testing               The Company formulated three different macro-economic stress scenarios under the premise of mild stress,  medium stress and severe stress condition. The medium stress scenario largely reflected the current economic  conditions, and accordingly was used for ECL purpose.   (6)   Collateral repossessed               In its normal course of business whenever default occurs, the Company may take possession of properties or other  assets in its retail portfolio and generally disposes such assets through auction, to settle outstanding debt. Any  surplus funds are returned to the customers/ obligors. The Company generally does not use the assets repossessed  for the internal operations. The underlying loans in respect of which collaterals have been repossessed and not sold  for more than 6 months are considered as Stage 3 assets and fully provided for net of estimated realisable value or  written off. As a result of this practice, assets under legal repossession processes are not recorded on the balance  sheet as it does not meet the recognition criteria in other standards and consequently the Company also does not  derecognise the underlying financial asset immediately on repossession.   (7)   Restructured loans             The Company is permitted to restructure customer accounts. Restructuring would normally involve modification  of terms of the advances/ securities, which would generally include, among others, alteration of payment period,  payable amount, the amount of instalments, rate of interest, sanction of additional credit facility or release of  additional funds for a customer account. The Company considers the modification of the loan only before the loans  gets credit impaired. In case of restructuring, the accounts classified as standard shall be immediately downgraded  as NPA/ Stage 3 unless and other wise explicitly stated in the circulars and directions issued by RBI from time to  time. Once an asset has been classified as restructured, it will remain restructured for a period of one year from the  date on which it has been restructured until the customer account demonstrates satisfactory performance during  the specified period.             For upgradation of accounts classified as NPA due to restructuring, the instructions as specified for such cases as  per the said RBI guidelines shall continue to be applicable.             Loan accounts which have been restructured or modified in accordance with RBI Notifications - RBI/2020-21/16  DOR. No.BP.BC/3/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 06, 2020- Resolution Framework for COVID-19 related  Stress and RBI/2021-22/31/DOR.STR.REC.11/21.04.048/2021-22 dated May 05, 2021- Resolution Framework  – 2.0: Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Individuals and Small Businesses and RBI/2020-21/17 DOR.  No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020-21- dated August 06, 2020 - Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector  – Restructuring of Advances and  RBI/2021-22/32 DOR.STR.REC.12/21.04.048/2021-22 dated May 5, 2021  Resolution Framework 2.0 – Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises  (MSMEs) have been classified as Stage 2 due to significant increase in credit risk.     (VII)   Write-offs           The Company reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when the Company has no reasonable expectations  of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Company determines  that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to repay the  amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are accounted under bad debt recovery  disclosed under other operating income. Write off in case of standard accounts is done by way of waiver of last one or  two instalments in case the borrower pays all the EMIs as per the due dates mentioned in the agreement.     (VIII)   Determination of fair value   On initial recognition, all the financial instruments are measured at fair value. For subsequent measurement, the  Company measures certain categories of financial instruments [as explained in note 6.1(I)(1) to 6.1(I)(3)] at fair value  on each balance sheet date.   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the  transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:     i.   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or     ii.   In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.   The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.      The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when  pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 236 Annual Report 2024-25 

  A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic  benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset  in its highest and best use.   The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are  available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable  inputs.   In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation  techniques as summarised below:   Level 1 -  Those financial instruments where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active  markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at the measurement date. The Company considers  markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical  assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date.   Level 2 -  Those financial instruments where the inputs that are used for valuation are significant and are derived from  directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs include  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets  and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit  spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it  relates to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable  inputs which are significant to the entire measurement, the Company will classify the instruments as Level 3.   Level 3 -  Those financial instruments that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the measurement  as whole.   The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during  which the change has occurred. No such instances of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy were recorded  during the reporting period.     Difference between transaction price and fair value at initial recognition   The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair  value of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with  other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based  on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. When such evidence exists, the  Company recognises the difference between the transaction price and the fair value in profit or loss on initial recognition  (i.e. on day one).   When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on  a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Company recognises the difference  between the transaction price and fair value in net gain on fair value changes. In those cases where fair value is based on  models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value  is deferred and is only recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the inputs become observable, or when the  instrument is derecognised. 6.2   Revenue from operations   (I)   Interest income         Interest income is recognised by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial assets measured at amortised  cost other than credit impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at FVTPL.       The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed          a.     As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset  to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.          b.   By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.         c.     Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the EIR, transaction  costs, and all other premiums or discounts.           Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding  adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL    STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) STANDALONE ACCOUNTS 237 Shriram Finance Limited 

        Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the EIR to the net amortised cost (net of ECL  provision) of the financial asset.         Interest on delayed payments by customers are treated to accrue only on realisation, due to uncertainty of realisation  and are accounted accordingly.         Interest spread under par structure of direct assignment of loan receivables is recognised upfront. On derecognition of  the loan receivables in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition)  and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) shall be recognised  upfront in the statement of profit and loss.   (II)   Dividend income       Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.   (III)   Rental income         Rental income arising from leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.  In cases where the increase  is in line with expected general inflation, rental income is recognised as per the contractual terms.    (IV)   Fees and commission income          Fees and commissions are recognised when the Company satisfies the performance obligation, at the amount of  transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation based on a five-step model as  set out below, unless included in the effective interest calculation:          Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that  creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met.         Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a  customer to transfer a good or service to the customer.         Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company  expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts  collected on behalf of third parties.         Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than  one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount  that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each  performance obligation.       Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.    (V)   Net gain/ (loss) on fair value changes          Any differences between the fair values of financial assets classified at FVTPL (refer note 34), held by the Company on  the balance sheet date is recognised as an unrealised gain/loss. In cases there is a net gain in the aggregate, the same  is recognised in net gain on fair value changes under revenue from operations and if there is a net loss the same is  disclosed under expenses in the statement of profit and loss .         Similarly, any realised gain or loss on sale of financial instruments measured at FVTPL and debt or equity instruments  measured at FVTOCI is recognised in net gain/ loss on fair value changes. As at the reporting date, the Company does  not have any debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.    (VI)   Recoveries of financial assets written off       The Company recognises income on recoveries of financial assets written off on realisation basis. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 238 Annual Report 2024-25 

  (VII)   Net gain/ loss on derecognition of financial instruments under amortised cost category         In case where transfer of a part of financial assets qualifies for derecognition, any difference between the proceeds  received on such sale and the carrying value of the transferred asset is recognised as gain or loss on derecognition of  such financial asset previously carried under amortisation cost category is presented separately under the respective  head in the statement of profit and loss. The resulting interest only strip initially is recognised at FVTPL under interest  income.     (VIII)   Other incomes       All other incomes are recognised in the period they occur. 6.3    Expenses    (I)    Finance costs         Finance costs represents interest expense recognised by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial liabilities  other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL.       The EIR in case of a financial liability is computed    a.     As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability  to the gross carrying amount of the amortised cost of a financial liability.    b.   By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.    c.     Including all fees paid between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the EIR, transaction costs, and all  other premiums or discounts.       Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest expense with the corresponding  adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial liability.     Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognised as part of the carrying value of the financial liability and  amortised over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable to advisers  and other expenses such as external legal costs, rating fee etc., provided these are incremental costs that are directly related to  the issue of a financial liability. (II)   Retirement and other employee benefits    a)   Short term employee benefit           All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term  employee benefits. These benefits include short term compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The  undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered  by employees is recognised as an expense during the period. Benefits such as salaries and wages, etc. and the  expected cost of the bonus/ ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related  service.    b)   Post-employment employee benefits         (1)   Defined contribution schemes             All the employees of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the Provident Fund and Employees  State Insurance scheme, defined contribution plans in which both the employee and the Company contribute  monthly at a stipulated rate. The Company has no liability for future benefits other than its annual contribution  and recognises such contributions as an expense in the period in which employee renders the related service.  If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the  contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received  before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead  to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.

       (2)   Defined benefit schemes             The Company provides for the gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering all employees. The plan  provides for lump sum payments to employees upon death while in employment or on separation from  employment after serving for the stipulated years mentioned under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The  present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plan is determined based on actuarial valuation,  carried out by an independent actuary at each balance sheet date, using the Projected Unit Credit Method,  which recognises each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of employee benefit entitlement  and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.               The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for  determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on  government securities as at the balance sheet date.                Net interest recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss is calculated by applying the discount rate used to  measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability or asset. The actual return on the  plan assets above or below the discount rate is recognised as part of re-measurement of net deﬁned liability or  asset through OCI. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, attrition rate, future salary  increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature,  these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed annually.             The Company fully contributes all ascertained liabilities to the Trustees - Shriram Finance Limited Employees  Group Gratuity Assurance Scheme. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust and contributions are  invested in a scheme of insurance with the IRDA approved insurance companies.              Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts  included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet  with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur.  They are not reclassiﬁed to the statement of proﬁt and loss in subsequent periods.   (i)   Other long-term employee benefits         Company’s liabilities towards compensated absences to employees are accrued on the basis of valuations, as at the  balance sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial gains and losses  comprise experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and are recognised immediately in  the statement of profit and loss.       The Company presents the provision for compensated absences under provisions in the balance sheet.    (ii)    Employee share-based payment       a)   Employee Stock Options           Eligible employees in terms of the Employees Stock Options Scheme of the Company receive remuneration in  the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments  (equity-settled transactions).            The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an  appropriate valuation model.           That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in share option outstanding reserves in equity, over  the period in which the performance and/ or service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense/ vesting  period. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting  date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of  equity instruments that will ultimately vest. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 240 Annual Report 2024-25 

         The statement of profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense  recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expenses. No expense  is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.       b)   Share appreciation rights (SAR) (cash-settled)           The cost of cash-settled scheme (stock appreciation rights) is measured initially using fair value method at the  grant date taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. This fair  value is amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with recognition of corresponding liability. This  liability is re-measured at each Balance Sheet date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in ‘Share-based payment to employees’ under the head Employee  Benefit Expense.   (III)   Leases    a)   The Company as a lessee           The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 - Leases with the date of initial application being April 01, 2019 (transition  date). The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the  arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a  specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A contract is, or contains, a lease  if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a consideration.   The Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a lease or not lease. For arrangements  entered into prior to April 01, 2019, the Company has determined whether the arrangement contains a lease on the  basis of facts and circumstances existing on the date of transition.           The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use  asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease  payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs  to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located,  less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method  from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.           The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the transition date in case  of leases existing as on the date of transition date and in case of leases entered after transition date, incremental  borrowing rate as on the date of lease commencement date. In case of existing leases, the said date would be the  date of transition. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in a rate,  if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option.            When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of  the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in statement of profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset  has been reduced to zero.           The Company has opted not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have  a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments  associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The Company’s lease asset class consist of leases for  office premises .          In case of a sub-lease, the Company accounts for its head lease and sub-lease separately.      b)   The Company as a lessor             Rental income arising from leases is recognised on a straight line basis in the statement of profit and loss over the  lease term. In cases where the increase is in line with expected general inflation, rental income is recognised as per  the contractual terms.

  (IV)   Other expenses       All other expenses are accounted in the period they are incurred.   (V)   Impairment of non-financial assets, wherever applicable         The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset may be  impaired due to events or changes in circumstances indicating that their carrying amounts may not be realised. If  any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. If such recoverable amount of  the asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is  treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is  an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the  asset is reflected at the revised recoverable amount, subject to maximum of the depreciated historical cost.   (VI)   Taxes      a)   Current tax           Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered  from, or paid to, the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that  are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and  generates taxable income.           Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised either in OCI  or equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which  applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.      b)   Deferred tax           Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets  and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have  been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred  income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.           Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is  probable that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets  are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax  benefit will be realised.           Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and  liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different  tax entities but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities  are realised simultaneously.      c)   Goods and Services Tax (GST) paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses         Expenses and assets are recognised net of the GST paid, except:         i.     When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in  which case the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense  item, as applicable.         ii.   When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included.           The net amount of tax recoverable from or payable to the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or  payables in the balance sheet.

  (VII) Dividends on ordinary shares         The Company recognises a liability to make cash distributions to equity shareholders of the Company when the  distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the Companies Act,  2013, the final dividend is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders and interim dividend is authorised when  it is approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 6.4   Foreign currency translation   (I)   Functional and presentational currency         The standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees which is also functional currency of the Company  and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.   (II)   Transactions and balances      a)   Initial recognition           Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the  dates of the transactions.      b)   Conversion           Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, which are outstanding as at the reporting date, are  translated at the reporting date at the closing exchange rate and the resultant exchange differences are recognised  in the statement of profit and loss.           Non–monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot  exchange rates as at the date of recognition. 6.5   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalents comprise the net amount of short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible  to known amounts of cash (short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less) and are subject to an  insignificant risk of change in value, cheques on hand and balances with banks. They are held for the purposes of meeting  short-term cash commitments (rather than for investment or other purposes).     For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cheques on hand, balances  with banks (of the nature of cash and cash equivalents), CBLO and short- term deposits, as defined above. 6.6   Property, plant and equipment     Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are carried at historical cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and  accumulated impairment losses, (if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and  any other incidental expenses directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be  capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by  changing the depreciation period or methodology, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.     Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future benefits  of the existing asset, if it is probable that future economic benefit will flow to the Company from that expenditure and cost  can be measured reliably. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred.   (I)   Depreciation         Depreciation is calculated using the straight–line method to write down the cost of PPE to their residual values over  their estimated useful lives which is in line with the estimated useful life as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act,  2013 except for leasehold improvements which are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of lease or estimated  period of useful life of such improvement, subject to a maximum period of 60 months. Leasehold improvements include  all expenditure incurred on the leasehold premises that have future economic benefits. Land is not depreciated. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL    STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) STANDALONE ACCOUNTS 243 Shriram Finance Limited 

      The estimated useful lives are as follows: Particulars Useful life as prescribed by  Schedule II of the Companies Act,  2013 Useful life estimated by  Company Building 60 years  60 years  Plant and machinery 15 years 15 years Electrical equipment 10 years 10 years Generator  10 years 10 years Furniture and fixture 10 years  10 years  Air conditioner  5 years  5 years  Electronic equipment  5 years  5 years  Office equipment 5 years  5 years  Refrigerator  5 years  5 years  Motor car 8 years  8 years  Vehicles  10 years  10 years  Server and networking  6 years  6 years  Computer  3 years 3 years     Exceptions to useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013:     The vehicles provided to employees as part of Cost-To-Company (CTC) scheme are depreciated using estimated useful  life of 8 years without residual value.     The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of PPE are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate.     PPE is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising  on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of  the asset) is recognised in other income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss in the year the asset is derecognised.      Depreciation on assets acquired/ sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the statement of profit and loss  from/ upto the date of acquisition/ sale or disposal.     The date of disposal of an item of PPE is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the  requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with  Customers. 6.7   Intangible assets     An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future  economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Company.     Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises its  purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of any trade  discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation  and any accumulated impairment losses.     The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised  over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite  useful life are reviewed at least at each balance sheet date. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of  consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period  or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on  intangible assets with finite lives is presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit and loss. Amortisation on assets  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 244 Annual Report 2024-25 

acquired/ sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the statement of profit and loss from/ upto the date of  acquisition/ sale.     The Company’s intangible assets consist of computer software and distribution network with finite life and goodwill with  indefinite life.      Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values  over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets comprising of software are amortised on a straight line basis over a period  of 3 years, unless it has a shorter useful life.     Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated  impairment losses. The Company has determined the useful life of distribution network acquired through the scheme of  amalgamation and started amortising the same over its useful life of 5 years.      Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and  the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. 6.8   Intangible assets under development    Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of balance sheet are disclosed as Intangible assets under  development.  These are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses.  6.9   Investment property     A property held to earn rentals and/ or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and reported  at cost, including transaction costs.      Depreciation is recognised using straight line method so as to write off the cost of the investment property less their residual  values over their useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or in case of assets where the useful life  was determined by technical evaluation, over the useful life so determined. Depreciation method is reviewed at each balance  sheet date to reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future benefits embodied in the investment property. The  estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed at each balance sheet date and the effect of any change in the  estimates of useful life/ residual value is accounted on prospective basis.      An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from  use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property is  recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the same period. 6.10   Ind AS 101 - First-time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards Exemptions applied     Ind AS 101 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under  Ind AS. The Company has applied the following exemptions:     On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and  equipment, intangible assets and investment property as at March 31, 2017 measured as per the previous GAAP and use  that carrying value as the deemed cost of the property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property as on  April 01, 2017.  6.11   Provisions     Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, and it  is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.      When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting the  expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any provision  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL    STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) STANDALONE ACCOUNTS 245 Shriram Finance Limited 

is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. As at reporting date, the Company does not have  any such provisions where the effect of time value of money is material. 6.12   Contingent liabilities     A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence  or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation  that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A  contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot  be measured reliably. The Company does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the ﬁnancial  statements. Contingent liabilities are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 6.13   Contingent assets   A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence  or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Contingent assets  are neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements. They are disclosed only when an inflow of economic benefits  is probable. Contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 6.14   Earnings per Share (EPS)     The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 - Earnings per Share. Basic EPS  is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference  dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders  and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential  equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period unless they have been  issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that  either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. 6.15   Statement of Cash Flows Cash flows are reported under the indirect method as set out in Ind AS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows, whereby net profit  after tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature, tax and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash  receipts or payments. The cash flows are prepared for the operating, investing and financing activities of the Company. 6.16   Business combination   The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations where common control does not  exist. The consideration transferred by the Company for the acquisition of business comprises of fair value of the assets  transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company as at the acquisition date i.e. the date on  which it obtains the control of the acquiree. The acquisition related costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as  incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.   Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on the  acquisition date.   Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their  fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets as well as goodwill acquired in a business  combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, respectively.   Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net  identifiable assets acquired. After initial recognition, goodwill is tested annually for impairment and any impairment loss for  goodwill is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 246 Annual Report 2024-25 

  Distribution network is the value of the transferor Company’s branch network. Valuation of Distribution Network is as per  With and Without Method. If the consideration transferred is less than the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired, the  difference is recognised as capital reserve in other equity. 6.17   Non-current assets held for sale   Non-current assets and disposable groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered  principally through a sale (rather than through continuing use) when the asset (or disposal Company) is available for  immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such asset (or disposal  group) and the sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the  date of classification except in some circumstances this period can be extended if it is beyond the control of management and  there are sufficient evidence that the entity remains committed to its plan to sell the asset. Non-current assets and disposal  groups classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.   An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain  is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative  impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current  asset is recognised at the date of derecognition.    Non-current assets are not depreciated or while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable  to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised. Non-current assets classified as held  for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held  for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet. 6.18   Exceptional items   Exceptional items are those items of income or expense from ordinary activities which are non-recurring and are of such  size, nature or incidence that their separate disclosure in the financial statements is considered necessary to explain the  performance of the Company.  7. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS       The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the  accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the management’s  best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the  outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods in which changes  are made and if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.       In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting  policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the  following notes: 7.1     Business model assessment       Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The  Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together  to achieve a particular business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including  how the performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance  of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company monitors  financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the  reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL    STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) STANDALONE ACCOUNTS 247 Shriram Finance Limited 

held. Monitoring is part of the Company’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for which the remaining  financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business  model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 7.2     Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities       The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial  valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in  the future. These include the determination of the discount rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed annually.  7.3     Fair value measurement       When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based  on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these  models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required  in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.  Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 7.4     Impairment of loans portfolio       The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement,  when determining  impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of  factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. It has been the Company’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when  necessary. The policy on impairment loss on loans and advances is disclosed in detail in note 6.1(VI). 7.5     Contingent liabilities and provisions other than impairment on loan portfolio        Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of  funds resulting from past operations or events and the amount of cash outflow can be reliably estimated. The timing of  recognition and quantification of the liability requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances,  which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed at each balance sheet date  and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances. 7.6     Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method       The Company’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income/ expense using a rate of return that represents the best  estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given/ taken and recognises the effect of  potentially different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments  and penalty interest and charges).       This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the  instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/ expense that are integral parts of the  instrument. 7.7     Estimating the incremental borrowing rate       The Company uses its Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the  Company would have to pay to for its incremental borrowings. 7.8     Other estimates These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc. The Company has determined the  useful life of the intangible asset in the nature of branch network acquired through the scheme of amalgamation and  started amortising the same over its useful life by making a suitable change in the accounting estimate.

The primary risks managed using  derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. The Company’s risk management strategy and how  it is applied to manage risk are explained in note 56. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments The Company designates its derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly  probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. At inception of designated  9 BANK BALANCE OTHER THAN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  ( Contd .) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 250 Annual Report 2024-25 

hedging relationships, the Company documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.  The Company also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including  whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other. There is  an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the terms of the cross currency swap  contract match that of the foreign currency borrowing (notional amount, interest payment dates, principal repayment date  etc.). The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the hedging  instruments is identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical  derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value  of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks.   Cash flow hedges   When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the  derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in other equity under ‘effective portion of cash flow hedges’. The effective  portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair  value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of  changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments There are no undesignated derivatives. Notes:   1)    The interest rate risk and exchange rate risk on the borrowings of the Company are managed using various derivative  instruments which are entered into from time to time. The risk management strategy and the use of derivatives are  explained  in  note  56  and  96.           2)    The Company has designated the interest rate derivatives which were entered to mitigate interest rate risks on its  external commercial bond, external commercial  borrowings, term loan from banks and institutions and non- convertible debentures as hedging instruments.

The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act,  1972. Under the act, employee who has completed five years of service is entitled to specific benefit. The level of benefits  provided depends on the employee’s length of service and last drawn salary. The fund is managed by third party fund  managers. Each year, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding in the gratuity plan. Such a review includes the asset-liability  matching strategy and investment risk management policy. This includes employing the use of annuities and longevity  swaps to manage the risks. The Board of Trustees decides contribution to be made by the Company based on the results  of this annual review. The trust is in process of investing entire funds in government securities through third party fund  managers and as on March 31, 2025, 84.35% funds are invested in government securities and balance 15.65% funds are  invested in money market and corporate debt instruments. The Board of Trustees aim to keep annual contributions of the  Company relatively stable at a level such that no plan deficits (based on valuation performed) will arise.  The following tables summarises the components of net beneﬁt expense recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss and  the funded status and amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the gratuity plan.

52 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS     The Company provides employee stock option scheme and share appreciation rights to its employees.  52.01: Employee stock option plan (ESOP Scheme) 52.01.01   About the plan   Shriram Finance Limited Employee Stock Options Scheme 2023 (No.1) [“SFL ESOS 2023(No.1)”] has been created in lieu  of the erstwhile SCUF ESOS 2013 to issue stock options to the eligible employees of the SCUF (“Transferor Company”)  taking into account the share exchange ratio as provided in terms of clause 3.36.1 of the approved Composite Scheme of  Arrangement and Amalgamation (“Scheme”). The objective of SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan is that the eligible employees  of the Transferor Company continue to enjoy the benefit of stock options upon becoming the employees of the Company  and to restore the value of options post amalgamation in the manner provided in terms of Clause 3.35.17 of the Scheme.  This SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan has been adopted on March 15, 2023 by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee  and Board of directors of the Company.  Details of the options issued under SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan is as follows: Particulars Number of  options As at April 01, 2023  2,126,875  Allotted during the year  1,365,534  Lapsed during the year  6,680  As at March 31, 2024  754,661  Allotted during the period upto share split  265,967  Lapsed during the period upto share split  3,260  As at January 09, 2025 (pre-split)  485,434  As at January 10, 2025 (post-split) [(Refer note 30(I)]  2,427,170  Allotted during the period after share split  89,995  Lapsed during the period after share split  2,985  As at March 31, 2025  2,334,190  The options shall vest in the hands of the option holder after a minimum period of 12 months from the date of grant of  option or such longer period as may be determined by the Committee subject to the condition that the option grantee  continues to be an employee of the Company and the performance or other conditions as may be determined by the  Committee. The maximum period of vesting shall be 5 years from the date of grant.  The period during which the options granted by the Transferor Company under SCUF ESOS 2013 plan were held by the  eligible employee shall be adjusted against the minimum vesting period. That is, the date of vesting under the SCUF ESOS  2013 plan shall be considered as the vesting date under SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan. The exercise price shall be Rs. 193.55 per fresh options under the SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan. The options vested shall be exercised within period of ten years from the vesting date. When exercisable, each option  is convertible into one equity share. Any option granted shall be exercisable according to the terms and conditions as  determined by the Scheme.

52.01.02: Fair value of the options granted   The Company has recorded employee share-based compensation expense relating to the SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) options on  the basis of fair value of erstwhile SCUF ESOS 2013 options. The fair value of the options granted is mentioned below as per vesting period. The fair value of the options is determined  using Black-Scholes model which takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option (time to maturity), the share  price as at the grant date and expected price volatility (standard deviation) of the underlying share, the expected dividend  yield and risk-free interest rate for the term of the option. Fair value and assumptions for the equity-settled grants under the SCUF ESOS 2013 plan is as under: Particulars Grant I Grant II Grant III Grant IV Grant V Grant VI Grant VII Grant VIII Grant date August 11,  2020 November  02, 2020 January  29, 2021 July 29,  2021 October  27, 2021 January  28, 2022 April 29,  2022 July 27,  2022 No. of options granted  300,221   300,030   315,396   302,601   303,270   301,582   599,800   28,913  Vesting date August 11,  2021 November  02, 2021 January  29, 2022 July 29,  2022 October  27, 2022 January  28, 2023 April 29,  2023 July 27,  2023 Exercise price (in Rs.)*  300.00   300.00   300.00   300.00   300.00   300.00   300.00   300.00  Fair value of option    (in Rs.)*  399.20   560.18   756.39   1,539.79   1,985.23   1,517.66   1,440.68   1,686.59  Input variables: Share price as on grant  date (in Rs.)*  661.80   822.75   1,018.70   1,814.10   2,257.45   1,787.90   1,708.60   1,949.95  Standard deviation  (volatility) 38.28% 44.52% 47.21% 27.52% 49.85% 53.76% 51.12% 49.47% Risk-free interest rate  5.85% 5.88% 6.20% 4.48% 4.82% 5.03% 5.51% 6.46% Time to maturity    (in years)  2   2   2   2   2   2   2   2  Expected dividend per  annum (in Rs.)  20.00   25.00   30.00    -      -      -      -      -    Dividend yield 3.00% 3.00% 3.00%   -      -      -      -      -    *Pre-split            52.01.03:  Rationale  for  the  variables  used             The variables used for calculating the fair values and their rationale are as follows:   a)     Share  Price           The latest available closing market price on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) date on which options are granted  under SCUF ESOS 2023 plan has been considered for the purpose of valuation. b)     Volatility           Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period. The  measure of volatility used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is the annualised standard deviation of the  continuously compounded rates of return on the stock over a period of time.   The period to be considered for volatility must be adequate to represent a consistent trend in the price movements.  Accordingly, the annualised volatility has been computed based on the share price data of past one year, from the date  of the valuation. The fair value is very sensitive to this variable. Higher the volatility, higher is the fair value. The rationale being, the  more volatile a stock is, the more is its potential to go up (or come down), and the more is the probability to gain from  the movement in the price. Accordingly, an option to buy a highly volatile stock is more valuable than the one to buy  a less volatile stock, since the probability of gaining is lesser in the latter case. 52 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS   ( Contd .)

52 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS   ( Contd .) c)     Risk-free  interest  rate            The risk-free interest rate being considered for the calculation is the interest rate applicable on government securities  having  10  year  maturity  period.           d)     Exercise  price           Exercise price of the options granted is as per SCUF ESOS 2023 plan.   e)    Time to maturity/ expected life of options     Time to maturity/ expected life of options is the period from the grant date to the date on which option is expected to  be exercised. The minimum life of share option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised  and maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised. Considering the deep discount on the market price i.e. 55% to 70%, it is expected that the options will be exercised in  1 year from the vesting date. As such the average expected life of options is considered at 2 years. 52.01.04: Effect of the employee share-based payment plans on the statement of profit and loss and on its financial position The Company has recorded employee share-based compensation cost of Rs. Nil in the statement of profit and loss for the  financial year ended March 31, 2025 (March 31, 2024: Rs. 9.17 crores).

Subsequently, the SARs have been granted under this scheme. The contractual life (which is  equivalent to the vesting and exercise period) of the SARs outstanding ranges from 2 to 5 years.     The objective of Shriram Finance PSAR Plan 2024 is to provide means to enable the Company to attract and retain  appropriate human talent, to motivate the employees/ directors with incentives and reward opportunities, to achieve  sustained growth of the Company and the creation of shareholders value by aligning the interests of the employees/  directors which will lead to long-term wealth creation, to create a sense of ownership and participation amongst the  employees/ directors or otherwise increase their proprietary interest and to provide additional deferred rewards to the  employees/ directors. Shriram Finance PSAR Plan 2024 is a cash-settled incentive scheme. The incentive is linked to the appreciation in the  market price of the equity shares of the Company over the tenure of the plan.           Details of Shriram Finance PSAR Plan 2024 are as follows: Particulars Number of SARs As at April 01, 2023   -    Granted during the year   -    As at March 31, 2024   -    Granted during the year  1,280,000  As at March 31, 2025  1,280,000  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 322 Annual Report 2024-25

54 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT       The Company maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risks inherent in the business which includes issued  equity capital, share premium and all other equity reserves attributable to equity holders of the Company.            As an NBFC, the RBI requires us to maintain a minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) consisting of Tier I  and Tier II capital of 15% of our aggregate risk weighted assets. Further, the total of our Tier II capital cannot exceed 100%  of our Tier I capital at any point of time. The capital management process of the Company ensures to maintain a healthy  CRAR at all the times. Refer note 67 and 94 for the Company’s capital ratios.         The primary objectives of the Company’s capital management policy are to ensure that the Company complies with  externally imposed capital requirements and maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support  its business and to maximise shareholder value.       The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it according to changes in economic conditions  and the risk characteristics of its activities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust  the amount of dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. No changes  have been made to the objectives, policies and processes from the previous years except those incorporated on account  of regulatory amendments. However, they are under constant review by the Board. The Company has complied with  the Annexure II of Master Direction - RBI/DoR/2023-24/106 DoR.FIN.REC.No.45/03.10.119/2023-24 on disclosure  requirements under Scale Based Regulation for NBFCs dated October 19, 2023 as amended. 55 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  55.01: Valuation principle     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the  principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price),  regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair  values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as explained in  material accounting policies of the year ended March 31, 2025.           55.02: Fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities     The following table shows an analysis of financial instruments recorded at fair value by level of the fair value hierarchy: As at March 31, 2025  (Rs. in crores)  Assets measured at fair value on a  recurring basis  Level-1   Level-2   Level-3   Total  Derivative financial instruments Forward contracts   -     (622.65)   -     (622.65) Currency swaps   -     334.21    -     334.21  Interest rate swaps   -     460.76    -     460.76  Cross currency interest rate swaps   -     67.27    -     67.27  Interest rate caps   -     10.50    -     10.50  Total derivative financial instruments    -     250.09    -     250.09  Financial assets held for trading  Mutual funds  10.01    -      -     10.01  Government securities  484.94    -      -     484.94  Equity instruments  110.81    -     27.67   138.48  Certificate of deposits - 4,038.09   -     4,038.09  Venture capital fund - 1.52   -     1.52  Total financial assets held for trading  605.76   4,039.61   27.67   4,673.04  Total assets measured at fair value on  a recurring basis   605.76   4,289.70   27.67   4,923.13  Assets measured at fair value on a  non-recurring basis Non-current assets and disposals held  for sale    -      -      -      -    Total assets measured at fair value on  a non-recurring basis    -      -      -      -    Total assets measured at fair value   605.76   4,289.70   27.67   4,923.13  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 324 Annual Report 2024-25

55.03: Valuation techniques     Fair values of financial assets, other than those which are subsequently measured at amortised cost, have been arrived  at as under:       Derivative financial instruments      Foreign exchange contracts include foreign exchange forward and swap contracts, interest rate swaps and over-the- counter foreign exchange options. These instruments are valued by either observable foreign exchange rates, observable  or calculated forward points and option valuation models. With the exception of contracts where a directly observable  rate is available which are disclosed as Level-1, the Company classifies derivative financial instruments as Level-2 financial  instruments when no unobservable inputs are used for their valuation or the unobservable inputs used are not significant  to the measurement (as a whole).      Investments in mutual funds/ equity instruments     Investment in units of mutual funds are measured based on their published Net Asset Value (NAV), taking into account  redemption and/ or other restrictions. Such instruments are generally Level 1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities are  initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured (to the extent information is available) and valued on a case-by- case and classified as Level-3. Quoted equity instruments on recognised stock exchanges are valued at Level-1 hierarchy  being the unadjusted quoted price as the reporting date.       Government securities      Investment in government securities held for trading are measured based on latest quoted price available at platform  notified by the regulator.    Certificate of Deposits (CDs)     Certificate of deposits are short-term financial instruments issued by banks. Financial Benchmark India Private Limited    (FBIL)  has developed the FBIL-CD, a new benchmark for the money market based on traded CDs reported on the  FIMMDA Trade Reporting and Confirmation System (FTRAC) platform of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL).  FBIL-CD is announced for seven tenors of 14 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. For  valuation, the Company uses FBIL-CD benchmark and based on that benchmark the Company interpolates and calculates  CD prices corresponding to their residual maturities and such instruments are classified as Level-2.    Venture capital fund     Investment in venture capital fund are measured based on net asset value basis. 55.04: Transfer between fair value hierarchy levels     During the financial year there were no transfers between Level-1 and Level-2.  55.05: Movements in Level-3 financial instruments measured at fair value     The following tables show a reconciliation of the opening and closing amounts of Level-3 financial assets and liabilities  which are recorded at fair value. Transfers from Level-3 to Level-2 occur when the market for some securities became  more liquid, which eliminates the need for the previously required significant unobservable valuation inputs. Since the  transfer, these instruments have been valued using valuation models incorporating observable market inputs. Transfers  into Level-3 reflect changes in market conditions as a result of which instruments become less liquid. Therefore, the  Company requires significant unobservable inputs to calculate their fair value. 55 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  ( Contd .)

The range of values indicates the highest and lowest level input  used in the valuation technique and, as such, only reflects the characteristics of the instruments as opposed to the level of  uncertainty to their valuation.

All  changes would be reflected in the statement of profit and loss. Sensitivity data are calculated using a number of techniques,  including analysing price dispersion of different price sources, adjusting model inputs to reasonable changes within the  fair value methodology.     The ranges are not comparable or symmetrical as the model inputs are usually not in the middle of the favourable/  unfavourable range.       The table below shows data in relation to Level-3 inputs that are already aggregated on the underlying product levels  without assuming any potential diversification effect, but including potential off-sets from economic or accounting hedge  relationships in place. The Company is of the opinion that, whilst there may be some diversification benefits, incorporating  these would not be significant to the analysis. 55 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  ( Contd .)

These fair values were calculated for  disclosure purposes only. The below methodologies and assumptions relate only to the instruments in the above tables.    Instruments with no comparable instruments or valuation inputs are classified as Level-3.    Short-term financial assets and liabilities     For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts,  which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such instruments include trade receivables,  other receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents (other than deposits with banks), trade payables, other  payables and other financial liabilities without a specific maturity.    Bank deposits and receivable from trusts on account of securitisation                  The fair value of bank deposits and receivable from trusts on account of securitisation has been determined using the  discounted cash flow method. The discount rates used are based on the prevailing interest rates offered by the State Bank  of India (SBI) for fixed deposits with comparable maturities as on the reporting date.     Loans and advances to customers              The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models based on contractual cash flows using  weighted average interest rates for the disbursements done during the last quarter of the financial year.      Pass  through  certificates             These instruments include asset backed securities. The market for these securities is not active. The fair values of pass  through certificates are estimated by discounted cash flow models based on contractual cash flows using weighted average  interest rates for the deals entered during the last quarter of the financial year.            Investment in associate at cost                 As per Ind AS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, interest in associate are recognised at cost and not adjusted  to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Cost represents amount paid for acquisition of the said investments.  The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period, if there are any indications that the said investments may be  impaired. If so, the Company estimates the recoverable value/ amount of the investment and provides for impairment, if  any i.e. the deficit in the recoverable value over cost.             55 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  ( Contd .)

   Investment  in  subsidiary             The Company has accounted for its investment in subsidiary at fair value at the time of acquisition due to business  combination. The investment is subsequently measured at cost till the date of sale (Refer note 43).    Investment in government securities at amortised cost              The fair values of held-to-maturity investments in government securities are measured based on latest quoted price  available at platform notified by the regulator.                Issued  debt  and  borrowings           The fair value of issued debt and borrowings is estimated by discounted cash flow models based on contractual cash flows  using weighted average interest rates for the deals entered into during the last quarter of the financial year.      Deposits            The fair value of public deposits and deposit from corporates is estimated by discounted cash flow models based on  contractual cash flows using weighted average interest rates for the deposits accepted during the last quarter of the financial  year.

This process  of risk management is critical to the Company’s continuing profitability and each individual within the Company is  accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Company is exposed to credit risk, liquidity  risk and market risk. It is also subject to various operating and business risks.  56.01:  Introduction and risk profile 56.01.01: Risk management structure     The Board of Directors are responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk management  strategies  and  principles.             The Board has constituted the Risk Management Committee (RMC) which is responsible for monitoring the overall  risk process within the Company. The RMC has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and  implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring  risk levels. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an  independent control process is maintained. The risk owners within each department will report to the RMC.      The risk owners are  responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the Company.  Each department has its risk owner who is responsible for the control of risks, including monitoring the actual risk of  exposures against authorised limits and the assessment of risks. The Company’s treasury is responsible for managing its  assets and liabilities and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of  the  Company.            The Company’s policy is that risk management processes throughout the Company are audited annually by the internal  audit function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Company’s compliance with the procedures.  Internal audit discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to  RMC.  55 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  ( Contd .)

56.01.02: Risk mitigation and risk culture     As part of its overall risk management, the Company can use derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures  resulting from changes in interest rates and foreign currencies associated with foreign currency transactions.  56.01.03: Risk measurement and reporting systems     The Company’s risks are measured using a method that reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances  and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss. The models make use of probabilities derived from  historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment, as necessary.     The Company’s policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk-bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure  across all risk types and activities.     Information compiled from all the departments is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify risks  on a timely basis. This information is presented and explained to the RMC and the head of each department.        The RMC receives a comprehensive risk report once a quarter which is designed to provide all the necessary information  to assess and conclude on the risks of the Company.     It is the Company’s policy to ensure that a robust risk awareness is embedded in its organisational risk culture. Employees  are expected to take ownership and be accountable for the risks the Company is exposed to that they decide to take on.  The Company’s continuous training and development emphasises that employees are made aware of the Company’s risk  appetite and they are supported in their roles and responsibilities to monitor and keep their exposure to risk within the  Company’s risk appetite limits. Compliance breaches and internal audit findings are important elements of employees  annual ratings and remuneration reviews.                56.01.04:  Excessive  risk  concentration             Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same  geographical region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be  similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.                  In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Company’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to  focus on spreading its lending portfolio across all the states with a cap on maximum limit of exposure for a state and also  for  an  individual/  group.         56.02:  Credit risk              Credit risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss because its customers or counterparties fail to discharge their  contractual obligations. The Company manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing  to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to  such limits.       Credit risk is monitored by the credit department of the Company. It is their responsibility to review and manage credit  risk, including environmental and social risk for all types of counterparties. Credit risk consists of line credit managers  who are responsible for their business lines and manage specific portfolios and experts who support both the line credit    manager, as well as the business with tools like credit risk systems, policies, models and reporting.     The Company has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the  creditworthiness of counterparties. The credit quality review process aims to allow the Company to assess the potential  loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective actions. The Company’s internal credit rating grades on days past due(dpd) basis: Internal rating grade Internal rating description Performing High grade 0 dpd Standard grade 1 to 30 dpd Sub-standard grade 31 to 60 dpd Past due but not impaired 61 to 89 dpd Non-performing 90 dpd and above 56 RISK MANAGEMENT  ( Contd .)

56.02.01: Derivative financial instruments Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as recorded  on the balance sheet. With gross-settled derivatives, the Company is also exposed to a settlement risk, being the risk that  the Company honours its obligation, but the counterparty fails to deliver the counter value. 56.02.02: Impairment assessment The references below show where the Company’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this  report. It should be read in conjunction with the summary of material accounting policies. The Company’s definition and assessment of default (Refer note 56.02.02.01).   -     How the Company defines, calculates and monitors the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given  default (Refer notes 56.02.02.02 to 56.02.02.04)              -     When the Company considers there has been a significant increase in credit risk of an exposure (Refer note  56.02.02.05).          -     The Company’s policy of segmenting financial assets where ECL is assessed on a collective basis (Refer note  56.02.02.07).          -     The details of the ECL calculations and categorisation of loans for stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 assets (Refer note  6.1(VI)).        56.02.02.01: Definition of default     The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in  all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.      As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances  that may indicate unlikeliness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should  result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether stage 2 is  appropriate. Such events include:        -   The borrower requesting emergency funding from the Company.       -     A material decrease in the underlying collateral value where the recovery of the loan is expected from the sale of  the collateral.       -   A covenant breach not waived by the Company.       -   The debtor (or any legal entity within the debtor’s Company) filing for bankruptcy application/ protection.       -   Repossession of security.       -     All the facilities of a borrower are treated as stage 3 when one of his facility becomes 90 days past due i.e. credit  impaired.       -     The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise. 56.02.02.02: Probability of Default (PD) estimation process                 It is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. PD estimation process is done based on historical  internal data available with the Company. While arriving at the PD, the Company also ensures that the factors that affects  the macro economic trends are considered to a reasonable extent, wherever necessary. The Company calculates the 12  month PD by taking into account the past historical trends of the portfolio and its credit performance. In case of assets  where there is a significant increase in credit risk, lifetime PD has been applied which is computed based on survival  analysis. For credit impaired assets, a PD of 100% has been applied. 56 RISK MANAGEMENT  ( Contd .) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL    STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) STANDALONE ACCOUNTS 333 Shriram Finance Limited 

56.02.02.03: Exposure at Default (EAD)             The exposure at default (EAD) represents the gross carrying amount of the financial instruments subject to the impairment  calculation, addressing both the ability to increase its exposure while approaching default and potential early repayments  too. To calculate the EAD for a stage 1 loan, the Company assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the  calculation of the 12 months ECL.  For stage 2 and stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the  instruments.   In case of undrawn loan commitments, a credit conversion factor of 100% is applied for expected drawdown.  56.02.02.04: Loss Given Default (LGD)         LGD is an estimate of the loss arising in case where a default occurs. It is based on the difference between the contractual  cash flows due and those that the Company would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any security. 56.02.02.05: Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)         The Company continuously monitors all assets subject to ECLs in order to determine whether an instrument or a portfolio  of instruments is subject to 12 month ECL or lifetime ECL. The Company assesses whether there has been an event which  could cause a significant increase in the credit risk of the underlying asset or the customers ability to pay and accordingly  change the 12 month ECL to a lifetime ECL.             In certain cases, the Company may also consider that events explained in note 56.02.02.01 are a significant increase in  credit risk as opposed to a default. Regardless of the above, if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, the  credit risk is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition.  When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a Company of similar assets (as set out in note 56.02.02.07), the  Company applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial  recognition.   56.02.02.06: Forward looking information         As explained in note 6.1(VI), the Company has incorporated forward looking information and macro-economic factors  while calculating PD and LGD rate. 56.02.02.07: Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis         As explained in note 6.1(VI), the Company calculates ECLs only on a collective basis. The Company segments the exposure  into smaller homogeneous portfolios, based on a combination of internal and external characteristics of the loans as given  below: 1.    Commercial vehicles      2.    Construction equipments   3.    Farm equipments   4.    Passenger vehicles    5.    Gold loans   6.    Personal loans 7.    MSME secured 8.    MSME unsecured 9.

Present and anticipated asset quality      2.    Present and future earnings capacity      3.    Historical funding requirements      4.    Current liquidity position      5.    Anticipated future funding needs, and      6.    Sources of funds.     The Company maintains a portfolio of marketable assets that are assumed to be easily liquidated and undrawn cash  credit limits which can be used in the event of an unforeseen interruption in cash flow. The Company also enters into  securitisation deals (direct assignment as well as pass through certificates) of their loan portfolio, the funding from which  can be accessed to meet liquidity needs. In accordance with the Company’s policy, the liquidity position is assessed under  a variety of scenarios, giving due consideration to stress factors relating to both the market in general and specifically to  the Company. Net liquid assets consist of cash, short-term bank deposits and investments in mutual fund available for  immediate sale, less issued securities and borrowings due to mature within the next month. Borrowings from banks and  financial institutions, issue of debentures and bonds and acceptance of public deposits are considered as important sources  of funds to finance lending to customers. They are monitored using the advances to borrowings ratio, which compares  loans and advances to customers as a percentage of secured and unsecured borrowings.     The Board of Directors approves constitution of Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). It reviews or monitors  Asset Liability Management (ALM) mismatch. It conducts periodic reviews relating to the liquidity position and stress test  assuming various what if scenarios. The ALCO is responsible for ensuring adherence to the limits set by the Board as well  as for deciding the business strategy of the Company in line with the Company’s budget and decided risk management  objectives. It is a decision-making unit responsible for balance sheet planning from risk-return perspective including  strategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks. It also evaluates the borrowing plan of subsequent quarters on  the basis of previous borrowings of the Company. It will be responsible for ensuring the adherence to the target set by  the Board of Directors. The meetings of ALCO are held at quarterly intervals. The ALM support groups, consisting of  operating staff are responsible for analysing, monitoring and reporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The ALCO support  group meets every fortnight. The minutes of ALCO meetings are placed before the RMC and the Board of Directors in its  next meeting for its ratification.  56 RISK MANAGEMENT  ( Contd .)

56 RISK MANAGEMENT  (Contd.) 56.04:  Market risk Market risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables  such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Company classifies exposures to market risk into either  trading or non-trading portfolios and manages each of those portfolios separately. 56.04.01: Interest rate risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates to the Company’s outstanding floating rate liabilities. Most of  the Company’s outstanding liability is on fixed rate basis and hence not subject to interest rate risk. Some of the borrowings  of the Company are linked to rate benchmarks such as Bank Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) or  Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), RBI Repo Rate, Treasury Bill Linked Lending Rate (TBLR) and Mumbai Inter- Bank Overnight Indexed Swap (MIOIS) and hence subject to interest rate risk. The Company hedges interest rate risks of  foreign currency borrowings through derivative transactions. The sensitivity of the Company’s floating rate borrowings to  change in interest rate (assuming all other variables constant) is given below: (Rs. in crores) Particulars As at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024 Carrying  amount  Favourable  change 1%  increase  Unfavourable  change 1%  decrease  Carrying  amount   Favourable  change 1%  increase  Unfavourable  change 1%  decrease Debt instrument  650.00   69.01   (87.61)  883.39   85.20   (105.58) Term loans  20,502.47   1,990.99   (2,474.15)  21,998.75   1,834.42   (2,284.12) Total floating rate  borrowings  21,152.47   2,060.00   (2,561.76)  22,882.14   1,919.62   (2,389.70)     Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments     The Company’s fixed rate instruments are carried at amortised cost and are not measured for interest rate risk, as neither  the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.    Inter-Bank Offered Rate (IBOR) reform               The U.S. Dollar LIBOR bank panel ended on June 30, 2023, and therefore the exposure with the Company was transitioned  from LIBOR to SOFR. There was no exposure to IBOR risk as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024.      56.04.02: Foreign currency risk                Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange  rates. The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk for its foreign currency borrowing. The Company’s  borrowings in foreign currency are governed by RBI Master Direction External Commercial Borrowings, Trade Credits and  Structured Obligations dated March 26, 2019 (as and when updated) which requires entities raising External Commercial  Borrowings (ECB) for an average maturity of less than 5 years to hedge minimum 70% of the its ECB exposure. The  Company hedges its entire ECB and external commercial bond exposure as per Board approved hedging policy and  resource mobilisation policy. The Company manages  foreign currency risk by entering in to cross currency swaps and  forward contract. When a derivative is entered in to for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of  those derivatives to match with the terms of the hedge exposure. The Company holds derivative financial instruments such  as cross currency interest rate swap to mitigate risk of changes in exchange rate in foreign currency and floating interest  rate. The Counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in market  place. Refer note 22 and 23 for terms and conditions of foreign currency borrowings.

Hedge effectiveness is  determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to  ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Company enters into  hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item,  and so a qualitative assessment of effectiveness is performed. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged  item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Company  uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. Ineffectiveness is recognised on a cash flow hedge where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the  hedging instrument exceeds on an absolute basis the change in value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. In  such  cases,  ineffectiveness  may  arise  if:            (a)      The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item differ (i.e. nominal amounts, timing of the  forecast transaction, interest resets changes from what was originally estimated), or   (b)      Differences arise between the credit risk inherent within the hedged item and the hedging instrument.   There were no ineffectiveness recognised in the statement of profit and loss. There were no other sources of ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships. 56 RISK MANAGEMENT  ( Contd .)

Disclosure pursuant to SEBI circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS-RACPOD1/P/CIR/2023/172 dated October 19, 2023 on  framework for fund raising by issuance of fund raising by large corporates (LCs) 82 SHORTFALL IN FUND RAISING BY ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES   As part of the Company’s strategic approach to maintain funding diversity, it utilizes a broad range of financing sources  including loans from banks and financial institutions, domestic capital markets, public deposits, offshore borrowings and  securitisation. During the financial year ended March 31, 2025, the Company executed several significant transactions  through offshore borrowings and securitisation, enhancing funding diversity and fostering new lender relationships.  However, the domestic debt capital market continues to remain shallow for non-AAA rated entities, limiting capital raising  opportunities. Further, volatility in interest rates made it challenging to consistently execute capital market transactions  throughout  the  year.        Despite raising significant funds from the domestic capital market during the financial year ended March 31, 2025, there  was a shortfall in meeting the prescribed requirement under the framework for fund raising by issuance of debt securities  by large borrowers. The Company has subsequently bridged this shortfall in April 2025, thereby ensuring compliance  within the stipulated timelines.

All non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of Rs. 10,000 crores  and above, and all deposit taking NBFCs irrespective of their asset size, is required to maintain a liquidity buffer in terms of LCR which will promote resilience of NBFCs to  potential liquidity disruptions by ensuring that they have sufficient High Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) to survive any acute liquidity stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The  stock of HQLA to be maintained by the NBFCs shall be minimum of 100% of total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days. The objective of the LCR is to promote  the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile. Presently, the Company is mandated to maintain a minimum LCR of 85%, effective December 01, 2023, progressively  reaching up to the required level of 100% by December 01, 2024.   The LCR requirement was applicable from December 01, 2020 with the minimum HQLAs to be held being 50% of the LCR, progressively reaching a level upto 60%, 70%,  85% and 100% by December 01, 2021, December 01, 2022, December 01, 2023, December 01, 2024 respectively. The Company has implemented the LCR framework and  has maintained LCR well above the regulatory threshold for all the quarters.      The LCR is calculated by dividing the Company’s stock of HQLA by its total net outflows over a 30 days stress period.     “High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)” means liquid assets that can be readily sold or immediately converted into cash at little or no loss of value or used as collateral to  obtain funds in a range of stress scenarios. Total net cash outflows is defined as the total expected cash outflows minus total expected cash inflows for the subsequent 30  calendar days. The main drivers of LCR are adequate HQLAs and lower net cash outflow.       Major source of borrowing for the Company are non-convertible debentures – institutional, term loan/cash credit from banks, term loans from financial institutions/  corporates, commercial papers, deposits, inter corporate deposits, external commercial borrowings (loans), U.S. Dollar senior secured notes, subordinated debts. Details  of funding concentration from Significant Counterparties are given in note 87.     The average LCR is computed as simple averages of daily observations over the previous quarter.     The average LCR for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 is 286.73 % which is well above against RBI prescribed LCR of 100%.

To the Members of Shriram Finance Limited REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Opinion 1.   We have audited the accompanying Consolidated  Financial Statements of Shriram Finance Limited (the  “Holding Company”), its subsidiary (the Holding  Company and its subsidiary together referred to as  the “Group”) and its associate for the year ended  March 31, 2025 (“the Statement”), which comprise the  Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including  Other Comprehensive Income/Loss), the Consolidated  Cash Flow Statement and the Consolidated Statement  of Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date,  and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  including a summary of material accounting policies  and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred  to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).  2.   In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, and based  on the consideration of reports of other auditor on  special purpose financial statements of the subsidiary,  and the unaudited financial information of an associate  as furnished to us by the Management of the Holding  Company referred to in the Other Matters section  below, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements  give the information required by the Companies Act,  2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give  a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian  Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) prescribed under  section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, the  relevant circulars, guidelines and directions issued  by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time  (“RBI Guidelines”) and other accounting principles  generally accepted in India of the consolidated state  of affairs of the Group and its associate as at March 31,  2025, and their consolidated profit (including other  comprehensive income/loss), consolidated cash flows  and the consolidated changes in equity for the year  ended on that date. Basis for Opinion 3.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards  on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of  the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards  are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities  for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  section of our report. We are independent of the Group  and its associate in accordance with the Code of Ethics  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that  are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules  made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements  and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit  evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of  audit report of the other auditor referred to in the ‘Other  Matter’ paragraph below is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion on the Consolidated  Financial Statements. Key Audit Matter 4.   Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in  our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. These  matters were addressed in the context of our audit of  the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and  in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide  a separate opinion on these matters. 5.   We have determined the matter described below to be  the key audit matters to be communicated in our report  on Standalone Financial Statements of the Holding  Company. INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT   378 Annual Report 2024-25 

INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT     (Contd.) Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Impairment Loss Allowance of loans and advances (Reference to Note 13 & 40 read with Material  Accounting Policies 7.1 (VI), forming part of  Consolidated Financial Statements - Schedule to the  Consolidated Financial Statements)  (in INR Crores) Gross Advances 2,59,915.91 Provisions 14,523.12 Net Advances 2,45,392.79 Significant estimates and judgments involved in  Key Audit Matter Reserve Bank of India has issued Master circular  and other clarifications on Income Recognition and  Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to  Advances (“IRAC”). These guidelines prescribe the  prudential norms for identification and classification  of advances as Stage 3/ NPAs. The Company has applied significant judgement to  determine the identification and classification of  such assets as Stage 3/ NPAs by applying quantitative  as well as qualitative factors. The risk of identification  of such assets as Stage 3/ NPAs is affected by factors  like stress and liquidity concerns of such assets. Impairment loss allowance of loans and advances  (“Impairment loss allowance”) is a Key Audit  Matter as the Company has significant credit risk  exposure considering the large loan portfolio across  a wide geographical range. The value of loans and  advances on the balance sheet is significant and  there is a high degree of complexity and judgment  involved in estimating individual and collective  credit impairment provisions, write-offs against  these loans and to additionally determine the  asset quality and provision of the Company. The  Company’s model to calculate Expected Credit  Loss (“ECL”) is inherently complex and judgment is  applied in determining the correct construction of  the three-stage impairment model (“ECL Model”)  including the selection and input of forward-looking  information. ECL provision calculation require  the use of large volumes of data. The completeness  and reliability of data can significantly impact  accuracy of the modelled impairment provisions.  The accuracy of data flows and the implementation  of related controls are critical for the integrity of the  estimated impairment provisions. Audit Procedures included but were not limited to the following: We started our audit procedures with understanding of the internal control environment  related to Impairment loss allowance. Our procedures over internal controls focused on  recognition and measurement of impairment loss allowance. We assessed the design  and tested the operating effectiveness of the selected key controls implemented by the  Company. We also assessed whether the impairment methodology used by the Company is in  accordance with the assumptions and methodology approved by the Board of Directors  of the Company which is based on and in compliance with Ind AS 109 “Financial  Instruments”. Accordingly, we assessed the approach of the Company regarding definition of Default,  Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and incorporation of forward-  looking information for the calculation of ECL. For loans and advances which are assessed  for impairment on a portfolio basis, we performed particularly the following procedures:   •   We read the Company’s policies for identification, classification and assessing  compliance for Stage 3/ NPAs customers in line with the IRAC norms; •   We understood the design, reliability and operating effectiveness of key data inputs  and related management controls; •   We performed substantial audit procedure relating to identification and classification  of Stage 3/ NPAs by the company. •   We tested the identification/ grouping of the loan accounts mapped with the  customer code as identified by the management; •   We performed analytical procedures to identify possible cases of evergreening of  loans and tested these on sample basis. •   We checked the stage classification as at the balance sheet date as per the definition  of Default of the Company and Reserve Bank of India circulars issued from time to  time; •   We validated the ECL Model and its calculation by involving our Information  Technology Expert; •   We have checked on sample basis that the stage classification for the borrowers has  been given in accordance with the Resolution Framework issued by Reserve Bank  of India (the “RBI”) and the Board approved policy for ECL provisioning and stage  classification with respect to such accounts; •   We have verified whether the ECL provision is made in accordance with the Board  Approved Policy in this regard; •   We have also calculated the ECL provision manually for selected samples; •   We have assessed the assumptions made by the Company in making accelerated  provision considering forward looking information. For loans and advances which are written off during the year under audit, we read and  understood the methodology and policy laid down and implemented by the Company in  this regard along with its compliance on sample basis. Information other than the Consolidated Financial  Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon 6.   The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is  responsible for the preparation of other information. The  other information comprises the information included  in the Holding Company’s Board’s Report, (including  annexures thereto) and Management Discussion and  Analysis (“MD&A”) (collectively referred to as “Other  Information”), but does not include the Consolidated  Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.    Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.   In connection with our audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the  Other Information and, in doing so, consider whether  the Other Information is materially inconsistent  with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our  knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based  CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 379 Shriram Finance Limited 

on the work we have performed, we conclude that there  is a material misstatement of this other information,  we are required to report that fact. we have nothing to  report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and those charged with  governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements 7.   The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements  have been approved by the Holding Company’s Board of  Directors. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors  are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of  the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation  of these Consolidated Financial Statements that give a  true and fair view of the consolidated financial position,  consolidated financial performance (including other  comprehensive income/loss), consolidated changes  in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in  accordance with the Ind AS specified under section  133 of the Act, RBI Guidelines and other accounting  principles generally accepted in India. 8.   The respective Board of Directors of the Group and  its associate are also responsible for maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the  provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of  the Group and its associate and for preventing and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls, that were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose  of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements  by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as  aforesaid. 9.   In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the  respective Management and the Board of Directors of  the Group and its associate are responsible for assessing  the ability of the Group and its associate to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related  to going concern and using the going concern basis  of accounting unless the Management and the Board  of Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to  cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do  so. 10.   Those respective Board of Directors are also responsible  for overseeing the financial reporting process of Group  and its associate. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements 11.   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a  whole are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a  high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an  audit conducted in accordance with Standards on  Auditing will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or  error and are considered material if, individually or  in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 12.   As part of an audit in accordance with Standards  on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the  Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: •   Identify and assess the risks of material  misstatement of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and perform audit procedures responsive to those  risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the  override of internal control; •   Obtain an understanding of internal financial  control relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act  we are also responsible for expressing our opinion  on the internal financial controls system with  reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements  and the operating effectiveness of such controls  based on our audit; •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates and related disclosures made by the  Board of Directors; •   Conclude on the appropriateness of the  management’s use of the going concern basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the ability of the Group and  its associate to continue as a going concern. If we  conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are  INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT     (Contd.) 380 Annual Report 2024-25 

required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to  the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial  Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group and its associate  to cease to continue as a going concern; •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  Consolidated Financial Statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation; and •   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence  regarding the unaudited financial information  of such entities or business activities within the  Group and its associate, to express an opinion  on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We  are responsible for the direction, supervision and  performance of the audit of financial statements of  such entities included in the Consolidated Financial  Statements, of which we are the independent  auditors. For the other entities included in the  Consolidated Financial Statements, which have  been audited by other auditor, such other auditor  remains responsible for the direction, supervision  and performance of the audit carried out by them.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 13.   We communicate with those charged with governance  of the Holding Company, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit. 14.   We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 15.   From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements of the current period and are  therefore the key audit matters. We describe these  matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation  precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that  a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication. Other Matters 16.   We did not audit the special purpose interim financial  statements of Shriram Housing Finance Limited  (SHFL), which ceased to be a subsidiary w.e.f.  December 11, 2024 on sale of entire investments which  were sold by the Holding Company on December 11,  2024, whose financial statements reflect total revenues  (before consolidation adjustments) of ₹ 1,285.90 crores,  total net profit (before consolidation adjustments) of  ₹ 140.70 crores and the other comprehensive loss of  ₹ 7.09 crores, net cash outflow (before consolidation  adjustments) of ₹ 137.64 crores, for the period from  April 1, 2024 to December 11, 2024, as considered in  the Consolidated Financial Statements. These special  purpose interim financial statements have been audited  by other auditor whose report has been furnished  to us by the Management and our opinion on the  Consolidated Financial Statements, in so far as it relates  to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of  this subsidiary and our report in terms of section 143(3)  of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiary  is based solely on the reports of the other auditor. 17.   The Consolidated Financial Statements also include  the Group’s share of net profit of ₹12.31 crores and  other comprehensive loss of ₹ 1.15 crores for the year  ended March 31, 2025 respectively, in respect of an  associate, whose financial information have not been  audited by their auditors. Those financial information  are unaudited and have been furnished to us by the  Management of the Holding Company and our opinion  on the Consolidated Financial Statements, in so far  as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included  in respect of this associate, and our report in terms of  section 143(3) of the Act in so far as it relates to the  aforesaid associate, is based solely on such unaudited  financial information. According to the information  and explanations given to us by the Management, this  unaudited financial information is not material to the  Group. 18.   Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements,  and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory  Requirements below, is not modified in respect of  the above matters with respect to our reliance on the  (a) work done and the report of the other auditor in  the case of the subsidiary and (b) unaudited financial  information furnished to us by the Management of the  Holding Company in the case of the associate. 19.   The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company  for the year ended March 31, 2024 were audited by  the predecessor joint auditors, who have expressed an  unmodified opinion on those Consolidated Financial  Statements vide their audit report dated April 26,  INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT     (Contd.)

ANNEXURE I   TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT Annexure I to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even  date to the members of Shriram Finance Limited on the  Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year  ended March 31, 2025 Independent Auditor’s Report on the internal financial  controls with reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section  143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) (Referred to in paragraph 21(f) under ‘Reports on Other  Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of  even date) 1.     In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements of Shriram Finance Limited (the  “Holding Company”), its subsidiary (the Holding  Company and its subsidiary together referred to as the  “Group”) and its associate as at and for the year ended  March 31, 2025, we have audited the internal financial  controls with reference to the Financial Statements of  the Holding Company, as at that date. Management’s Responsibilities for Internal Financial  Controls 2.   The Holding Company’s management is responsible  for establishing and maintaining internal financial  controls based on the internal controls over financial  reporting criteria established by the Holding Company  considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the  “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls that were  operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to the Holding Company’s policies, the safeguarding  of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and  errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal  Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements 3.   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on  the internal financial controls, with reference to  Consolidated Financial Statements, based on our  audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note and Standards on Auditing issued by the  ICAI prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the  extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls  with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to  Consolidated Financial Statements were established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects. 4.   Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls with reference to these Consolidated  Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness.  Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to  Consolidated Financial Statements includes obtaining  an understanding of such internal financial controls with  reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error. 5.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion on the internal financial controls with  reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial Statements  6.   A Company’s internal financial controls with reference  to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes  in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A Company’s internal financial controls  with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements  include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated  Financial Statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  expenditures of the Company are being made only in  accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  Company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the Consolidated Financial Statements. 384 Annual Report 2024-25 

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements  7.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls with reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated  Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial controls with reference  to Consolidated Financial Statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the  degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion 8.   In our opinion to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us the Holding  Company, has maintained in all material respects, an  adequate internal financial controls with reference  to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such  controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025,  based on the internal financial controls with reference to  Consolidated Financial Statements criteria, established  by the Holding Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note.

5 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Ind AS as per the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time, notified under Section 133 of the Companies  Act, 2013 and the other relevant provisions of the Act.  The group has consistently applied accounting policies to all the periods.  6 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS The MCA has announced amendments to the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 through its various  notifications issued during the financial year 2024-25.  The notification dated August 12, 2024 has notified the new accounting standard, Ind AS 117 - Insurance Contracts,  applicable from April 01, 2024.  Subsequently, through its notification dated September 28, 2024, MCA allowed insurers to use Ind AS 104 - Insurance  Contracts for preparing consolidated financial statements until Ind AS 117 is notified by the IRDA and inserted a Schedule  on Ind AS 104 which outlines the financial reporting requirements for insurance contracts. This notification was made  applicable with immediate effect. MCA also amended Ind AS 116 - Leases, by inserting new provisions relating to sale and leaseback transactions, through  its notification dated September 09, 2024, applicable with immediate effect. The Group has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has determined that it does not have any  significant impact on its financial statements. 7 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The material accounting policies related to preparation of the consolidated financial statements are given below: 7.1      Financial instruments    Initial recognition (I)    Classification of financial instruments     The classification depends on the contractual terms of the cashflows of the financial assets and the Group’s business  model for managing financial assets which are explained below:    a)   Business model assessment          The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial  assets to achieve its business objective. The Group’s business model is not assessed on an instrument by  instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:            How the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model  are evaluated and reported to the respective company’s  key management personnel.            The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that  business model) and the way those risks are managed.             How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on  the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).            The expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment.  The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking ‘worst case’  or ‘stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that  is different from the Group’s original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of  the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when  assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 396 Annual Report 2024-25 

           At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Group determines whether newly recognised financial  assets are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect the commencement of a new  business model. The Group reassesses its business models each reporting period to determine whether  the business models have changed since the preceding period.         For the current and prior reporting periods, the Group has not identified a change in its business model.    b)   The Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) test           As a second step of its classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to  identify whether they meet the SPPI test.          Principal for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and  may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation  of the premium/ discount).          In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a  basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk,  other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where  the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending  arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss  (FVTPL).        The Group classifies its financial instruments into the following measurement categories: (1)   Financial assets measured at amortised cost     These financial assets comprise bank balances, loans, trade receivables, other receivables, investments and other  financial assets.    Debt instruments     Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost where they have:       i)     contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specified dates, that represent solely payments of principal  and interest on the principal amount outstanding; and       ii)     are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by holding to collect contractual cash flows.     These debt instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and  subsequently measured at amortised cost. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing  component are initially measured at transaction price. (2)    Financial assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)    Debt instruments     Investments in debt instruments are measured at FVTOCI where they have:       i)     contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specified dates, that represent solely payments of principal  and interest on the principal amount outstanding; and       ii)     are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and  selling financial assets.     These debt instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and  subsequently measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in Other  Comprehensive Income (OCI) within a separate component of equity. Impairment losses or reversals, interest  revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Upon disposal, the  cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the statement of profit and loss.  As at the reporting date, the Group does not have any debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 397 Shriram Finance Limited 

   Equity instruments     Investment in equity instruments that are neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by the  Group in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 ‘Business Combination’ applies, are measured FVTOCI,  where an irrevocable election has been made by management and when such instruments meet the definition of  Equity under Ind AS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation. Such classification is determined on an instrument- by-instrument basis. Amounts presented in OCI are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profit and  loss. Dividends on such investments are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.   (3)    Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL     Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, with transaction  costs recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value and  any gains or losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as they arise.     Items measured at FVTPL comprise of:     i)     Investments (including equity shares) held for trading:        Financial instruments held for trading          A financial instrument is classified as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred principally for selling or  repurchasing in the near term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together  and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking, or it is a derivative not in a qualifying hedge  relationship.        Trading securities are classified as held for trading and recognised at FVTPL.         Equity Investments          Investment in Associate is carried at cost in the Separate Financial Statements as permitted under Ind AS  27. The Company had accounted for its investment in subsidiary consequent to business combination at fair  value at the time of acquisition. The investment was subsequently measured at cost. It was fully sold during  the current financial year. All other equity investments except those measured at FVTOCI are measured at  FVTPL.     ii)    Items specifically designated as FVTPL on initial recognition        Financial liability designated at FVTPL          A financial liability may be designated at FVTPL if it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting  mismatch or:        •   if a host contract contains one or more embedded derivatives; or        •     if financial assets and liabilities are both managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value  basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.     iii)    Debt instruments with contractual terms that do not represent solely payments of principal and interest.  4)     Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL     The Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through  the profit and loss or is required to measure liabilities at FVTPL such as derivative liabilities.     Where a financial liability is designated at FVTPL, the movement in fair value attributable to changes in the Group’s  own credit quality is calculated by determining the changes in credit spreads above observable market interest rates  and is presented separately in OCI. As at the reporting date, the Group has not designated any financial liability as  measured at FVTPL.

(II)    Derivatives      A derivative is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:        Its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity  price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided  that, in the case of a non-financial variable, it is not specific to a party to the contract (i.e., the ‘underlying’).        It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for  other types of contracts expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.      It is settled at a future date.     The Group enters into derivative transactions with various counterparties to hedge its foreign currency risks and  interest rate risks. Derivative transaction consists of hedging of foreign exchange transactions, which includes  interest rate and currency swaps, interest rate options and forwards. The Group undertakes derivative transactions  for hedging on-balance sheet liabilities.       Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when  their fair value is negative. The notional amount and fair value of such derivatives are disclosed separately. Changes  in the fair value of derivatives are included in net gain on fair value changes.    Hedge accounting     The Group has adopted hedge accounting. The Group makes use of derivative instruments to manage exposures to  interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. In order to manage particular risks, the Group applies hedge accounting  for transactions that meet specified criteria. The Group has formally designated and documented the hedge  relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy  for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes the Group’s risk management objective and strategy for  undertaking hedge, the hedging/ economic relationship, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being  hedged, hedge ratio and how the Group would assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair  value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such  hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are assessed on an on- going basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for  which they were designated.      Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted as follows:     Cash flow hedge     A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  associated with a recognised asset or liability and could affect the statement of profit and loss. For designated  and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is  initially recognised directly in other comprehensive income as cash flow hedge reserve. The ineffective portion of  the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately as finance cost in the statement of profit and  loss. When the hedged cash flow affects the statement of profit and loss, the effective portion of the gain or loss on  the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or expense line of the statement of profit and loss.  When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria  for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss that has been recognised in OCI at that time remains in OCI  and is recognised when the hedged forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of profit and loss.  When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in OCI is  immediately transferred to the statement of profit and loss.

(III)    Debt securities and other borrowed funds     After initial measurement, debt issued and other borrowed funds are subsequently measured at amortised cost.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on issue funds, and transaction costs  that are an integral part of the Effective Interest Rate (EIR).  (IV)    Reclassification of financial assets and liabilities     The Group does not reclassify its financial assets subsequent to their initial recognition. Financial liabilities are  never reclassified. The Group did not reclassify any of its financial assets or liabilities during the year ended March  31, 2025, though there may be regrouping of the financial assets or liabilities. (V)    Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities    a)   Recognition        (1)     Loans and advances are initially recognised when the funds are transferred to the customer’s account  or delivery of assets by the dealer, whichever is earlier.         (2)   Investments are initially recognised on the settlement date.        (3)   Debt securities, deposits and borrowings are initially recognised when funds reach the Group.          Other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way trades: purchases  or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by  regulation or convention in the market place.     b)   Derecognition of financial assets due to substantial modification of terms and conditions          The Group derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have  been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as  derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly  recognised loans are classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless the new loan is deemed to be  Purchased or Originated as Credit Impaired (POCI).          If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not  result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group records  a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.    c)   Derecognition of financial assets other than due to substantial modification        (1)    Financial assets            A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial  assets) is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. The  Group also derecognises the financial asset if it has both transferred the financial asset and the transfer  qualifies for derecognition.          The Group has transferred the financial asset if, and only if, either:                   i.           The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset,  or                   ii.        It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash  flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement.            Pass-through arrangements are transactions whereby the Group retains the contractual rights to  receive the cash flows of a financial asset (the ‘original asset’), but assumes a contractual obligation to  pay those cash flows to one or more entities (the ‘eventual recipients’), when all of the following three  conditions are met:                   i.        The Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected  equivalent amounts from the original asset, excluding short-term advances with the right to  full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 400 Annual Report 2024-25 

                  ii.        The Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual  recipients.                 iii.          The Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without  material delay. In addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows, except for  investments in cash or cash equivalents including interest earned, during the period between  the collection date and the date of required remittance to the eventual recipients.          A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either:                  i.         The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or                 ii.        The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the  asset, but has transferred control of the asset.            The Group considers control to be transferred if and only if, the transferee has the practical ability to  sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally  and without imposing additional restrictions on the transfer.            When the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and has  retained control of the asset, the asset continues to be recognised only to the extent of the Group’s  continuing involvement, in which case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred  asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that  the Group has retained. Interest income on such assets is recognised as per policy as explained in note  7.2(I).            On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount  (measured at the date of derecognition) and the consideration received (including any new asset  obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Accordingly,  gain or loss on sale or derecognition of assigned portfolio are recorded upfront in the statement of  profit and loss as per Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments. Also, the Group recognises servicing income  as a percentage of interest spread over tenure of loan in cases where it retains the obligation to service  the transferred financial asset. As per the guidelines of RBI, the Group is required to retain certain  portion of the loan assigned to parties in its books as Minimum Retention Requirement (‘MRR’).  Therefore, it continues to recognise the portion retained by it as MRR.        (2)    Financial liabilities             A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled  or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on  substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an  exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition  of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the  consideration paid is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. As at the reporting date, the Group  does not have any financial liabilities which have been derecognised. (VI)    Impairment of financial assets    a.   Overview of the ECL principles          The Group records allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other financial assets not held  at (FVTPL), in this section all referred to as ‘financial instruments’. Equity instruments are not subject to  impairment under Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments.          The ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime  expected credit loss), unless there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which  case, the allowance is based on the 12-months expected credit loss.          Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of  a financial instrument. The 12-months ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represent the ECLs that result  from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 401 Shriram Finance Limited 

         Both Lifetime ECLs and 12-months ECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis,  depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments. The Company has grouped its  loan portfolio into commercial vehicles, construction equipments, farm equipment, passenger vehicles, gold  loan, personal loans, MSME, secured, MSME unsecured, two wheeler, loans to NBFC.           The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether  a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the  change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group does  the assessment of significant increase in credit risk at a borrower level. If a borrower has various facilities  having different past due status, then the highest Days Past Due (DPD) is considered to be applicable for all  the facilities of that borrower.        Based on the above, the Group categorises its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:        Stage 1          All exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that has  low credit risk at the reporting date and that are not credit impaired upon origination are classified under this  stage. The Group classifies all standard advances and advances upto 30 days default under this category. Stage  1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage  2 or Stage 3.        Stage 2          All exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are not  credit impaired are classified under this stage. 30 Days Past Due is considered as significant increase in credit  risk.         Stage 3          All exposures assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the  estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred are classified in this stage. For exposures that have  becomes credit impaired, a lifetime ECL is recognised and interest revenue is calculated by applying the  effective interest rate (EIR) to the amortised cost (net of provision) rather than the gross carrying amount.  90 Days Past Due is considered as default for classifying a financial instrument as credit impaired. If an event  (for example any natural calamity) warrants a provision higher than as mandated under ECL methodology,  the Group may classify the financial asset in Stage 3 accordingly.           As required by Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Company-Scale based  regulation) Directions, 2023 RBI/DoR/2023-24/106 DoR.FIN.REC.No.45/03.10.119/2023-24 dated October  19, 2023 where impairment allowance under Ind AS 109 is lower than the provisioning required as per extant  prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) including borrower/ beneficiary wise classification, provisioning for standard as well as restructured assets, NPA ageing, etc., the  Company shall appropriate the difference from their net profit or loss after tax to a separate impairment  reserve.          Borrower accounts shall be flagged as overdue as part of the day-end processes for the due date, irrespective of  the time of running such processes. Similarly, classification of borrower accounts as Non-Performing Asset/  Stage 3 shall be done as part of day-end process for the relevant date i.e. 90 Days Past Due and (NPA)/ Stage 3  classification date shall be the calendar date for which the day end process is run. In other words, the date of  NPA/ Stage 3 shall reflect the asset classification status of an account at the day-end of that calendar date.           Upgradation of accounts classified as Stage 3/ Non-performing assets (NPA) - The Group upgrades loan  accounts classified as Stage 3/ NPA to ‘standard’ asset category only if the entire arrears of interest, principal  and other amount are paid by the borrower and there is no change in the accounting policy followed by the  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 402 Annual Report 2024-25 

Group in this regard. With regard to upgradation of accounts classified as NPA due to restructuring, the  instructions as specified for such cases as per the said RBI guidelines shall continue to be applicable.        (1)   Credit- impaired financial assets             At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt  financial assets carried at FVTOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one  or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset  have occurred.          Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:          a)     Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;          b)     A breach of contract such as a default or past due event;          c)        The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider  otherwise;          d)        It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;          e)     repossession of security or          f)     The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.        (2)   ECL on investment in Government Securities            The Group has invested in Government of India loans. Investment in Government securities are  classified under stage 1. No ECL has been applied on these investments as there is no history of delay  in servicing of interest/ repayments. The Group does not expect any delay in interest/ redemption  servicing in future.        (3)   ECL on Pass Through Certificates (PTC)            The Group recognises the ECL on PTC on a collective basis by taking into account comprehensive  credit risk information and is computed in similar manner as loans measured at amortised cost.        (4)   ECL on loans secured by the Company’s fixed deposit            No ECL has been applied on loans given against the Company’s fixed deposit as they are fully secured  by the Company’s fixed deposits.         (5)   ECL on Fixed Deposits with Banks            No ECL is applied on fixed deposits held with banks as there is no history of default. However, in case  of any downgrade in the credit rating of the banks where fixed deposit is held, the Company would  provide for ECL computed in an appropriate methodology. From March 2025, ECL on fixed deposits  with banks is determined using rates from established sources.        (6)   Simplified approach for trade/ other receivables and contract assets              The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade/  other receivables that do not contain a significant financing component. The application of simplified  approach does not require the Group to track changes in credit risk. It recognises impairment loss  allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. At every  reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated for changes in the forward-looking  estimates. For trade receivables that contain a significant financing component a general approach is  followed.        (7)   ECL on debt instruments measured at  FVTOCI            The ECLs for debt instruments measured at FVTOCI do not reduce the carrying amount of these  financial assets in the balance sheet, which remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 403 Shriram Finance Limited 

allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortised cost is recognised in OCI as an  accumulated impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to the statement of profit and loss. The  accumulated loss recognised in OCI is recycled to the statement of profit and loss upon derecognition  of the assets. As at the reporting date, Group does not have any debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.        (8)   ECL on Undrawn loan commitments             When estimating ECL for undrawn loan commitments, a credit conversion factor of 100% is applied  for expected drawdown. The Group discloses ECL allowance on undrawn loan commitments under  the head ‘Provisions’ under non-financial liabilities.    (b)    The mechanics of ECL          The Group calculates ECLs based on probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls,  discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are  due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.        The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:        (1)   Probability of Default (PD)             The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default  may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously  derecognised and is still in the portfolio. The concept of PD is further explained in note 58.02.02.02.        (2)   Exposure at Default (EAD)             The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date. The concept of EAD is  further explained in note 58.02.02.03.        (3)   Loss Given Default (LGD)              The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given  time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Group  would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a  percentage of the EAD. The concept of LGD is explained in note 58.02.02.04.        (4)   Forward looking information            While estimating the expected credit losses, the Company identifies the key macro-economic factors  (independent variables) basis the R-square and the economic relationship between the independent  variable and the default rates and the most relevant macro-economic factor affecting the particular  loan product is factored in while arriving at the PD of that product.             On a periodic basis, the Company monitors the situation and economic factors affecting the operations  of the Company and assesses the requirement of any modification to ECL model.        (5)   Stress testing            The Company formulated three different macro-economic stress scenarios under the premise of mild  stress, medium stress and severe stress condition. The medium stress scenario largely reflected the  current economic conditions, and accordingly was used for ECL purpose.         (6)   Collateral repossessed             In its normal course of business whenever default occurs, the Group may take possession of properties  or other assets in its retail portfolio and generally disposes such assets through auction, to settle  outstanding debt. Any surplus funds are returned to the customers/ obligors. The Group generally  does not use the assets repossessed for the internal operations. The underlying loans in respect of  which collaterals have been repossessed and not sold for more than 6 months are considered as Stage 3  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 404 Annual Report 2024-25 

assets and fully provided for net of estimated realisable value or written off. As a result of this practice,  assets under legal repossession processes are not recorded on the balance sheet as it does not meet  the recognition criteria in other standards and consequently the Group also does not derecognise  the underlying financial asset immediately on repossession. Repossessed house property of SHFL  comprised of house and land properties, which were held as collaterals against the loans given to  customer, whose physical and legal possessing has been taken over by that company due to customers’  default on repayment of the loan. Management normally intended to sell these properties for which  regular auctions were conducted. Asset was to be to be sold within three years from possession date  and if the investment in such properties (land and buildings) exceeded 20% of capital fund as per  NBFC - Housing Finance Company (Reserve Bank) directions, 2021 (of which such investment over  and above 10% of owned fund shall be in residential units), the excess supposed to be written off.        (7)   Restructured loans            The Group is permitted to restructure customer accounts. Restructuring would normally involve  modification of terms of the advances/ securities, which would generally include, among others,  alteration of payment period/ payable amount/ the amount of installments/ rate of interest/ sanction  of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for a customer account. The Group considers  the modification of the loan only before the loans gets credit impaired. In case of restructuring, the  accounts classified as ‘standard’ shall be immediately downgraded as non-performing assets/ Stage  3 unless and other wise explicitly stated in the Circulars and Directions issued by Reserve Bank of  India from time to time. Once an asset has been classified as restructured, it will remain restructured  for a period of one year from the date on which it has been restructured until the customer account  demonstrates satisfactory performance during the specified period.            For upgradation of accounts classified as NPA due to restructuring, the instructions as specified for  such cases as per the said RBI guidelines shall continue to be applicable.            Loan accounts which have been restructured or modified in accordance with RBI Notifications -  RBI/2020-21/16 DOR. No.BP.BC/3/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 06, 2020- Resolution Framework  for COVID-19 related Stress and RBI/2021-22/31/DOR.STR.REC.11/21.04.048/2021-22 dated May  05, 2021- Resolution Framework – 2.0: Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Individuals and Small  Businesses and RBI/2020-21/17 DOR. No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020-21- dated August 06, 2020 - Micro,  Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector – Restructuring of Advances and  RBI/2021-22/32  DOR.STR.REC.12/21.04.048/2021-22 dated May 05, 2021 Resolution Framework 2.0 – Resolution  of Covid-19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have been classified as  Stage 2 due to significant increase in credit risk. VII)     Write-offs       The Group reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when the Group has no reasonable expectations of  recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Group determines  that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to repay  the amounts subjected to write-offs. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are accounted under bad debt  recovery disclosed under other operating income. Write off in case of standard accounts is done by way of waiver of  last one or two instalments in case the borrower pays all the EMIs as per the due dates mentioned in the agreement. (VIII)    Determination of fair value         On initial recognition, all the financial instruments are measured at fair value. For subsequent measurement, the  Group measures certain categories of financial instruments [as explained in note 7.1(I) (1) to 7.1(I) (3)] at fair value  on each balance sheet date.     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption  that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 405 Shriram Finance Limited 

      i.        In the principal market for the asset or liability, or       ii.     In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.     The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.     The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when  pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.     A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate  economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that  would use the asset in its highest and best use.     The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data  are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of  unobservable inputs.     In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of  valuation techniques, as summarised below:    Level 1 -  Those financial instruments where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from  active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has access to at the measurement date. The Group  considers markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of  the identical assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance  sheet date.    Level 2 -  Those financial instruments where the inputs that are used for valuation are significant, and derived from  directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instrument’s life. Such inputs  include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in  inactive markets and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied  volatilities, and credit spreads. In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset  or the extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to the valued instrument. However, if such adjustments  are based on unobservable inputs which are significant to the entire measurement, the Group will classify the  instruments as Level 3.    Level 3 -  Those financial instruments that include one or more unobservable input that is signiﬁcant to the  measurement as whole.     The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during  which the change has occurred. No such instances of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy were  recorded during the reporting period.      Difference between transaction price and fair value at initial recognition     The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair  value of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with  other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or  based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. When such evidence  exists, the Group recognises the difference between the transaction price and the fair value in profit or loss on initial  recognition (i.e. on day one).     When the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based  on a valuation technique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Group recognises the difference  between the transaction price and fair value in net gain on fair value changes. In those cases where fair value is  based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price  and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the inputs become  observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

7.2      Revenue from operations (I)    Interest Income       Interest income is recognised by applying the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial  assets measured at amortised cost other than credit-impaired assets and financial assets classified as measured at  FVTPL.     The EIR in case of a financial asset is computed:              a.        As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial  asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset.              b.     By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.             c.        Including all fees received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the EIR, transaction  costs, and all other premiums or discounts.       Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the  corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets.     Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the EIR to the net amortised cost (net of ECL  provision) of the financial asset.     Interest on delayed payments by customers are treated to accrue only on realisation, due to uncertainty of realisation  and are accounted accordingly.     Interest spread under par structure of direct assignment of loan receivables is recognised upfront. On derecognition  of the loan receivables in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount (measured at the date of  derecognition) and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed)  shall be recognised upfront in the statement of profit and loss. (II)    Dividend income     Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established. (III)    Rental income     Rental income arising from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In cases where  the increase is in line with expected general inflation, rental income is recognised as per the contractual terms.  (IV)    Fees and commission income      Fees and commissions are recognised when the Group satisfies the performance obligation, at the amount of  transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation based on a five-step  model as set out below, unless included in the effective interest calculation:      Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that  creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met.     Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with  a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer.     Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group  expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts  collected on behalf of third parties.     Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more  than one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in  an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for  satisfying each performance obligation.     Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.)

(V)    Net gain/ (loss) on fair value changes      Any differences between the fair values of financial assets classified as FVTPL (refer note 35), held by the Group on  the balance sheet date is recognised as an unrealised gain/loss. In cases there is a net gain in the aggregate, the same  is recognised in ‘net gains on fair value changes’ under revenue from operations and if there is a net loss the same  is disclosed under ‘expenses’ in the statement of profit and loss.     Similarly, any realised gain or loss on sale of financial instruments measured at FVTPL and debt or equity  instruments measured at FVTOCI is recognised in net gain/ loss on fair value changes. As at the reporting date, the  Group does not have any debt instruments measured at FVTOCI.  (VI)    Recoveries of financial assets written off     The Company recognises income on recoveries of financial assets written off on realisation basis. (VII)    Net gain/ loss on derecognition of financial instruments under amortised cost category     In case where transfer of a part of financial assets qualifies for de-recognition, any difference between the proceeds  received on such sale and the carrying value of the transferred asset is recognised as gain or loss on derecognition of  such financial asset previously carried under amortisation cost category is presented separately under the respective  head in the statement of profit and loss. The resulting interest only strip initially is recognised at FVTPL under  interest income.  (VIII)    Other incomes     All other incomes are recognised in the period they occur. 7.3      Expenses  (I)    Finance costs     Finance costs represents interest expense recognised by applying the (EIR) to the gross carrying amount of financial  liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL.     The EIR in case of a financial liability is computed:             a.            As the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial  liability to the gross carrying amount of the amortised cost of a financial liability.             b.     By considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument in estimating the cash flows.             c.            Including all fees paid between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the EIR, transaction costs,  and all other premiums or discounts.       Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest expense with the  corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial liability.     Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognised as part of the carrying value of the financial liability  and amortised over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions  payable to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, rating fee etc, provided these are incremental  costs that are directly related to the issue of a financial liability. (II)      Retirement and other employee benefits    a)   Short term employee benefit          All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short- term employee benefits. These benefits include short-term compensated absences such as paid annual leave.  The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services  rendered by employees is recognised as an expense during the period. Benefits such as salaries and wages, etc.  and the expected cost of the bonus/ ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the  related service. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 408 Annual Report 2024-25 

   b)   Post-employment employee benefits    (1)   Defined contribution schemes          All the employees of the Group are entitled to receive benefits under the Provident Fund and Employees  State Insurance scheme, defined contribution plans in which both the employee and the Group contribute  monthly at a stipulated rate. The Group has no liability for future benefits other than its annual contribution  and recognises such contributions as an expense in the period in which employee renders the related service.  If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the  contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received  before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead  to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.      (2)   Defined benefit schemes          The Group provides for the gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering all employees. The plan  provides for lump sum payments to employees upon death while in employment or on separation from  employment after serving for the stipulated years mentioned under ‘The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972’. The  present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plan is determined based on actuarial valuation,  carried out by an independent actuary at each balance sheet date, using the Projected Unit Credit Method,  which recognises each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of employee benefit entitlement  and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.            The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for  determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on  government securities as at the balance sheet date.             Net interest recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss is calculated by applying the discount rate used to  measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability or asset. The actual return on the  plan assets above or below the discount rate is recognised as part of re-measurement of net deﬁned liability or  asset through OCI. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, attrition rate, future salary  increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature,  these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed annually.          The Company fully contributes all ascertained liabilities to the Trustees - Shriram Finance Limited Employees  Group Gratuity Assurance Scheme. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust and contributions are  invested in a schemes of insurance with the IRDA approved insurance companies.          Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts  included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet  with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur.  They are not reclassiﬁed to the statement of proﬁt and loss in subsequent periods.        (i)   Other long-term employee benefits            Group’s liabilities towards compensated absences to employees are accrued on the basis of valuations,  as at the balance sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit  Method. Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments and the effects of changes in  actuarial assumptions and are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.          The Group presents the provision for compensated absences under provisions in the balance sheet.

       (ii)   Employee Share based payment        a)   Employee Stock Options            Eligible employees in terms of the Employees Stock Options Scheme of the Company receive  remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration  for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).             The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is  made using an appropriate valuation model.            That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in share option Outstanding Reserves  in equity, over the period in which the performance and/ or service conditions are fulfilled in employee  benefits expense/ vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions  at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired  and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.            The statement of profit and loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised  as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense. No expense  is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.        b)   Share appreciation rights (SAR) (cash-settled)            The cost of cash-settled scheme (stock appreciation rights) is measured initially using fair value method  at the grant date taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were  granted. This fair value is amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with recognition  of corresponding liability. This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date up to and including  the settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss in ‘Share  based payment to employees’ under the head Employee Benefit Expense. (III)    Leases    a)   The Group as a lessee            The Group has adopted Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ with the date of initial application being April 01, 2019 (transition  date). The determination of whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance  of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent  on the use of a specific asset or assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A contract  is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a time in  exchange for a consideration. The Group, at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a lease  or not lease. For arrangements entered into prior to April 01, 2019, the Group has determined whether the  arrangement contains a lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing on the date of transition.          The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right- of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an  estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on  which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using  the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.          The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate at the transition date in case  of leases existing as on the date of transition date and in case of leases entered after transition date, incremental  borrowing rate as on the date of lease commencement date. In case of existing leases, the said date would be  the date of transition. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change  in a rate, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option.  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 410 Annual Report 2024-25 

         When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount  of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in statement of profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero.          The Group has opted not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have  a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments  associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The Group’s lease asset class consisted of leases  for office premises and furniture and fixtures.         In case of a sub-lease, the Group accounts for its head lease and sub-lease separately.       b)    The Company as a lessor           Rental income arising from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line in the statement of profit and loss  over the lease term. In cases where the increase is in line with expected general inflation, rental income is  recognised as per the contractual terms.  (IV)    Other expenses     All other expenses are accounted in the period they are incurred. (V)    Impairment of non-financial assets, wherever applicable     The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset may be  impaired due to events or changes in circumstances indicating that their carrying amounts may not be realised.  If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. If such recoverable  amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The  reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance  sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount  is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the revised recoverable amount, subject to maximum of the depreciated  historical cost. (VI)    Taxes    a)   Current tax          Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be  recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount  are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date in the countries where the Group  operates and generates taxable income.          Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised either in  OCI or equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations  in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.    b)   Deferred tax          Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of  assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws)  that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the  related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.           Deferred tax assets are only recognised for temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits if  it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred  tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that  the related tax benefit will be realised. NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 411 Shriram Finance Limited 

         Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets  and liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on  different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets  and liabilities are realised simultaneously.      C)    Goods and Services Tax (GST) paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses        Expenses and assets are recognised net of the GST paid, except:        i.     When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority,  in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the  expense item, as applicable.                ii.          When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included.          The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables  or payables in the balance sheet. (VII)    Dividends on ordinary shares     The Group recognises a liability to make cash distributions to equity shareholders of the Group when the distribution  is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the Companies Act, 2013 the  final dividend is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders and interim dividend is authorised when it is  approved by the Board of Directors of the Group. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. 7.4      Foreign currency translation (I)    Functional and presentational currency       The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees which is also functional currency of the  Group and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.  (II)    Transactions and balances    a)   Initial recognition          Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing  at the dates of the transactions.    b)   Conversion          Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, which are outstanding as at the reporting  date, are translated at the reporting date at the closing exchange rate and the resultant exchange differences  are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.          Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot  exchange rates as at the date of recognition. 7.5      Cash and cash equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents comprise the net amount of short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible  to known amounts of cash (short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less) and are subject to an  insignificant risk of change in value, cheques on hand and balances with banks. They are held for the purposes of meeting  short-term cash commitments (rather than for investment or other purposes).      For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cheques on hand,  balances with banks (of the nature of cash and cash equivalents), CBLO and short-term deposits, as defined above. 7.6      Property, plant and equipment       Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are carried at historical cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and  accumulated impairment losses, (if any). The total cost of assets comprises its purchase price, freight, duties, taxes and  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 412 Annual Report 2024-25 

any other incidental expenses directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be  capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by  changing the depreciation period or methodology, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.       Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible asset are added to its gross value only if it increases the future  benefits of the existing asset, if it is probable that future economic benefit will flow to the Group from that expenditure and  cost can be measured reliably. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed off as and when incurred. (I)    Depreciation     Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of PPE to their residual values  over their estimated useful lives which is in line with the estimated useful life as specified in Schedule II of the  Companies Act, 2013 except for leasehold improvements which are amortised on a straight-line basis over the  period of lease or estimated period of useful life of such improvement, subject to a maximum period of 60 months.  Leasehold improvements include all expenditure incurred on the leasehold premises that have future economic  benefits. Land is not depreciated.     The estimated useful lives are as follows: Particulars Useful life as prescribed by  Schedule II of the Companies Act,  2013 Useful life estimated by Group Building 60 years  60 years  Plant and machinery 15 years 15 years Electrical equipment 10 years 10 years Generator  10 years 10 years Furniture and fixture 10 years  10 years  Air conditioner  5 years  5 years  Electronic equipment  5 years  5 years  Office equipment 5 years  5 years  Refrigerator  5 years  5 years  Motor car 8 years  8 years  Vehicles  10 years  10 years  Server and networking  6 years  6 years  Computer  3 years 3 years          Exceptions to useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013:    The vehicles provided to employees as part of Cost-To-Company (CTC) scheme are depreciated using estimated  useful life of 8 years without residual value.    The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, PPE are reviewed at each financial year  end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.    PPE is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or  loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the  carrying amount of the asset) is recognised in other income/ expense in the Statement of profit and loss in the year  the asset is derecognised.     Depreciation on assets acquired/ sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the statement of profit and  loss from/ upto the date of acquisition/ sale or disposal.    The date of disposal of an item of PPE is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the  requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts  with Customers.

7.7      Intangible assets       An intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that  the expected future  economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the Group.       Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises  its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use and net of  any trade discounts and rebates. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.       The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are  amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with  a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each balance sheet date. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern  of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period  or methodology, as appropriate, which are then treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on  intangible assets with finite lives is presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit and loss. Amortisation on  assets acquired/sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the statement of profit and loss from/ upto the date  of acquisition/ sale.       Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values  over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets comprising of software are amortised on a straight-line basis over a  period of 3 years, unless it has a shorter useful life.       Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated  impairment losses. The Company has determined the useful life of the distribution network acquired through the scheme  of amalgamation and started amortising the same over its useful life of 5 years.       Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. 7.8      Intangible assets under development       Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of balance sheet are disclosed as Intangible assets under  development. These are carried at cost, comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses. 7.9      Investment Property              A property, held to earn rentals and/ or capital appreciation are classified as investment property and measured and  reported at cost, including transaction costs.               Depreciation is recognised using straight line method so as to write off the cost of the investment property less their  residual values over their useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or in case of assets where the  useful life was determined by technical evaluation, over the useful life so determined. Depreciation method is reviewed at  each balance sheet date to reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future benefits embodied in the investment  property. The estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed at each financial year end and the effect of any  change in the estimates of useful life/ residual value is accounted on prospective basis.              An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from  use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of property  is recognised in the Statement of profit and loss in the same period. 7.10     Ind AS 101 - First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards    Exemptions applied               Ind AS 101 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under  Ind AS. The Company has applied the following exemptions: NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 414 Annual Report 2024-25 

      On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and  equipment, intangible assets and investment property as at March 31, 2017 measured as per the previous GAAP and use  that carrying value as the deemed cost of the property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property as  on April 01, 2017. 7.11     Provisions       Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events,  and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.        When the effect of the time value of money is material, the enterprise determines the level of provision by discounting  the expected cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflecting the current rates specific to the liability. The expense relating to any  provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. As at reporting date, the Group does  not have any such provisions where the effect of time value of money is material. 7.12     Contingent liabilities           A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be conﬁrmed by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present  obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the  obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised  because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in  the ﬁnancial statements. Contingent liabilities are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 7.13     Contingent Assets         A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.  Contingent assets are not recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements. They are disclosed only when an inflow of  economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 7.14     Earnings per Share (EPS)       The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 - Earnings per share. Basic EPS is  calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference  dividend and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.       For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders  and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential  equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have  been issued at a later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and  that either reduces the earnings per share or increases loss per share are included. The EPS and DPS of SHFL was disclosed  under ‘Discontinued Operations’. 7.15      Statement of Cash flows        Cash flows are reported under the ‘Indirect method’ as set out in Ind AS 7 on Statement of Cash Flows, whereby net profit  after tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature, tax and any deferrals or accruals of past or future  cash receipts or payments. The cash flows are prepared for the operating, investing and financing activities of the Group.  The respective cash flows of SHFL were presented under ‘Discontinued Operations’. 7.16      Business Combination       The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations where common control does not  exist. The consideration transferred by the Company for the acquisition of business comprises of fair value of the assets  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 415 Shriram Finance Limited 

transferred, liabilities incurred, and the equity interests issued by the Company as at the acquisition date i.e. the date on  which it obtains the control of the acquiree. The acquisition related costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss  as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.       Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on  the acquisition date.       Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at  their fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets as well as goodwill acquired in a  business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, respectively.       Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net  identifiable assets acquired. After initial recognition, goodwill is tested annually for impairment and any impairment loss  for goodwill is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.        Distribution network is the value of the transferor company’s branch network. Valuation of Distribution Network is as per  With and Without Method. If the consideration transferred is less than the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired, the  difference is recognised as capital reserve in other equity. 7.17      Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations       Non-current assets and disposable groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered  principally through a sale (rather than through continuing use) when the asset (or disposal Company) is available for  immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such asset (or  disposal group) and the sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one  year from the date of classification except in some circumstances this period can be extended if it is beyond the control of  management and there are sufficient evidence that the entity remains committed to its plan to sell the asset. Non-current  assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs  to sell.       An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain  is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative  impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current  asset is recognised at the date of derecognition.        Non-current assets are not depreciated or while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable  to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised. Non-current assets classified as  held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified  as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.       A discontinued operations is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that  represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is a part of a single co-ordinated plan to  dispose of such line of business or area of business of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view of  resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit and loss. 7.18      Exceptional items       Exceptional items are those items of income or expense from ordinary activities which are non-recurring and are of such  size, nature or incidence that their separate disclosure in the financial statements is considered necessary to explain the  performance of the group. 8 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS       The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with the Ind AS requires the management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 416 Annual Report 2024-25 

accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the management’s  best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the  outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods in which changes  are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.       In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting  policies that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the  following notes: 8.1      Business Model Assessment       Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The  Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve  a particular business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the  performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets  and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Group monitors financial assets  measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their  disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring  is part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for which the remaining financial assets are  held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a  prospective change to the classification of those assets. 8.2      Deﬁned employee beneﬁt assets and liabilities       The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial  valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in  the future. These include the determination of the discount rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed annually. 8.3      Fair value measurement       When the fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based  on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these  models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required  in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.  Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of ﬁnancial instruments. 8.4      Impairment of loans portfolio       The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement, when determining  impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of  factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances.       It has been the Group’s policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when  necessary. The policy on impairment loss on loans and advances is disclosed in detail in note 7.1(VI). 8.5      Contingent liabilities and provisions other than impairment on loan portfolio        Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of  funds resulting from past operations or events and the amount of cash outflow can be reliably estimated. The timing of  recognition and quantification of the liability requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances,  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 417 Shriram Finance Limited 

which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed at each balance sheet date  and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances. 8.6      Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method       The Group’s EIR methodology, recognises interest income/ expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate  of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given/ taken and recognises the effect of potentially  different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and  penalty interest and charges).       This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the  instruments, as well expected changes to India’s base rate and other fee income/ expense that are integral parts of the  instrument. 8.7      Estimating the incremental borrowing rate       The Group uses its Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the  Group would have to pay to for its incremental borrowings. 8.8      Other estimates       These include contingent liabilities, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets etc. The Group has determined the useful  life of the intangible asset in the nature of branch network acquired through the scheme of amalgamation and started  amortising the same over its useful life by making a suitable change in the accounting estimate.

The primary risks managed using  derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group’s risk management strategy and how it is  applied to manage risk are explained in note 58. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments The Group designates its derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly  probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. At inception of designated  hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. 10 BANK BALANCE OTHER THAN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  ( Contd .) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 420 Annual Report 2024-25 

The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including  whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other. There is  an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the terms of the cross currency swap  contract match that of the foreign currency borrowing (notional amount, interest payment dates, principal repayment date  etc.). The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the hedging  instruments is identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical  derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value  of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. Cash  flow  hedges             When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the  derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in other equity under ‘effective portion of cash flow hedges’. The effective  portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair  value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of  changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.   Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments There are no undesignated derivatives. Notes: 1)     The interest rate risk and exchange rate risk on the borrowings of the Group are managed using various derivative  instruments which are entered into from time to time. The risk management strategy and the use of derivatives are  explained  in  Note  58.            2)      The Group has designated the interest rate derivatives which were entered to mitigate interest rate risks on its  external commercial bond, external commercial borrowings, term loan from banks and institutions and non- convertible debentures as hedging instruments.

32 OTHER EQUITY  ( Contd .) Nature and purpose of reserves       a)      Share application money pending allotment:  The amount received on the application for equity shares of the  Company on which allotment is not yet made, to the extent not refundable.      b)      Securities  premium:  The amount received in excess of face value of the equity shares is recognised in securities  premium. In case of equity-settled share based payment transactions, the difference between fair value on grant date  and nominal value of share is accounted as securities premium. The reserve can be utilised only for limited purposes  such as issuance of bonus shares in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.      c)       Capital  reserve:  Capital reserve is the excess of net assets taken over cost of consideration paid during  amalgamation.       d)      Capital redemption reserve:  The Company has recognised capital redemption reserve on redemption of non- convertible redeemable preference shares from its retained earnings. The amount in capital redemption reserve is  equal to nominal amount of the non-convertible redeemable preference shares redeemed. The Company may issue  fully paid up bonus shares to its members out of the capital redemption reserve.       e)    Debenture redemption reserve (DRR):         (1)     Pursuant to Section 71 of the Companies Act, 2013 and circular 04/2013, read with notiﬁcation issued date  June 19, 2016 issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Company is required to transfer 25% of the value  of the outstanding debentures issued through public issue as per the present SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt  Securities) Regulation, 2008 to Debenture redemption reserve (DRR) and no DRR is required in case of  privately placed debenture. Also the Company is required  before 30th day of April of each year to deposit  or invest, as the case may be, a sum which shall not be less than 15% of the amount of its debenture issued  through public issue maturing within one year from the balance sheet date.         (2)     As per the notification G.S.R. 574(E) dated August 16, 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has amended  the Companies (Share Capital & Debentures) Rules, DRR need not be created for debentures issued by a Non- Banking Finance Company subsequent to the notification date. The Company has not created DRR on public  issue of non-convertible debentures issued after the date of said notification.         (3)     In respect of the debentures issued through public issue, the Company has created DRR of Rs. 18.41 crores  (March 31, 2024: Rs. 53.32 crores). The Company subsequent to the year end has deposited a sum of Rs. Nil  (March 31, 2024: Rs. 60.00 crores) in the form of ﬁxed deposits with scheduled banks, representing 15% of the  debenture issued through public issue, which are due for redemption within one year from the balance sheet  date.         (4)     On redemption of the debentures for which the DRR is created, the amounts no longer necessary to be  retained in this account need to be transferred to the retained earnings.       f)       General reserve:  Under the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956, general reserve was created through an annual transfer  of net income at a specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations. Consequent to introduction of  Companies Act, 2013, the requirement to mandatorily transfer a specified percentage of the net profit to general  reserve has been withdrawn. However, the amount previously transferred to the general reserve can be utilised  only in accordance with the specific requirements of Companies Act, 2013.      g)     Statutory reserve:            Statutory reserve (SFL):  Every year the Company transfers a sum of not less than twenty per cent of net profit of  that year as disclosed in the statement of  profit and loss to its Statutory Reserve pursuant to Section 45-IC of the  RBI Act, 1934.

    (1)     Every Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) shall create a reserve fund and transfer therein a sum not  less than twenty per cent of its net profit every year as disclosed in the profit and loss account and before any  dividend is declared.      (2)     No appropriation of any sum from the reserve fund shall be made by the NBFC except for the purpose as may  be specified by the RBI from time to time and every such appropriation shall be reported to the RBI within  twenty-one days from the date of such withdrawal:             Provided that the RBI may, in any particular case and for sufficient cause being shown, extend the period of  twenty-one days by such further period as it thinks fit or condone any delay in making such report.        (3)     Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the  Central Government may, on the recommendation  of the RBI and having regard to the adequacy of the paid-up capital and reserves of a NBFC in relation to its  deposit liabilities, declare by order in writing that the provisions of sub-section (1) shall not be applicable to  the NBFC for such period as may be specified in the order:              Provided  that  no  such  order  shall  be  made  unless  the  amount  in  the  reserve fund under sub-section  (1) together with the amount in the share premium  account  is  not  less  than  the  paid-up  capital  of  the    NBFC.          Statutory Reserve (SHFL):  The subsidiary company creates Special Reserve every year out of its profits in  terms of Section 36(1) (viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 read with Section 29C of the National Housing  Bank Act, 1987. The Subsidiary Company transfers  at least 20% of the Profit after tax  to the Statutory  reserve.      h)        Amalgamation  adjustment  account:  Upon amalgamation of the erstwhile Shriram City Union Finance (SCUF)  the transferor company, with Shriram Transport Finance Limited (STFC) the transferee company, renamed as  Shriram Finance Limited (SFL), the statutory reserves (i.e. Reserve under Section 45-IC of the Reserve Bank of  India Act, 1934) of Rs. 1,706.81 crores of the transferor companies as on April 01, 2022 (the appointed date) were  recorded in the books of SFL with a corresponding debit to amalgamation adjustment account. When the identity  of the statutory reserves were no longer required to be maintained, the aforesaid account was reversed in the  financial year  2023-24.    i)      Share option outstanding:  The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity- settled share-based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their  remuneration.      j)       Remeasurement gain/ (loss) on defined benefit plan:  Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses  and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are  recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through  OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the statement of profit and loss in  subsequent periods.       k)      Other comprehensive income:  Other comprehensive income includes effective portion of cash flow hedges and  gain/ (loss) on fair valuation of investments in quoted equity shares.             Effective portion of cash flow hedges represents the cumulative effective portion of gains or losses arising on  changes in fair value of hedging instruments entered into for cash flow hedges, which shall be reclassified to the  statement of  profit and loss only when the hedged transaction affects the statement of  profit and loss, or included as  a basis adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent with the Company accounting policies.             Gain/ (loss) on fair valuation of investments in quoted equity shares represents gains and losses from the change  in the fair value of investments in quoted equity instruments in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5 of Ind AS 109,  Financial Instruments.       l)       Retained  earnings:  Retained earnings are the profits that the Group has earned till date, less any transfers to  statutory reserve, general reserve, dividend distributed to shareholders and other appropriations.   32 OTHER EQUITY  ( Contd .)

Shriram Finance Limited (“the Company”): a)    Defined contribution plan    A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions; there is no legal or  constructive obligation to pay further contributions. The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Company  in a fund under the control of trustees.       The Company makes Provident Fund and Employee State Insurance Scheme contributions which are deﬁned contribution  plans for qualifying employees. Under the schemes, the Company is required to contribute a speciﬁed percentage of  the payroll costs to fund the beneﬁts. The Company recognised Rs. 168.20 crores (March 31, 2024: Rs. 148.38 crores)  for Provident Fund contributions and Rs. 29.12 crores (March 31, 2024: Rs. 29.92 crores) for Employee State Insurance  Scheme contributions in the statement of proﬁt and loss. The contributions payable to these plans by the Company are at  rates speciﬁed in the rules of the schemes.

b)    Defined benefit plan Gratuity   The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded). The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act,  1972. Under the act, employee who has completed five years of service is entitled to specific benefit. The level of benefits  provided depends on the employee’s length of service and last drawn salary. The fund is managed by third party fund  managers. Each year, the Board of Trustees reviews the level of funding in the gratuity plan. Such a review includes the asset-liability  matching strategy and investment risk management policy. This includes employing the use of annuities and longevity  swaps to manage the risks. The Board of Trustees decides contribution to be made by the Company based on the results  of this annual review. The trust is in process of investing entire funds in government securities through third party fund  managers and as on March 31, 2025,  84.35% funds are invested in government securities and balance 15.65% funds are  invested in money market and corporate debt instruments. The Board of Trustees aim to keep annual contributions of the  Company relatively stable at a level such that no plan deficits (based on valuation performed) will arise.  The following tables summarises the components of net beneﬁt expense recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss and  the funded status and amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the gratuity plan.

The estimate of future salary increase takes into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors. Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government Bonds as at the balance sheet date for the  estimated term of the obligation. B.     Shriram Housing Finance Limited (“SHFL”) (upto December 11, 2024):           a)    Defined contribution plan             SHFL makes Provident Fund and Employee State Insurance Scheme contributions which are deﬁned contribution plans,  for qualifying employees. Under the schemes, SHFL is required to contribute a speciﬁed percentage of the payroll costs to  fund the beneﬁts. SHFL recognized Rs. 5.79 crores for the period ended December 11, 2024 (Rs. 7.19 crores for the year  ended March 31, 2024) for Provident Fund contributions and Rs. 0.24 crores for the period ended December 11, 2024 (Rs.  0.39 crores for the year ended March 31, 2024) for Employee State Insurance Scheme contributions in the statement of  proﬁt and loss. The contributions payable to these plans by SHFL are at rates speciﬁed in the rules of the schemes. b)    Defined benefit plan     Gratuity       SHFL has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has completed five years of service is eligible for a gratuity  on separation at 15 days basic salary (last drawn salary) for each completed year of service. The scheme is funded with the  insurance companies in the form of qualifying insurance policy.   During the year 2015-16, SHFL created “Shriram Housing Finance Company Employees’ Group Gratuity Fund”. The Trust  is recognised by income tax authorities and administered through trustees. Contributions to the Trust are invested in a  scheme with a insurance Company as permitted by law in India.    The following tables summarise the components of net beneﬁt expense recognized in the statement of proﬁt and loss and the  funded status and amounts recognized in the balance sheet for the gratuity plan.           Through its defined benefit plans, SHFL is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:     1.    Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond  yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.     2.    Salary Inflation risk: Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.   NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 476 Annual Report 2024-25 

    3.    Demographic risk: This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include  mortality, withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not  straight forward and depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important  not to overstate withdrawals because in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically  costs less per year as compared to a long service employee.       4.    Investment risk: For funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the  insurer may not be the fair value of instruments backing the liability. In such cases, the present value of the assets is  independent of the future discount rate. This can result in wide fluctuations in the net liability or the funded status if  there are significant changes in the discount rate during the inter-valuation period.     5.    Legislative risk: Legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to change  in the legislation/ regulation. The government may amend the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, thus requiring the  companies to pay higher benefits to the employees. This will directly affect the present value of the defined benefit  obligation and the same will have to be recognized immediately in the year when any such amendment is effective.

Note 54.01: Emolyee stock option plan (ESOP Scheme) 54.01.01: About the plan       Shriram Finance Limited Employee Stock Options Scheme 2023 (No.1) [“SFL ESOS 2023(No.1)”] has been created in lieu  of the erstwhile SCUF ESOS 2013 to issue stock options to the eligible employees of the SCUF (“Transferor Company”)  taking into account the share exchange ratio as provided in terms of clause 3.36.1 of the approved Composite Scheme of  Arrangement and Amalgamation (“Scheme”). The objective of SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan is that the eligible employees  of the Transferor Company continue to enjoy the benefit of stock options upon becoming the employees of the Company  and to restore the value of options post amalgamation in the manner provided in terms of Clause 3.35.17 of the Scheme.  This SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan has been adopted on March 15, 2023 by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee  and Board of directors of the Company.

The maximum period of vesting shall be 5 years from the date of grant. The period during which the options granted by the Transferor Company under SCUF ESOS 2013 plan were held by the  eligible employee shall be adjusted against the minimum vesting period. That is, the date of vesting under the SCUF ESOS  2013 plan shall be considered as the vesting date under SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan. The exercise price shall be Rs.193.55 per fresh options under the SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) plan. The options vested shall be exercised within period of ten years from the vesting date. When exercisable, each option  is convertible into one equity share. Any option granted shall be exercisable according to the terms and conditions as  determined by the Scheme. 54.01.02: Fair value of the options granted   The Company has recorded employee share-based compensation expense relating to the SFL ESOS 2023 (No.1) options on  the basis of fair value of erstwhile SCUF ESOS 2013 options. The fair value of the options granted is mentioned below as per vesting period. The fair value of the options is determined  using Black-Scholes model which takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option (time to maturity), the share  NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 494 Annual Report 2024-25

Share Price The latest available closing market price on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) date on which options are granted  under SCUF ESOS 2023 plan has been considered for the purpose of valuation. b.     Volatility           Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period. The  measure of volatility used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is the annualised standard deviation of the  continuously compounded rates of return on the stock over a period of time. The period to be considered for volatility must be adequate to represent a consistent trend in the price movements.  Accordingly, the annualised volatility has been computed based on the share price data of past one year, from the date  of the valuation. The fair value is very sensitive to this variable. Higher the volatility, higher is the fair value. The rationale being, the  more volatile a stock is, the more is its potential to go up (or come down), and the more is the probability to gain from  the movement in the price. Accordingly, an option to buy a highly volatile stock is more valuable than the one to buy  a less volatile stock, since the probability of gaining is lesser in the latter case. c.     Risk-free  interest  rate            The risk-free interest rate being considered for the calculation is the interest rate applicable on government securities  having 10 year maturity period. d.     Exercise  price           Exercise price of the options granted is as per SCUF ESOS 2023 plan.   e.     Time to maturity/ expected life of options                 Time to maturity/ expected life of options is the period from the grant date to the date on which option is expected to  be exercised. The minimum life of share option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised  and maximum life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised. 54 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS  ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 495 Shriram Finance Limited 

Considering the deep discount on the market price i.e. 55% to 70%, it is expected that the options will be exercised in  1 year from the vesting date. As such the average expected life of options is considered at 2 years. 54.01.04: Effect of the employee share-based payment plans on the statement of profit and loss and on its financial position     The Company has recorded employee share-based compensation cost of Rs. Nil in the statement of profit and loss for the  financial year ended March 31, 2025 (March 31, 2024: Rs. 9.17 crores).

The primary objectives of the Group’s capital management policy are to ensure that the Group complies with externally  imposed capital requirements and maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business  and to maximise shareholder value.       The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it according to changes in economic conditions and the  risk characteristics of its activities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount  of dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. No changes have been  made to the objectives, policies and processes from the previous years except those incorporated on account of regulatory  amendments. However, they are under constant review by the Board. 57 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 57.01: Valuation principle       Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the  principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price),  regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair  values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as explained in  material accounting policies of the year ended March 31, 2025.

These instruments are valued by either observable foreign exchange rates, observable  or calculated forward points and option valuation models. With the exception of contracts where a directly observable  rate is available which are disclosed as Level-1, the Group classifies derivative financial instruments as Level-2 financial  instruments when no unobservable inputs are used for their valuation or the unobservable inputs used are not significant  to the measurement (as a whole).  57 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 501 Shriram Finance Limited 

    Investments in mutual funds/ equity instruments     Investment in units of mutual funds are measured based on their published Net Asset Value (NAV), taking into account  redemption and/ or other restrictions. Such instruments are generally Level-1. Equity instruments in non-listed entities  are initially recognised at transaction price and re-measured (to the extent information is available) and valued on a case- by-case and classified as Level-3. Quoted equity instruments on recognised stock exchanges are valued at Level-1 hierarchy  being the unadjusted quoted price as the reporting date.       Government securities      Investment in government securities held for trading are measured based on latest quoted price available at platform  notified by the regulator.    Certificate of Deposits (CDs)     Certificate of deposits are short-term financial instruments issued by banks. Financial Benchmark India Private Limited  (FBIL) has developed the FBIL-CD, a new benchmark for the money market based on traded CDs reported on the  FIMMDA Trade Reporting and Confirmation System (FTRAC) platform of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL).  FBIL-CD is announced for seven tenors of 14 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. For  valuation, the Group uses FBIL-CD benchmark and based on that benchmark the Group interpolates and calculates CD  prices corresponding to their residual maturities and such instruments are classified as Level 2.    Venture capital fund     Investment in venture capital fund are measured based on net asset value basis. 57.04: Transfer between fair value hierarchy levels     During the financial year there were no transfers between Level-1 and Level-2.      57.05: Movements in Level-3 financial instruments measured at fair value     The following tables show a reconciliation of the opening and closing amounts of Level-3 financial assets and liabilities  which are recorded at fair value. Transfers from Level-3 to Level-2 occur when the market for some securities became more  liquid, which eliminates the need for the previously required significant unobservable valuation inputs. Since the transfer,  these instruments have been valued using valuation models incorporating observable market inputs. Transfers into Level-3  reflect changes in market conditions as a result of which instruments become less liquid. Therefore, the Group requires  significant unobservable inputs to calculate their fair value. The following tables show the reconciliation of the opening and closing amounts of Level-3 financial assets and liabilities  measured at fair value: (Rs. in crores) Particulars  Equity instruments As at    March 31, 2025   As at    March 31, 2024  Opening balance  25.82   25.40  Purchase   -      -    Sales   -      -    Issuances   -      -    Settlements   -      -    Transfers into Level-3   -      -    Transfers from Level-3   -      -    Net interest income, net trading income and other income   -      -    Other comprehensive income   -      -    Unrealised gains and losses related to balances held at the end of the year  1.85   0.42  Closing balance  27.67   25.82  57 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 502 Annual Report 2024-25 

57.06: Impact of changes to key assumptions on fair value of Level-3 financial instruments measured at fair value        The table summarises the valuation techniques together with the significant unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair  value of the Group’s Level-3 assets and liabilities. The range of values indicates the highest and lowest level input used in the  valuation technique and, as such, only reflects the characteristics of the instruments as opposed to the level of uncertainty  to their valuation. Relationships between unobservable inputs have not been incorporated in this summary.

All  changes would be reflected in the statement of profit and loss. Sensitivity data are calculated using a number of techniques,  including analysing price dispersion of different price sources, adjusting model inputs to reasonable changes within the  fair  value  methodology.             The ranges are not comparable or symmetrical as the model inputs are usually not in the middle of the favourable/  unfavourable  range.             The table below shows data in relation to Level-3 inputs that are already aggregated on the underlying product levels  without assuming any potential diversification effect, but including potential off-sets from economic or accounting hedge  relationships in place. The Group is of the opinion that, whilst there may be some diversification benefits, incorporating  these would not be significant to the analysis.

These fair values were calculated for disclosure  purposes only. The below methodologies and assumptions relate only to the instruments in the above tables. Instruments  with no comparable instruments or valuation inputs are classified as Level 3. 57 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 504 Annual Report 2024-25 

    Short-term financial assets and liabilities     For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts,  which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such instruments include trade receivables,  other receivables, balances other than cash and cash equivalents (other than deposits with banks), trade payables, other  payables and other financial liabilities without a specific maturity.     Bank deposits and receivable from trusts on account of securitisation                  The fair value of bank deposits and receivable from trusts on account of securitisation has been determined using the  discounted cash flow method. The discount rates used are based on the prevailing interest rates offered by the State Bank  of India (SBI) for fixed deposits with comparable maturities as on the reporting date.     Loans and advances to customers              The fair values of loans and receivables are estimated by discounted cash flow models based on contractual cash flows using  weighted average interest rates for the disbursements done during the last quarter of the financial year.      Pass  through  certificates             These instruments include asset backed securities. The market for these securities is not active. The fair values of pass  through certificates are estimated by discounted cash flow models based on contractual cash flows using weighted average  interest rates for the deals entered during the last quarter of the financial year.            Investment in associate at cost                 As per Ind AS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, interest in associate are recognised at cost and not adjusted  to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Cost represents amount paid for acquisition of the said investments. The  Group assesses at the end of each reporting period, if there are any indications that the said investments may be impaired.  If so, the Group estimates the recoverable value/ amount of the investment and provides for impairment, if any i.e. the  deficit in the recoverable value over cost.    Investment in government securities at amortised cost                 The fair values of held-to-maturity investments in government securities are measured based on latest quoted price  available at platform notified by the regulator.                Issued  debt  and  borrowings            The fair value of issued debt and borrowings is estimated by discounted cash flow models based on contractual cash flows  using weighted average interest rates for the deals entered into during the last quarter of the financial year.    Deposits              The fair value of public deposits and deposit from corporates is estimated by discounted cash flow models based on  contractual cash flows using weighted average interest rates for the deposits accepted during the last quarter of the financial  year.    Other financial assets             The fair value of other financial assets (other than receivable from trusts on account of securitisation)  have been measured  under Level-3 at fair value based on discounted cash flow model.              Off-balance sheet positions             Estimated fair values of off-balance sheet positions are based on the carrying amounts due to the short-term maturities of  these  positions.           The carrying value of financial instruments by categories is as follows: (Rs. in crores) As at March 31, 2025  Amortised  cost Derivative  instruments  in hedging  relationship At fair  value   through  OCI At fair value  through  profit or loss Others     (at cost) Total Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents  10,681.40    -      -      -      -     10,681.40  Bank balance other than cash and  cash equivalents  10,684.34    -      -      -      -     10,684.34  57 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.)

This process of risk  management is critical to the Group’s continuing profitability and each individual within the Group is accountable for the  risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. It  is also subject to various operating and business risks.  57 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 506 Annual Report 2024-25 

58.01:  Introduction and risk profile 58.01.01: Risk management structure     The Board of Directors are responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk management  strategies  and  principles.            The Board has constituted the Risk Management Committee (RMC) which is responsible for monitoring the overall  risk process within the Company. The RMC has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and  implementing principles, frameworks, policies and limits. It is responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring  risk levels. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for implementing and maintaining risk related procedures to ensure an  independent control process is maintained. The risk owners within each department will report to the RMC.         The risk owners are responsible for monitoring compliance with risk principles, policies and limits across the Group.  Each department has its risk owner who is responsible for the control of risks, including monitoring the actual risk of  exposures against authorised limits and the assessment of risks. The Group’s treasury is responsible for managing its assets  and liabilities and the overall financial structure. It is also primarily responsible for the funding and liquidity risks of the  Group.              The Group’s policy is that risk management processes throughout the Group are audited annually by the internal audit  function, which examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Group’s compliance with the procedures. Internal  audit discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to RMC.     58.01.02: Risk mitigation and risk culture     As part of its overall risk management, the Group can use derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures resulting  from changes in interest rates and foreign currencies associated with foreign currency transactions.         58.01.03: Risk measurement and reporting systems            The Group’s risks are measured using a method that reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances  and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss. The models make use of probabilities derived from  historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment, as necessary.               The Group’s policy is to measure and monitor the overall risk-bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure  across all risk types and activities.               Information compiled from all the departments is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify risks  on a timely basis. This information is presented and explained to the RMC and the head of each department.      The RMC receives a comprehensive risk report once a quarter which is designed to provide all the necessary information  to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group.               It is the Group’s policy to ensure that a robust risk awareness is embedded in its organisational risk culture. Employees  are expected to take ownership and be accountable for the risks the Group is exposed to that they decide to take on. The  Group’s continuous training and development emphasises that employees are made aware of the Group’s risk appetite and  they are supported in their roles and responsibilities to monitor and keep their exposure to risk within the Group’s risk  appetite limits. Compliance breaches and internal audit findings are important elements of employees annual ratings and  remuneration  reviews.            58.01.04: Excessive risk concentration            Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same  geographical region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be  similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.                In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus  on spreading its lending portfolio across all the states with a cap on maximum limit of exposure for a state and also for an  individual/ Group.       58.02:  Credit risk             Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers or counterparties fail to discharge their  contractual obligations. The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to  accept for individual counterparties and for geographical concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such  limits.              Credit risk is monitored by the credit  department of the Group. It is their responsibility to review and manage credit risk,  including environmental and social risk for all types of counterparties. Credit risk consists of line credit managers who are  58 RISK MANAGEMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 507 Shriram Finance Limited 

responsible for their business lines and manage specific portfolios and experts who support both the line credit  manager,  as well as the business with tools like credit risk systems, policies, models and reporting.           The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the  creditworthiness of counterparties. The credit quality review process aims to allow the Group to assess the potential loss as  a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective actions.                The Group’s internal credit rating grades on days past due(dpd) basis:           Internal rating grade Internal rating description Performing High grade 0 dpd Standard grade 1 to 30 dpd Sub-standard grade 31 to 60 dpd Past due but not impaired 61 to 89 dpd Non-performing 90 and above dpd 58.02.01: Derivative financial instruments           Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as  recorded on the balance sheet. With gross-settled derivatives, the Group is also exposed to a settlement risk, being the risk  that the Group honours its obligation, but the counterparty fails to deliver the counter value.   58.02.02:  Impairment  assessment        The references below show where the Group’s impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this report.  It should be read in conjunction with the summary of material accounting policies.          The Group’s definition and assessment of default (Refer note 58.02.02.01).            -      How the Group defines, calculates and monitors the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given  default (Refer notes 58.02.02.01 to 58.02.02.04)              -    When the Group considers there has been a significant increase in credit risk of an exposure (Refer note 58.02.02.05)    -    The Group’s policy of segmenting financial assets where ECL is assessed on a collective basis (Refer note 58.02.02.07)    -      The details of the ECL calculations and categorisation of loans for stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 assets (Refer note  7.1(VI)) 58.02.02.01: Definition of default        The Group considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL calculations in all  cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.            As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Group also considers a variety of instances that  may indicate unlikeliness to pay. When such events occur, the Group carefully considers whether the event should result in  treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether stage 2 is appropriate.  Such events include:              -    The borrower requesting emergency funding from the Group.             -      A material decrease in the underlying collateral value where the recovery of the loan is expected from the sale of  the  collateral.          -    A covenant breach not waived by the Group.             -    The debtor (or any legal entity within the debtor’s Group) filing for bankruptcy application/ protection.   -    Repossession of security             -      All the facilities of a borrower are treated as stage 3 when one of his facility becomes 90 days past due i.e. credit  impaired.          -    The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise.   58.02.02.02: Probability of Default (PD) estimation process        It is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. PD estimation process is done based on historical  internal data available with the Group. While arriving at the PD, the Group also ensures that the factors that affects the  macro economic trends are considered to a reasonable extent, wherever necessary. The Group calculates the 12 month PD  by taking into account the past historical trends of the portfolio and its credit performance. In case of assets where there is  a significant increase in credit risk, lifetime PD has been applied which is computed based on survival analysis. For credit  impaired assets, a PD of 100% has been applied. 58 RISK MANAGEMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 508 Annual Report 2024-25 

58.02.02.03: Exposure at Default (EAD)        The exposure at default (EAD) represents the gross carrying amount of the financial instruments subject to the impairment  calculation, addressing both the ability to increase its exposure while approaching default and potential early repayments  too.          To calculate the EAD for a stage 1 loan, the Group assesses the possible default events within 12 months for the calculation  of the 12 months ECL.            For stage 2 and stage 3 financial assets, the exposure at default is considered for events over the lifetime of the  instruments.         In case of undrawn loan commitments, a credit conversion factor of 100% is applied for expected drawdown.  58.02.02.04: Loss Given Default (LGD)        LGD is an estimate of the loss arising in case where a default occurs. It is based on the difference between the contractual  cash flows due and those that the Group would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any security. 58.02.02.05: Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)        The Group continuously monitors all assets subject to ECLs in order to determine whether an instrument or a portfolio of  instruments is subject to 12 month ECL or lifetime ECL. The Group assesses whether there has been an event which could  cause a significant increase in the credit risk of the underlying asset or the customer’s ability to pay and accordingly change  the 12 month ECL to a lifetime ECL.           In certain cases, the Group may also consider that events explained in Note 58.02.02.01 are a significant increase in credit  risk as opposed to a default. Regardless of the above, if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, the credit risk  is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition.            When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a Group of similar assets (as set out in Note 58.02.02.07), the Group applies  the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.   58.02.02.06: Forward looking information        As explained in note 7.1.(VI), the Group has incorporated forward looking information and macro-economic factors  while calculating PD and LGD rate.           58.02.02.07: Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis        As explained in note 7.1.(VI) the Group calculates ECLs only on a collective basis. The Group segments the exposure into  smaller homogeneous portfolios, based on a combination of internal and external characteristics of the loans as given  below.          1)     Commercial vehicles      2)     Construction equipments         3)     Farm equipments     4)     Passenger vehicles        5)     Gold loans 6)     Personal loans  7)     MSME secured 8)     MSME unsecured 9)     Loans to NBFC 10)   Two wheelers         58.02.03: Analysis of risk concentration        The maximum credit exposure to any individual client or counterparty as of March 31, 2025 was Rs. 50.52 crores (March  31, 2024: Rs. 63.10 crores).

58.03:  Liquidity risk and funding management     In assessing the Group’s liquidity position, consideration shall be given to:                1)     Present and anticipated asset quality               2)     Present and future earnings capacity                3)     Historical funding requirements              4)     Current liquidity position               5)     Anticipated future funding needs, and               6)     Sources of funds     The Group maintains a portfolio of marketable assets that are assumed to be easily liquidated and undrawn cash credit limits  which can be used in the event of an unforeseen interruption in cash flow. The Group also enters into securitisation deals  (direct assignment as well as pass through certificates) of their loan portfolio, the funding from which can be accessed to  meet liquidity needs. In accordance with the Group’s policy, the liquidity position is assessed under a variety of scenarios,  giving due consideration to stress factors relating to both the market in general and specifically to the Group. Net liquid  assets consist of cash, short-term bank deposits and investments in mutual fund available for immediate sale, less issued  securities and borrowings due to mature within the next month. Borrowings from banks and financial institutions, issue of  debentures and bonds and acceptance of public deposits are considered as important sources of funds to finance lending to  customers. They are monitored using the advances to borrowings ratio, which compares loans and advances to customers  as a percentage of secured and unsecured borrowings.       The Board of Directors approves constitution of Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO). It reviews or monitors  Asset Liability Management (ALM) mismatch. It conducts periodic reviews relating to the liquidity position and stress test  assuming various what if scenarios. The ALCO is responsible for ensuring adherence to the limits set by the Board as well  as for deciding the business strategy of the Company in line with the Company’s budget and decided risk management  objectives. It is a decision-making unit responsible for balance sheet planning from risk-return perspective including  strategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks. It also evaluates the borrowing plan of subsequent quarters on  the basis of previous borrowings of the Company. It will be responsible for ensuring the adherence to the target set by  the Board of Directors. The meetings of ALCO are held at quarterly intervals. The ALM support groups, consisting of  operating staff are responsible for analysing, monitoring and reporting the risk profiles to the ALCO. The ALCO support  group meets every fortnight. The minutes of ALCO meetings are placed before the RMC and the Board of Directors in its  next meeting for its ratification. 58 RISK MANAGEMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 510 Annual Report 2024-25 

58.03.01: Analysis of financial assets and liabilities by remaining maturities The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities as at the reporting date. All derivatives used for hedging and natural hedges are  shown by maturity. Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately. However, the Group expects that many customers will not request  repayment on the earliest date it could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by its deposit retention history.

58.04:  Market risk Market risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables  such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either  trading or non-trading portfolios and manages each of those portfolios separately.     58.04.01: Interest rate risk   The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates to the Group’s outstanding floating rate liabilities. Most of the  Company’s outstanding liability is on fixed rate basis and hence not subject to interest rate risk. Some of the borrowings of  the Company are linked to rate benchmarks such as Bank Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) or Secured  Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), RBI Repo Rate, Treasury Bill Linked Lending Rate (TBLR) and Mumbai Inter-Bank  Overnight Indexed Swap (MIOIS) and hence subject to interest rate risk. The Group hedges interest rate risks of foreign  currency borrowings through derivative transactions. The sensitivity of the Company’s floating rate borrowings to change  in interest rate (assuming all other variables constant) is given below: (Rs. in crores) Particulars As at March 31, 2025  As at March 31, 2024 Carrying  amount  Favourable  change 1%  increase   Unfavourable  change 1%  decrease  Carrying  amount  Favourable  change 1%  increase   Unfavourable  change 1%  decrease  Debt instrument  650.00   69.01   (87.61)  1,246.11   88.83   (109.21) Term loans  20,502.47   1,990.99   (2,474.15)  29,127.25   1,905.71   (2,355.41) Total floating rate  borrowings  21,152.47   2,060.00   (2,561.76)  30,373.36   1,994.54   (2,464.62)     Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments     The Group’s fixed rate instruments are carried at amortised cost and are not measured for interest rate risk, as neither the  carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.      Inter-Bank Offered Rate (IBOR) reform               The U.S. Dollar LIBOR bank panel ended on June 30, 2023, and therefore the exposure with the Group was transitioned  from LIBOR to SOFR. There was no exposure to IBOR risk as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024.          Most of the Group’s outstanding loans are on fixed rate basis and hence not subject to interest rate risk. The Group’s  exposure to changes in interest rates relates to the Group’s outstanding floating rate loans hence subject to interest rate risk.  The sensitivity of the Group’s floating rate loans to change in interest rate (assuming all other variables constant) is given  below:   As at March 31, 2025 (Rs. in crores) Particulars  Carrying amount  Favourable change 1%  increase   Unfavourable change 1%  decrease  Total floating rate loans - - - As at March 31, 2024 (Rs. in crores) Particulars  Carrying amount  Favourable change 1%  increase  Unfavourable change 1%  decrease Loans  5,175.55   (51.76)  51.76  Total floating rate loans  5,175.55   (51.76)  51.76  58 RISK MANAGEMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 514 Annual Report 2024-25 

58.04.02: Foreign currency risk            Foreign Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange  rates. The Group is exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk for its foreign currency borrowing. The Group’s borrowings  in foreign currency are governed by RBI Master Direction External Commercial Borrowings, Trade Credits and Structured  Obligations dated March 26, 2019 (as and when updated) which requires entities raising External Commercial Borrowings  (ECB) for an average maturity of less than 5 years to hedge minimum 70% of the its ECB exposure. The Group hedges  its entire ECB and external commercial bond exposure as per Board approved hedging policy and resource mobilisation  policy. The Group manages  foreign currency risk by entering in to cross currency swaps and forward contract. When a  derivative is entered in to for the purpose of being a hedge, the Group negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match  with the terms of the hedge exposure. The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as Cross currency interest  rate swap to mitigate risk of changes in exchange rate in foreign currency and floating interest rate. The Counterparty for  these contracts is generally a bank.

Hedge effectiveness is determined  at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an  economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group enters into hedge relationships  where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item, and so a qualitative  assessment of effectiveness is performed. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the  critical terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical  derivative  method  to  assess  effectiveness.           Ineffectiveness is recognised on a cash flow hedge where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the  hedging instrument exceeds on an absolute basis the change in value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. In  such  cases,  ineffectiveness  may  arise  if:            (a)      The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item differ (i.e. nominal amounts, timing of the  forecast transaction, interest resets changes from what was originally estimated), or   (b)    Differences arise between the credit risk inherent within the hedged item and the hedging instrument. There were no ineffectiveness recognised in the statement of profit and loss. There were no other sources of ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships. 58 RISK MANAGEMENT ( Contd. ) NOTES  FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025  (Contd.) 518 Annual Report 2024-25

NOTICE 547 Shriram Finance Limited the Company cannot borrow moneys in excess of the amount  of the paid-up share capital, free reserves and securities  premium reserve, (apart from temporary loans obtained  from the Company’s bankers in the ordinary course of  business), without the approval of the Members, by way of a  special resolution. The Members of the Company by way of special resolutions  passed at the 45 th  Annual General Meeting of the Company  held on July 30, 2024 had authorised the Board of Directors  to borrow monies upto Rs. 2,35,000 crores outstanding at any  point of time for the purpose of business of the Company  and also authorised the Board to create security in favour of  the lenders, financial institutions, banks, debenture trustee in  connection with the borrowing for an amount not exceeding  Rs. 2,93,750 crores. The Company being a non-banking financial company  primarily engaged in the business of retail financing, it is  required to raise funds in the ordinary course of its business  from time to time for the purpose of on-lending to its  customers. The outstanding borrowings of the Company  as at March 31, 2025 amounted to Rs. 1,96,145.17 crores.  The Board of Directors considered that the increase in  mobilisation of funds is necessary for the Company’s growing  business. The Company’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), as on March  31, 2025 stood at 20.66 % of the aggregate risk weighted assets  on balance sheet and risk adjusted value of the off-balance  sheet items, which is well above the regulatory requirement  of minimum 15%. Considering the aforesaid budgeted projections, it is  necessary to delegate powers to the Board of Directors for  enhancing the limit of borrowings of the Company (apart  from temporary loans obtained/to be obtained by the  Company from its bankers in the ordinary course of business)  from existing Rs. 2,35,000 crores to Rs. 2,95,000 crores as per  the proposal as set out in the Item No.9 of this Notice. In connections with the secured borrowings, the Company  in the ordinary course of its business is required to creates  security by way of mortgage /charge /hypothecation of  receivables and movable or immovable properties of the  Company, both present and future, in favour of the bank(s),  financial institutions(s), debenture trustees, security trustee,  fixed deposits trustees or any other person (lenders) in such  form, manner and ranking as may be required by the lenders  including modification/perfection thereof from time to time.  This may involve disposal of whole or substantially whole of  the Company’s undertaking.  In line with the proposal for enhancement of the borrowing  powers of the Board as aforesaid, it is necessary to also  delegate powers to the Board of Directors for enhancing the  limits for the charges created/ to be created by the Company  in connection with the borrowings in favour of its lenders  from existing Rs. 2,93,750 crores to Rs. 3,54,000 crores as set  out in the Item No. 10 of this Notice.  The Board of Directors recommends passing of the  resolutions as set out in the Item Nos.9 and 10 of this Notice. None of the directors, key managerial personnel of the  Company or their relatives are concerned or interested,  financially or otherwise in the said resolutions. ITEM NO.11 Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter  referred to as the “Act”), provides that the Board of Directors of  a company shall not except with the consent of the Company  by way of Special Resolution, sell, lease or otherwise dispose  of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the undertaking of  the Company. Explanation of “undertaking” for the purpose  of Section 180(1)(a) of the Act shall mean an undertaking  in which the investment of the Company exceeds twenty  percent of its net worth as per the audited balance sheet of the  preceding financial year or an undertaking which generates  twenty percent of the total income of the Company during  the previous financial year. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company has been  raising funds by way of securitisation of receivables by way  of sale /assignment, which is cost effective. As on March 31,  2025, the outstanding Securitisation assets portfolio of the  Company was Rs. 36,728.9 crores and outstanding direct  assigned portfolio stood at Rs. 3,274.4 crores. The Members  of the Company by way of special resolution passed on July  30, 2024 in its 45 th  Annual General Meeting had authorised  the Board of Directors to securitise receivables by way of sale  / assignment from time to time provided that outstanding  amounts of such securitisation at any point of time shall not  exceed Rs. 50,000 crores. During the current Financial Year 2025-26, the Company will  continuously review its borrowing options for optimisation  of borrowing costs, maintaining good liquidity for its  business growth and timely servicing of liabilities. Therefore,  depending upon the market conditions, the Board of Directors  of the Company may require higher limits for securitisation  than the existing limit of Rs. 50,000 crore. The limit of    Rs. 75,000 crores as proposed in the Special Resolution at Item  No.11 of the Notice will give adequate flexibility to the Board  of Directors of the Company to change its borrowing profile  depending upon market conditions. With securitisation, the  Company ensures better borrowing profile, leading to lower  interest liability owing to its lending to priority sector as  per Reserve Bank of India. The securitisation of receivables  may result into disposal of undertaking as defined in the  Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) of the Act. 

548 Annual Report 2024-25 The resolution proposed at Item No.11 is to seek the  permission of the Members for enhancement of limits for  selling, assigning, securitising Receivables under Section  180(1)(a) of the Act by the Board of Directors of the Company  or its Committee as may be authorised by the Board of  Directors. The Board of Directors recommends passing of  the said resolution.
