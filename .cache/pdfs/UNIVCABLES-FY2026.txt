As per the Income Tax Act, 1961, as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, dividends paid or distributed by the Company after 1 st  April, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of the Shareholders. Your Company shall, therefore, be required to deduct tax at source at the time of making the payment of the Dividend as recommended by the Board of Directors and declared by the members in the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The members are requested to refer the governing provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and rules framed thereunder for the prescribed rates of tax deduction at source for various categories. The relevant provisions to this effect under the Income Tax Act, 1961 are succinctly given herein: (i) For Resident Shareholders, tax shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 at 10.00% on the amount of dividend, if Permanent Account Number (PAN) is provided by the Shareholders to the Company / Depository Participant. If no PAN is provided or in case of invalid PAN/PAN not linked with Aadhar/not registered their valid PAN details in their account or classified as specified person in the income-tax portal, then the tax shall be deducted at source at 20% as per Section 206AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961.  However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to a resident individual if the total dividend to be received by such resident individual shareholders of the Company during the Financial Year 2025-26 does not exceed  `  10,000/-. In cases where the shareholder provides Form 15G (applicable to any person other than a company or a firm)/Form 15H (applicable to an Individual above the age of 60 years) as notified 

4 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED under Income Tax Rules, 1962, provided that all the required eligibility conditions are met, no tax will be deducted at source. (ii) For Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) category Shareholders, tax shall be deducted at source under Section 196D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 at 20% on the amount of dividend payable. (iii) For other Non-resident Shareholders, tax is required to be deducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, at the rates in force. Accordingly, as per the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the tax shall be deducted at the rate of 20% on the amount of dividend payable to them. However, as per Section 90(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the non-resident shareholder has the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (tax treaty) between India and the country of tax residence of the concerned shareholder, if the tax treaty provisions are more beneficial. For this purpose, i.e. to avail a lower rate of deduction of tax at source under an applicable tax treaty, such non-resident shareholders will have to provide the followings: (a) Self-attested copy of the PAN allotted by the Indian Income Tax authorities; (b) Self-attested copy of Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) obtained from the tax authorities of the country of which the shareholder is resident. In case, the TRC is furnished in a language other than English, the said TRC shall have to be translated from such other language to English language and thereafter duly notarised and apostilled copy of the TRC shall have to be provided to the Registrar and Share Transfer Agents of the Company; (c) Self-declaration in Form 10F as notified under Income Tax Rules, 1962 if all the details required in this form are not mentioned in the TRC; and (d) Self-declaration by the non-resident shareholder as to: • Eligibility to claim tax treaty benefits based on the tax residential status of the shareholder, including having regard to the Principal Purpose Test (if any), introduced in the applicable tax treaty with India; • No Permanent Establishment / fixed base in India in accordance with the applicable tax treaty; •   Shareholder being the beneficial owner of the dividend income to be received on the equity shares; and • Shareholder has no reason to believe that its claim for the benefits under the tax treaty is impaired in any manner. (iv) If, at the time of deducting TDS, the status of a resident shareholder or a non-resident shareholder (having a PE in India) , as shown by the system of the Income-tax Department, is a "specified person", TDS would be deductible at twice the normally applicable rate or 5%, whichever is higher. For the above purpose, "specified person" means a person, being a resident or a non-resident having a Permanent Establishment (PE) in India- (a) Who has not furnished the return of income for the assessment year relevant to the previous year immediately preceding the financial year in which tax is required to be deducted. For this purpose, the assessment year would be reckoned to be the one for which time limit for filing Return of Income under sub-section (1) of section 139 has expired; and (b) The aggregate of TDS/TCS deducted/collected in the case of such person is Rs. 50,000 or more in the above referred previous year. Further, if owing to non-availability of PAN of a shareholder who is a "specified person" under section 206AB of the Act, the provisions of section 206AA are also applicable, TDS would be deductible at higher of the rates under section 206AA or under section 206AB of the Act. In the cases of resident shareholders, if PAN of a shareholder is not updated, it shall be assumed that the shareholder is a "specified person" for the purpose of section 206AB of the Act and TDS would be regulated accordingly. It may be noted that, the provisions of Section 206AB shall not be applicable in the cases of non-resident shareholders not having a PE in India. For this purpose, the expression PE (i.e., permanent establishment) includes a fixed place of business through which the business of the non-resident is wholly or partly carried on. Thus, if a non-resident shareholder, who is otherwise liable for higher TDS under Section 206AB, submits a duly signed and verified declaration confirming that he/she does not have a PE in India, the provisions of Section 206AB would not come into play and TDS would be deductible at the normally applicable rate. In absence of such a declaration, TDS would be as per the provisions of section 206AB of the Act. Note: All the above referred tax rates shall be duly enhanced by the applicable surcharge and cess, wherever applicable. (v) In terms of Rule 37BA of the Income Tax Rules 1962, if dividend income on which tax has been deducted at source is assessable in the hands of a person other than the deductee, then such deductee should file declaration with Company in the manner prescribed in the Rules. 

5 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED (vi) In order to enable the Company to determine the appropriate tax rate at which tax has to be deducted at source under the respective provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and rules framed thereunder, eligible shareholders are requested to provide the above-mentioned details and documents as applicable on or before 5 th  September, 2025. The dividend, if declared at the AGM, will be paid after deduction of tax at source as determined on the basis of the aforementioned documents provided by the respective shareholders as applicable to them and being found to be satisfactory. The Company is not obligated to apply the beneficial tax treaty rates at the time of deduction of tax at source on the dividend amount, which shall depend upon the completeness and satisfactory review by the Company of the documents submitted by the Non-resident Shareholders. The members holding equity shares of the Company under multiple accounts and/or different status/category and single PAN, may note that higher of tax as applicable to the status in which equity shares held under a PAN will be considered on their entire holding in different accounts.

STATE OF COMPANY’S AFFAIRS The Company is predominantly engaged in the business of manufacturing and/or sale of a wide range of Power Cables from 1.1 kV to 400 kV, Wires and Conductors, Accessories for Cables and Conductors, products for quality power solutions viz. Capacitors and Capacitor Banks, Harmonic Filters, SVGs, etc. and Turnkey Projects relating thereto. There has been no material change in the business of the Company during the financial year ended  March 31, 2025. GENERAL & CORPORATE MATTERS Your Company’s total Revenue from Operations for the fiscal year increased 19.19% over the previous year to  `  240838.62 lakhs.  The Revenue from exports for your Company stood at  `  20901.93 lakhs during the year under review, representing approximately 8.68% of the total Revenue of Operations. Earnings before interest (finance costs), tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) during the current fiscal year  `  20241.69 lakhs was up by 9.24% from the previous fiscal year  `  18529.49 lakhs and Profit before Tax (PBT) of  `  7125.19 lakhs was up by 1.69% from previous fiscal year at  `  7007.07 lakhs. Profit after Tax for the fiscal year increased 5.56% year-on-year to  `  5727.96 lakhs, compared with  `  5426.18 lakhs in the corresponding previous fiscal year. Your Company has an industry leading market share in the Extra High Voltage (EHV) Power Cable business in India which includes turnkey projects for end-to-end solution. Revenue from Operations of the EHV Power Cable business increased by approximately 20% during the year under review as compared to immediately preceding previous year as a result of augmentation of production capacity and improved efficiency by way of cost transformation initiatives. During the year under review, the Com pany executed certain significant contracts, which strengthened the Company’s goodwill and leadership in the EHV Cables and related turnkey businesses. The Company successfully commissioned the first made-in-India 400kV EHV underground cable project of 11.34 route KMs of substantial value in the state of Tamil Nadu. Another similar EHV HVAC cable project of 9.50 route KMs is under implementation and is expected to be commissioned within the first half of the ensuing year. Alongside, the Company has also established itself as reliable supplier of EHV HVAC cables in overseas market to several key projects including for supply  of 400 kV voltage grade EHV cables in Europe. Based on these experiences, overseas markets hold out a lot of promise for the Company’s EHV HVAC cables business. The Company’s state-of-the-art EHV Cables manufacturing facility with India’s first of its kind VCV (Vertical Continuous Vulcanization) technology is also equipped to manufacture EHV HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) cables. The Company is currently developing additional capabilities to expand into the EHV HVDC cables segment, anticipating fast emerging demand in the domestic market in the near future. Presently, in the Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) power cable business, your Company holds a relatively low market share compared to its peers, primarily due to limited production capacity, despite gradual capacity augmentation over the years . To address this, the Company has expanded the scope of its ongoing capacity expansion projects at the Satna (M.P.) and Verna (Goa) facilities, by increasing the total capital outlay from  `  277 Crores to over  `  505 Crores. This decision is driven by a constructive business outlook, supported by sustained and growing demand for the Company’s entire range of power cables, i.e., Low Voltage (LV), Medium Voltage (MV), High Voltage (HV)/Extra High Voltage (EHV) cables in domestic as well as international markets. 

17 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Upon successful implementation, the enhanced capacity will significantly strengthen the Company’s manufacturing capabilities. The capacity expansion project is progressing as planned and is expected to be fully operational in a phased manner by the end of the ensuing fiscal year 2025-26. The state-of-the-art Capacitors manufacturing facility of the Company alongwith MV automatic power factor control panel manufacturing and assembly set up has further enlarged its product portfolio and achieved a revenue growth of approx. 6% on a year to year basis during the year under review. The Company has also secured certain prestigious turnkey contracts of substant ial value from the state utilities for capacitor banks and allied infrastructure which are to be executed in the ensuing financial  year 2025-26. The Goa unit of the Company achieved a growth in Revenue of 16% during the financial year 2024-25 as compared to the previous financial year. Over the past few years, your Company has placed strong emphasis on delivering high-quality products at competitive prices by strategically pursuing expansion in a phased manner. This included the progressive augmentation of production capacities across Extra High Voltage (EHV), Medium Voltage (MV), and Low Voltage (LV) Power Cables, Flexible Wires, etc. while also focusing on improved capacity utilization, reduction of scrap, and optimal use of input raw materials. Strengthening the supply chain to en sure the timely availability of critical raw materials has resulted in more effective inventory control and enhanced operational eff iciency. These initiatives have been reinforced by a culture of astute financial discipline and operational excellence. The cumulative effect of these efforts has been a consistent and incremental improvement in productivity, along with the delive ry of reliable quality and cost competitiveness. These advancements have made your Company structurally robust, culturally agile, and financially resilient. Our continued focus on customer satisfaction, driven by principles of technology leadership, world-c lass quality standards, and differentiated services, has helped reinforce our brand value and distinguish the Company from its peers  in the power cable industry. Despite the ongoing global uncertainty, the outlook for the Indian power cable industry remains stable, underpinned by strong domestic demand led by government’s focus on infrastructure driven GDP growth. The multiple demand drivers including government thrust on building sustainable power transmission and distribution infrastructure, transition to renewable energy, urbanisation  and resulting growth in residential projects and commercial structure, expansion of data centres with demand for power distribution  and server operations, electrification efforts across automotive, industrial and construction sectors, increasing demand for Extra  High Voltage Cables and greater push towards domestic production in India are likely to drive faster volume growth for the cable and wire industry. The wire and cable industry saw an estimated growth of about 13% YoY basis in financial year 2024-25 as against the growth in government’s capex of around 2% YoY basis which reinforces the fact that growth rate on wires and cables is expected to remain strong in near term. Further, with ongoing geo political uncertainties around tariffs, volatile shipping rat es and commodity prices, the slight uncertainty in exports may continue. However, Indian wire and cable companies may see opportunitie s in the export market should market shares shift due to any potential tariffs. Additionally, shifting global supply-demand dynam ics present promising export opportunities. India also stands to benefit significantly from global reshoring initiatives and “China  Plus One” strategies, which are expected to create long-term structural advantages for the industry. Your Company is proactively equipping itself to capitalize on the rising demand, particularly in the high-end product category, through the phased expansion of its manufacturing facilities in alignment with emerging demand trends in domestic and international markets. The global energy system will require significant capital expenditure in the coming decades to keep up with the growing energy demand and transition to low carbon energy sources which may provide ample opportunity to the Company to increase the contribution of international business to over 10% of total revenue from operations. The members are advised to refer to the separate section on Management Discussion and Analysis for a detailed understanding of the operating results and business performance. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the year under review, as stipulated under the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, (“Listing Regulations”), is provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis Report, which forms a part of the Annual Report. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE During the year under review, the Company continued its focus on judicious capital allocation and incurred capital expenditure aggregating  `  12613.20  lakhs, consisting of additions to (a) Plant & Equipment of  `  8946.89 lakhs; (b) Other Fixed Assets of `  126.26  lakhs; (c) Intangible Assets of  `  35.50  lakhs; (d) Capital Work-in-Progress of  `  3448.35  lakhs and (e) Intangible Assets Under Development of  `  56.20  lakhs primarily directed towards capacity expansion initiatives aimed at supporting future growth. The Company’s entire growth plan is based on organic expansion and it sees enough growth opportunities within its existing facilities to implement expansion plans for scaling up the manufacturing capacity of LV, MV, HV & EHV Power Cables, Insulated Wires, Capacitors, etc.

39 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Management Discussion and Analysis INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS The efficient transmission and distribution of electricity are central to a reliable and modern power infrastructure. Power cab les play a vital role in this ecosystem, enabling the bulk transfer of electricity from generating stations to substations, and sub sequently for distribution to end consumers. Extra High Voltage (EHV) and High Voltage (HV) cables are primarily deployed in power generation stations, sub-transmission networks, large switchyards, and major industrial, commercial, and residential developments. EHV XLPE cables offer a viable alternative for underground transmission, particularly in urban areas where overhead lines are constrained by space limitations  or environmental concerns. While EHV XLPE cables have technical limitations regarding length, they can offer enhanced reliability and reduced maintenance compared to overhead lines. Medium Voltage (MV) cables are predominantly used in power distribution networks, serving as critical links that connect generation with end-use applications. Both MV and HV cables are indispensable  to the power sector, acting as key enablers of operational efficiency and the shift toward sustainable energy solutions. Low Volta ge (LV) cables, in addition to their role in distribution, cater to a wide array of applications across various industries and res idential sectors. The Indian power cable market continues to witness steady growth, underpinned by supportive government policies, regulatory reforms, and national development programs. This momentum is further propelled by rising electricity demand due to rapid industrialization, modernization of the grid, rural and railway electrification, metro rail expansions, increased renewable ene rgy investments, renewed focus on oil and gas, continued thrust on physical digital infrastructure including data centres and the r evival of construction activity. Upgradation and augmentation of existing electrical infrastructure to integrate renewable capacity ad ditions are also contributing significantly to market expansion. Furthermore, the government’s push towards domestic manufacturing through  Make in India  and  Atmanirbhar Bharat  initiatives has strengthened the push toward reducing imports and boosting indigenous production. As per recent report of Goldman Sachs, significant investment opportunities are foreseen in India’s power sector, particularly in transmission and distribution infrastructure. India needs substantial investment to expand its power transmissi on network to accommodate the projected increase in power demand and the integration of renewable energy sources. The report underscores the importance of strengthening transmission and distribution networks to minimise losses and ensure reliable power supply. The Report projects that India will require over US$ 550 Billion in power transmission and distribution capex by Financ ial Year 2050, contributing a major portion of the overall energy transition investment. As per the available market reports, the global cable and wire market size is estimated to be US$ 220 Billion and India account s for less than 5% as of fiscal year 2024. However, India has started gaining market share in global cable and wire market, which tre nd is expected to continue. Further, it is expected that revenue growth for power cables may outperform other sub-categories withi n wires and cables industry until FY 2034, with revenue for power cables estimated to rise at a CAGR of 14-15% versus light duty cables which is expected to grow around at a CAGR of 12-13%. Cables generally have more diverse use cases and more diverse customer base than wires. Capex in power transmission, distribution, the infrastructure segments such as data centres, EV and the renewable transition are likely to fuel demand for cables in foreseeable future. The global energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, often referred to as the Energy Transition & Power Technologies industry. The key product lines in the critical energy transition equipments and power technologies industry, inte ralia, include high voltage electrical equipment and solutions such as capacitor banks, harmonic filters, reactive power compensation systems, thyristor-controlled series capacitors and grid interconnection solution feature technologies such as static var compe nsator systems (SVC) which are catered by Capacitor Division of your Company. The energy transition equipment and quality power solution products market of, interalia, capacitors and capacitor banks, harmo nic filters and SVGs, etc. poised for significant growth in the coming decades. As governments and businesses around the world intensify their efforts to decarbonize the energy sector, the market for energy transition equipment will continue to expand, d riven by technological advancements, supportive policies and increasing public awareness of the need for climate action. Emerging markets such as India and Southeast Asia are expected to be major growth areas for energy transition equipment, as these regions are rapidly scaling up their renewable energy capacity and investing in grid modernisation. A capacity bank, also known  as a capacitor bank, is a collection of capacitors connected in parallel in critical energy transition system. The primary purpose  of capacity bank is to provide reactive power compensation to improve power factor and voltage regulation in electrical networks.  As industries become more reliant on stable and high-quality power supply, there is a growing demand for solutions that can improv e power factor, voltage stability and grid reliability. Harmonic filters are designed to reduce harmonic distortion in electrical  systems caused by nonlinear loads such as power electronic devices, variable frequency drives (VFDs), rectifiers and other equipment. A Static Var Compensator (SVG) is a device used in critical energy transition equipment systems to regulate voltage, improve powe r factor and enhance system stability by controlling reactive power flow. SVGs are deployed in power systems to compensate for reactive power fluctuations caused by varying loads, particularly those with a high percentage of inductive loads like motors a nd transformers. 

40 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Looking ahead, the Company anticipates sustainable growth, driven by robust demand and strategic capacity enhancements in power cables, wires and quality power solution products dealt with by the Company. This includes supply and turnkey projects from its EHV underground cables and quality power solution products from its facility at Satna (Madhya Pradesh). Additionally, ongoing and planned capacity augmentation at the Satna and Goa facilities of the Company for MV cables, LV cables, insulated winding wires, building wires, and multicore flexible cables are expected to further bolster growth, building upon gradual enhancements made over previous years. Other product lines including specialty cables, rubber and elastomer cables, various wire and cable types, conductors, and qual ity power solutions viz. Capacitor and Capacitor Banks, Harmonic Filters, SVGs, etc. have performed well in line with prevailing market trends and available capacities. The Company’s flagship brand “UNISTAR”, a symbol of quality and safety, continues to enjoy strong brand equity. The enduring presence of the “UNISTAR” brand alongside the M.P. Birla Group logo reinforces the Company’s long-standing commitment to excellence and its legacy of trust, transparency and technology. Economic Outlook India is expected to be the fastest growing major economy in the world with projected GDP growth rate between 6.30% and 6.80% for fiscal year 2025-26. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has specifically projected a real GDP growth of 6.50% for the financia l year 2025-26 citing an evenly balanced outlook despite global uncertainties. As per recent review by the Economic Affairs Depar tment, Government of India, with no major imbalances in the macro aggregates, a subdued inflation rate combined with a growth supporti ve monetary policy stance, India’s macroeconomic health is in a relative Goldilocks situation. However, as per RBI growing trade disruptions and intensifying geopolitical hostilities could negatively impact the domestic growth outlook. Moreover, a decelera tion in global growth will act as a drag on domestic output. Notwithstanding the said contingency, in the prevailing global milieu,  the Indian economy remains a key driver of global growth. Sectoral Review Infrastructure and energy are two crucial enablers of economic progress and India is focusing strongly on them in successive un ion budgets because infrastructure and energy are not only closely linked but also to an extent, are dependent on each other. In th e Union Budget for the financial year 2025–26, the government has earmarked  `  11.21 trillion for capital expenditure, marking a 10.1% increase over the revised estimate of  `  10.18 trillion for 2024–25. This allocation constitutes approximately 3.1% of the GDP and underscores the government’s continued emphasis on infrastructure development, which may continue to hold the sector in good stead. India has been focusing on energy transition and energy security and the government has been working towards enhancing the country’s energy ecosystem with a plan for near doubling of the capacity in the entire electricity value chain by  2030 with public and private investments. The power demand in India has witnessed strong growth in the economy and improving industrial activity. However, the supply side has not ramped up materially due to under investments in the sector, leading to p ower shortages in pockets across the country. As a result, the power sector has entered into a capex cycle across generation, transm ission and distribution space to ensure adequate supply of power to support the growing economy. India’s wires and cables industry constitutes 39% of the electrical industry and forms a crucial part in the construction and i nfrastructure activities of the government and private players. According to an estimate, the cable and wire industry is expected to grow 2x  that of GDP growth during financial year 2024-2030, driven by capacity expansion, buoyant domestic demand led by capex cycle in power transmission and distribution, real estate and demand from emerging segments viz. data centres, EV and mobility upgrades, railways and metro railway expansion, etc. On top of this, penetration into export markets, emphasizes the room for growth. It  is expected that volume growth in cables will be led by government’s focus on sustainable infrastructure driven GDP growth, demand from emerging segment viz. data centres, EV and mobility upgrades and increased acceptance of made in India products in overseas market places. The demand outlook for wires and cables therefore looks to be robust due to substantial investments lined up in India in infrastructure, renewables, railways & metro railways, industrial capex and data centers in the next 7-10  years’ time-frame. Power is amongst the most critical components of infrastructure, crucial for economic growth and welfare of the nation. Therefo re, the existence and development of adequate power infrastructure is essential for sustained growth of the Indian economy. The demand for energy is rising across India and this expansion will need commensurate investments in energy transmission, distribu tion infrastructure in alignment with accelerated pace of energy transition. India’s power sector is one of the most diversified in  the world. Sources of power generation range from conventional such as coal, lignite, natural gas, oil, hydro and nuclear power to viable non-conventional/renewables such as wind, solar and agriculture and domestic waste. To meet the rapidly increasing demand for electricity in the country, massive addition to the installed generating capacity is required and in further chain a  robust and modern transmission, sub-transmission and distribution infrastructure needs to be created for evacuation and smooth distrib ution of electricity to the end users. In the power sector, while the over dependence on government support and subsidies has been recognised and steps are being taken, more is required to make the sector self-sustaining thereby providing an opportunity to develop an India-focused model with a greater emphasis on sustainable development. 

41 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED However, the country faces a daunting challenge to reform and modernise the distribution sector, which still lacks sufficient competition in most parts of the country. Distribution holds the key to capacity build-up across the electricity value chain. T he Government of India has had some success in nudging states to bring down indebtedness of their distribution monopolies but not on scale to inspire investing confidence by private capital. Historically, the emphasis has been more towards power generation capacity vis-à-vis transmission and distribution. The focus, however, needs to gradually shift towards transmission and distrib ution networks, including provision for smart metering, installing sub-stations for renewable energy to feed into the grid. As such g oing ahead, India will need higher investment in transmission and distribution grid infrastructure, grid automation, distributed gri ds, storage systems, etc. in respect of all of which technologies exist today but need sharper focus which will eventually lead to  higher demand in growth for power cable industry. The transformation of National Grid India into Smart National Grid India shall requi re an upgrade and addition to the current power transmission and distribution infrastructure. India has articulated its clear comm itment to reach net-zero emission by 2070 and meet 50% of its electricity requirements from renewable energy (RE) sources by 2030. The initiatives underway to ramp up RE capacity are promising and to bring them to fruition. The country’s efforts to ramp up g rid infrastructure, storage capacity and formulate tailor-made energy policies for states will accelerate energy transition to a cl ean, affordable and accessible energy future. A transmission plan for integration of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 is also being implemented in a phased manner commensurate with capacity addition. Looking back at fiscal year 2024-25, one of the key highlights of India’s power sector was the growing power demand propelled b y economic growth and improved industrial activities. As per National Electricity Plan, 2023, this trend is expected to continue  in the coming period with peak power demand expected to reach 277 GW in fiscal year 2025-26. This is despite the fact that India still  has very low per capital energy usage of approx.1395 Kilowatt hours in fiscal year 2023-24 which is approximately one-third of glob al average. As the fifth largest economy and most populous country globally, India is poised for sustained high economic growth, driven by its Viksit Bharat aspirations. Consequently, the country’s energy consumption is expected to rise substantially drive n by factors like industrialization and urbanization, ambitious renewable energy initiatives and strategic grid integration with two  third of incremental supply coming from renewable sources. The country is witnessing swift change in its energy consumption and energy sources simultaneously in a disruptive fashion. India’s energy needs are still growing and therefore legacy capacity using foss il fuels will not be retired even if the country transitions to a higher share of energy generation from renewable sources. The po wer sector is at the heart of India’s decarbonization strategy as it is one of the largest emitters. The government has launched se veral initiatives to transition to a low-carbon, sustainable energy future to balance rising energy demand with climate commitments.  The Government of India’s mission Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) launched at COP26, embodies this commitment. By integrating its economic growth aspirations with LiFE mission, India aims to increase its per capital energy and electricity consumption in a sustainable manner, ensuring a harmonious balance between economic development and environmental stewardship. Also, by promoting RE generation, enhancing grid infrastructure and improving distribution efficiency, the government aims to not only reduce emissions but also strengthen energy security and boost economic growth. These initiatives are crucial for achieving India’s ambitious targets, including 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2070. The government has set an ambitious target to increase RE capacity by fiscal 2032. According to the National Electricity Plan 2023, issued by  the CEA, capacity of 393 GW (311 GW of solar and 82 GW of wind) is planned to be commissioned between fiscals 2023 and 2032, thereby increasing the total RE capacity to ~500 GW by fiscal 2032. The plan also envisages energy storage capacity of 75 GW/ 411 GWh by fiscal 2032. In order to improve the energy distribution infrastructure of public utilities the government launched  the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) in July, 2021 with an outlay of  `  3.03 lakh crores, which emphasizes demand-side management to improve power distribution efficiency and decarbonize the sector. By targeting 12-15% aggregate technical and commercial losses and installing 25 crores smart meters, the RDSS enables consumers to optimize energy use, reduce peak demand and reliance on fossil fuel. Enhanced grid infrastructure supports renewable energy integration and distributed energy resources such as roof top solar. Through demand side management, RDSS minimizes wastage, cut emission and accelerates India’s transition to low carbon energy future, aligning with the country’s net zero target by 2070. As such there are exciting  times ahead for the power sector as it endeavours to meet growing demand while also meeting its renewable energy goals. There is visible growth opportunities in Power Cables and quality power solution products industry on the back of a combination of sever al macro factors and strategic initiatives undertaken by the Government. The Government’s initiatives such as Power for All, RDSS, etc. should help demand growth for power cables. In addition, India’s capex cycle has witnessed meaningful upswing in recent years with both public and private capex showing positive momentum. In addition to domestic demand, the global market is also witnessing material growth with sectors like renewables and energy transmission and distribution infrastructure driving the pac e. The fast rising in demand for electricity in India, particularly in non-metro cities including smart cities is driving the grow th for Extra High Voltage Cables. Further, the rapid digital transformation, development of data centers and cloud computing may also propel the demand for power cables in the coming years. Underground Cables (UG) are generally used in densely populated areas such as cities and metros, where there is a high density of automobiles, high-rise commercial & residential buildings and places with vital installations of uninterrupted power supply  (such as water supply system, hospitals, IT services, etc.). UG cables help in ensuring uninterrupted power supply, which is uncommon in the overhead (OH) system. Though transmission and distribution losses have reduced over the years India’s power transmission and distribution loss of ~16% is still one of the highest in the world. This issue can be addressed via underground cabling. He nce, increasing urbanisation may see rising adoption of underground cables in metros and cities in the near future. 

42 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED In all the states of the country, the underground sub-transmission power transmission network is inevitably being constructed,  due to right-of-way constraints in overhead transmission networks, ecological, environmental, safety and aesthetics issues, using H igh Voltage/Extra High Voltage underground power cable system. In addition, the rising cost of real estate is economically favourin g underground power transmission as opposed to overhead power transmission lines which occupies expensive corridor of land. Under the given scenario, the demand for EHV power cables has a large potential for growth in the coming years. The domestic cables and wires market has steadily moved to an organised play from a largely unorganised play, including regional/national players. The shift was led by rising awareness among consumers towards safety and quality, the advent of GST regime, technologi cal innovation, brand building and technical and regulatory compliances. All these suggest sustainable growth opportunities for products and services of your Company being an established supplier of power cables upto the voltage grade of 400 kV and also of Quality Power Solutions equipment viz. Capacitors and Capacitors Banks, Harmonic Filters & SVGs, etc. for optimize energy saving and conservation. Industry Specific Raw Material Erraticity The cable industry continues to navigate a highly volatile raw material landscape, marked by sharp and unpredictable fluctuatio ns in the prices of metals and polymers. These trends have posed significant challenges in cost management, strategic planning, an d customer pricing strategies. Copper and aluminium prices remained particularly volatile during the financial year 2024–25, with expectations of further increases in FY 2025–26 due to growing global protectionism, supply chain disruptions and the recalibra tion of international alliances. A significant portion of raw materials, both domestic and imported, are priced in foreign currencie s. Consequently, fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly of the Indian rupee against the US dollar and euro, have further compounded cost pressures. This currency volatility has emerged as a major vulnerability for the Indian wire and cable industry , particularly when combined with unpredictable commodity markets. While many customers have aligned with industry requests to include raw material price variation clauses in contracts, a substa ntial portion of the customer base continues to operate under firm price agreements. In response, the industry has proactively engage d with such customers to advocate for the adoption of Price Variation (PV) clauses as a standard procurement practice. The indust ry remains optimistic about expanding the share of contracts that incorporate PV mechanisms, which are critical for mitigating pri cing risk and ensuring long-term sustainability. Despite these challenges, the availability of metals and polymers has remained relatively stable. Furthermore, the entry of ove rseas suppliers establishing sales operations in India has improved the quality and accessibility of raw materials for domestic manuf acturers. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, and rising global inflation, the future trajectory of international c ommodity prices remains difficult to predict. The industry is closely monitoring these developments and continues to adapt its procureme nt and pricing strategies to remain resilient and competitive in an evolving market environment. Game Changing Policies to Spur Growth The state of play of Nations in the international business is tending to lean on protectionism in trade policies. The Governmen t of India has also taken several steps for the benefit of the Indian industries to foster a strong, sustainable and inclusive growt h. Recognising the importance of improving and building new roads, railways, ports, airports, telecommunications, energy infrastru cture, etc., the Government of India has increased its budgetary allocations to underpin creation of infrastructure, while simultaneou sly undertaking measures to raise and attract private capital and administrative reforms to make the process for planning and execu ting infrastructure investments more efficient. The key government initiatives aimed towards better planning and execution have been the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) and Gati Shakti. NIP provides a comprehens ive list of projects that would need to be implemented for India to upgrade its infrastructure in all areas i.e. transportation, en ergy, communications and social infrastructure. Goals of the NIP were to ensure seamless connectivity, prioritisation of resources an d timely creation of capacities. The NIP was supplemented by a national infrastructure master plan which was announced under the title ‘Gati Shakti’ covering a period of 25 years with a focus on roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways a nd logistics. Gati Shakti envisages building a digital platform that will bring 16 ministries together for integrated planning and  coordinated implementation of infrastructure connectivity projects. The aim of the new National Logistics Policy is to reduce the cost of l ogistics from 14-18% of GDP to global best practices of 8% by 2030. To augment “Make in India, Make for India and Make for the World”, the Government has initiated another flagship Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme which would upgrade and modernise technology, augment manufacturing capacities and would also attract foreign investments. The Government of India has selected several sectors up till now as beneficiaries of PLI and  more sectors are under consideration. Though the cable industry as of now does not fall under the scheme, it would stand to indirect ly benefit from the industries entitled to the scheme by way of higher demand from new capital investments for scaling-up the capacities. At the intersection of a risking economy, transition targets and climatic change, lies India’s power sector with a ravenous app etite with an opportunity to strengthen its new energy sources, India’s power sector is at the forefront of Government’s focus. While weighing on energy security, net zero deadline and export ambitions, the country aims for 500GW of renewable energy by the year 

43 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED 2030, 85GW of additional thermal capacity by FY 2032 and nuclear capacity of 21 GW by 2032. To achieve the target of 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity, the government has adopted multifaceted strategy. Apart from rapid RE capacity addition, streamlining  the supply chain, bringing in hybrid and storage solutions and strengthening the domestic production of key inputs. However, the sector’s transformation hinges on the key interventions i.e. rapid deployment of storage solutions including proposed hydro, modernization of grid infrastructure with emphasis on dynamic load management and market-based mechanism for better resource allocation. The key challenges therefore remain to be transmission system extension and strengthening, availability of adequate capacity for sharply rising peak power demand, land acquisition and rights of the way clearances, transmission supply chain, gr id stability, etc. India’s data centre demand for power according to initial projections, is likely to go upto 3.20 GW by FY 2028  as against current data centre capacity of approx. 1 GW. This growth is being driven by government incentives, infrastructure inve stments and a using demand for digital services. Further, till the data centres are developed transmission lines and other infrastructu re needs to be readied to cater to the demand timely. India’s peak demand for power which has been rising at a compounded Annual Growth Rate of 6% is now expected to grow faster at 7% in the next five years, owing to increased economic activities, digitalisation and rapid industrialization and rising tre nd of extended heat waves. The Central Electricity Authority has projected the Country’s peak power demand to touch 270 GW in the financial year 2025-26 and reach 446 GW by 2030. Renewable Energy in India currently accounts for approx.44% of total installed capacity but contributes only 23% to energy generation, with the majority of energy still coming from thermal sources. Although , India us on track to achieve its target of 50% installed capacity renewables well before 2030, the share of renewable energy in overall energy mix demands much closer attention. Further, the scale and speed of energy diversification, coupled with capacity expansion and the enhancement of transmission networks will be pivotal in ensuring that India’s power sector can sustainably meet electricity demand. The Government is expecting investment of approximately 9.15 lakh crores in central and state transmis sion systems by 2032 as per revised National Electricity Plan, which may help meet the increasing electricity demand, facilitate ren ewable energy integration and green hydrogen load into the grid. Accordingly, power transmission and distribution sector is set for si gnificant growth, driven by increasing electricity demand and focused renewable energy goals. On the distribution side, the government is focusing on the health of state electricity discoms. The RDSS Scheme launched with an outlay of  `  3.03 lakh crores is the biggest driver of capex on the distribution front. The power sector comprising of Generation, Transmission and Distribution is the key demand driver for electrical cables. Within these sectors, the financial health of distribution companies (Discoms) continues to be a pressing point despite gradual improv ement in AT&C losses. The inept state-owned Discoms continued to impede the efficient functioning of the Generation and Transmission sectors. The Central Government has extended financial packages to bail-out the beleaguered Discoms from their massive accumulated losses and debt burden several times in last two decades including through the financial restructuring plan in 2013 , Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana I in 2017 and II in 2020. In addition to the liquidity infusion, policy changes and reforms are b eing implemented for sustained operational efficiency. It is expected that ongoing RDSS will be helpful in financing continued refor ms focused on Discoms sustainability and may benefit consumers and industry alike. In addition, a greater push towards Renewable Energy and creating transmission evacuation infrastructure for renewable energy generating plants by developing green energy corridors, accelerated bidding trajectory for renewable energy thereby providing visibility on future capacity addition, liquidity infusion scheme(s) for capex to state governments and sector reforms in power transmission and distribution sector are some of the initiatives which may fuel demand for power cables in foreseeable future. Further, Union Budget 2025 has allocated  `  48396 Crores to the power sector towards energy security and grid modernization which includes  `  16021 Crores investment in revamped distribution sector scheme (RDSS) to enhance efficiency and financial health of discoms. Plans have also been laid out to incentivize electricity distribution reforms and enhance intra-state transm ission capacity by states. States will be allowed to engage in additional borrowing of 0.50 percent of GSDP, contingent on these refor ms. Further, in terms of economic investment, there is a focus on public-private partnership in infrastructure, with a proposed out lay of `  1.50 trillion for 50 year interest free loans to states for capital expenditure. As a part of Nuclear Energy Mission for Viksi t Bharat development of atleast 100GW of nuclear energy by 2047 is considered to be essential for energy transition efforts. The Budget also laid focus on export led growth and integration into global supply chains which is a clear signal of India’s ambition to b ecome global manufacturing hub aligning with the vision of transforming “Make in India” into “Make for India” and “Make for the World ”. By prioritizing domestic manufacturing, energy storage nuclear energy, skilling and R&D, the government has set the stage for a ne w chapter in India’s evolution of not only meeting country’s energy needs but also lead the world in clean energy innovation. In Search of Realistic Optimism India presents a compelling mix of macro-economic stability, diverse sectoral opportunities and a concurrent rise in consumer a nd infrastructure spending and corporate investment.

The Company gives priority to the customers who have sound financial locus standi. The Company closely monitors the working capital requirements by constant follow up on receivables and maintaining lean and symmetr ic inventories. Liquidated Damage Risk The Customers have become more demanding in terms of price and delivery period. Owing to intense competition, short delivery contracts have to be accepted by the Company. In case of failure to meet the delivery period, the Company is at a risk of being imposed with liquidated damage. The Company is constantly mitigating its internal constraints to improve the efficiencies in an integrated manner in all the functional areas including execution of turnkey/works contracts to reduce the possibilities of suc h risk. Operational Risk Operational risks related to people, processes, systems and external factors have a potential risk on the Company’s performance . To reduce such risk, the Company has a risk-review policy in all areas of operations. Project Risk The Company is executing large turnkey projects. To implement such projects, statutory obligations from various authorities rel ating to right-of-way permissions are necessary. As these statutory obligations are neither in the control of the user nor within the co ntrol of the Company, this is a potential risk which may cause deferment of the projects resulting to blockage of receivables and cost over- run. The Company constantly keeps the customer informed on such delays involving statutory requirements in order to avoid the imposition  of liquidated damages. The Company meticulously monitors the projects with constant coordination between the execution team at the respective sites with review at regular intervals. Prior to targeting project contracts, the Company carefully weighs the feasi bility of timely implementing the projects. Technology Risk Your Company is agile on the technology frontier by constantly reviewing new technology in terms of product and process to avoi d obsolescence. The Company has a background of constantly upgrading the technology to maintain its position at par with internat ional players and remain ahead of its peers in the home-turf. Growth Stagnation Risk The Company has a profitable growth plan and avoids the risk of “growth-trap”. The Company believes in a “good growth plan” for sustainability rather than being over-zealous to get bigger and brasher for risky acquisition for attaining a higher market sha re on a low margin strategy. The strategy of your Company is to optimise its resources on high-end-high-margin products as opposed to high- volume-low-margin products. Hence, the top-line growth is compensated with a better bottom-line ensuring better returns on capi tal employed. Product Development Risk Your Company has embraced the principle of the constant need for product innovation as per evolving industry standards. The new ly developed products are validated by type testing and long-term accelerated ageing test from a recognised independent testing la boratory, if required. As these tests have significant cost involvement, any failure in the product development results to financial and  opportunity loss. The recognised Research & Development Lab and in-house testing laboratories of the Company have NABL Accreditation and is equipped with comprehensive testing facilities which can verify and assess the quality of the product during the process and fi nal stage prior to conducting the certification tests at an independent laboratory. Brand Attrition Risk New brands of various players have entered into the market segments which are popularised through advertising media and may gradually eclipse the Company’s brand. The hallmark of the Company’s success in retaining the sheen of its brand is by way of m aintaining a top-quality image. The Company’s brand image is synonymous to the best-of-class in quality. The Company issues periodical advertisements in some of the prestigious technical journals, participates in seminars & industrial exhibitions, publish techni cal papers to 

49 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED retain the brand image and invites customers and consultants for exposition of its manufacturing facilities. These activities a re aimed at brand building and promotional strategies. EXTERNAL RISKS: Artificial and non-explicit trade barriers in certain export markets The global power cables trade is being increasingly exposed to trade policies and tariffs aimed to support and protect local manufacturing.  The ongoing geopolitical events and economic shifts by way of growing global protectionism, supply chain disrup tion and the recalibration of international alliances and the rise of economic nationalism have also created fluid situation forcing  to reassess dependencies and adapt to new dynamics.  As a consequence, escalating costs of raw materials and logistical operations , supply chain bottlenecks caused by geo-political developments, regional conflicts and social unrest may impact business operati ons. Further the implementation of sustainable practices in manufacturing and operations adhering to stringent environment and safet y regulations can be costly and complex in nature for compliance as limited availability of sustainable materials and standardisa tion challenges hinder the industry’s efforts to adopt environment friendly practices.  In addition, training of workforce on the ch anging market landscapes and regulatory regime, market issues such as delivery delays, geopolitical tensions, and natural disasters ca n disrupt the supply chain requiring efforts for securing and diversifying a robust supply chain management system to handle pric e volatility and ensure a steady supply of raw materials. Market Demand Risk Historically, the demand of power cables has been cyclical in pattern. Your Company is dependent on the infrastructural sector, industries and original equipment manufacturers. The Government policies have a direct bearing on the demand from the various market segments. Your Company has a broad base clientele, wide product range and flexible manufacturing set-up, therefore, it can somewhat off-set the cyclical or depressed demand of affected segment with the other segments. From time-to-time, the Company makes changes in its product- mix to suit the order and demand pattern. Customer Risk Your Company is prone to risk of customer’s priority shift, increasing customer power and over-reliance on major customers. To mitigate these risks, your Company maintains constant touch with its clientele to understand and deliver products and services aligned to its changing priorities. Your Company maintains strong business relationship with large customers by providing techn ical guidance and information, support on urgent and crisis requirements to remain virtually indispensable to the client. Your Compa ny has built a reputation as a preferred supplier with most of its customers by creating a quality trust in a bid to protect itsel f from competition and entry of new players. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors gained global relevance as key indicators for long term value creations requiring organisations to demonstrate integration of sustainable development practices in their operations. The Company has initiated appropriate measures for ESG implementation with internal and external stakeholders engagement in line with establish ed global practices. Competition Risk The nature of competitive risk is distinct for each product group. In the EHV segment, the competition is from both, the Indian  and the overseas manufacturers. The risk involves entry barriers which are gradually being made more stringent by the customers to screen out several players. It is imperative for the Company to acquire performance record credentials from the user on supply  and installation to qualify as an eligible bidder. It is also necessary to repeat test and revalidate test reports for specific typ e & design of the product. The Company has to keep at par with the development and innovation introduced by the multinational companies to avoid the risk of obsolescence. In the HV & MV segment, new entrants pose a risk on the price competitiveness. The LV segment is intensely competitive with the proliferation of regional producers of low-quality-low-margin products which has been pernicious to health of the organised sector. The Company is addressing to the quality conscious customers to retain its market share. Raw Material Price Risk The prices of international commodities e.g., copper, aluminium, lead and polymers, which are the key raw material components, are subject to considerable price volatility. Further, strict implementations of quality control orders without adequate and co mpetitive local production facilities matching with global quality standards for key inputs also poses risk of price volatility and leads  to unjustified price increases. Commodities such as Aluminium and copper have use cases for higher applications in energy transiti on products. As a result, green inflation risks remain high. Since the market prices of cables are generally on firm price basis,  the seesawing prices of these commodities can severely impact the cost of the product where the consequential risk must be borne by the Company. The Company gives priority to customers who allow price variation on input raw materials. In  case of firm  price contracts with protracted deliveries, the Company is actively pursuing back-to-back hedging that involves identifying the expos ure timely and hedging it with vendor(s) at fixed price or by taking a future position at London Metal Exchange (LME) promptly to a void such risk. Occasional scarcity of polymers in the global market is a risk in terms of meeting customer’s delivery commitments.  Over 

50 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED and above, these polymer prices are sensitive to the crude oil prices where the volatility has been unprecedented. The Company  is ameliorating such risk by procuring the materials in tranches to even-out price fluctuations. However, the relentless inflation  trend in commodities which has been and will be a pain-point in the near future as well. Other External Economic Risks Prevailing financial and liquidity conditions within the broader economy, including governmental budgetary allocations for key clients, and the Company's capacity to sustain market share amid intensifying competitive pressures. Unfavourable macro-economi c environment, such as fluctuating interest rates, inflation and systemic financial crises scenario, could lead to a global slow  down in growth, market recessions and may affect economic stability. The interconnected nature of business processes in the digital environment is increasing the risks of cyber threats and data breach by inimical third parties, potentially disrupting Company’ s business operations causing financial losses or reputational damage. The Company, however, ensures safe handling of the Company’s sensitive data as well as that of its Associates by implementing various controls. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS The Company has an adequate system of internal control in place, which assures of:  Authorisation, recording, analyzing and reporting of transactions.  Recording and adequate safeguarding of assets.  Upkeep of accounting records and trustworthiness of financial information. Key elements are:  Clear and well-defined organisation structure and limits of financial authority and well laid out standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each functional authority and department;  Corporate policies for financial reporting, accounting, information security, investment appraisal and corporate governance;  Annual Operating Business Plan (AOP) including identifying key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities & threats;  External firm of Chartered Accountants to carry out internal audit of all functions including physical verification of inventor ies;  Risk Management Committee and Audit Committee of the Board which monitors and reviews all risks and control issues and financial matters;  Computerized and integrated financial and accounting functions, information feedback system of process parameters and back tracing from finished products to raw material stage;  The Company has implemented SAP S/4HANA 2022, an advanced version of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, to achieve improved data management, seamless integration of functional departments, and enhanced internal control mechanisms.  Routine evaluation of all financial operating and information technology system; and  Laying down risk assessment and minimisation procedures and regular review of the same.

57 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED NA S. Material Indicate Rationale for identifying the In case of risk, approach Financial implications of the risk No. issue whether risk or risk / opportunity to adapt or mitigate or opportunity identified opportunity (R/O) 1. Occupational R Health & Safety 2 Environmental R Footprint of operations 3 Energy O Management Occupational Health & Safety is categorized as a risk due to the high rates of injuries and fatalities which are higher than in many other industries. Temporary workers face greater vulnerability due to limited training and experience. Inadequate management of these risks can lead to serious human harm, legal consequences, and significant financial burdens. Although the Company's operational footprint is relatively limited, it still presents environmental risks that may affect local ecosystems and nearby communities. These include potential impacts on biodiversity, air emissions, water discharge, natural resource depletion, and waste generation. Effectively managing these risks is essential to prevent legal challenges and protect the Company's reputation. The Company views energy management as a strategic opportunity due to the advantages it offers in improving energy efficiency, broadening the energy mix, and incorporating renewable and alternative energy sources. By adopting energy-efficient technologies and systems, the Company can lower operational costs, boost productivity, and reduce exposure to energy price volatility. The commissioning of a rooftop solar power plant further reflects the Company's dedication to clean energy, helping to lessen reliance on traditional sources while supporting broader sustainability objectives. Leveraging energy management in this way not only enhances the Company's competitiveness but also reinforces its commitment to environmental responsibility and a more sustainable future. The organization places a high priority on employee health and safety by: implementing comprehensive safety procedures; conducting risk assessments, guaranteeing adherence to occupational health and safety laws; offering frequent training courses and cultivating a robust safety culture; and consistently observing and enhancing safety procedures. The Company is actively mitigating the risk associated with footprints of operations by: • Implementing robust environmental management systems; • Conducting regular assessments; and • Adopting sustainable practices through responsible resource consumption, waste reduction initiatives, and stakeholder engagement. Negative: Accidents increase insurance, litigation, and downtime costs. Negative: Non-compliance penalties. Positive: By enhancing overall energy efficiency, the Company can reduce energy consumption and associated costs, leading to potential cost savings and improved profitability. Diversifying energy sources and accessing alternative and renewable energy can also contribute to long-term financial sustainability by mitigating the risks of energy price fluctuations and reducing reliance on conventional energy sources. Additionally, investing in renewable energy initiatives, such as the rooftop solar power plant, may provide opportunities for incentives, subsidies, and long term cost savings through reduced energy bills. Overall, effective energy management can positively impact the Company's financial performance and enhance its competitive position in the market.

Employee O Growth, Training, and Learning & Development 5. Product R Responsibility 6. Community O Development and Relations 7. Water R Management O With evolving regulatory standards, new technologies, and increasing client expectations in both Cables and Capacitors cable manufacturing, continuous employee upskilling is necessary to maintain competitiveness and quality. Lack of training can lead to operational inefficiencies, safety issues, and reduced innovation. As a manufacturer and EPC provider, the company's products directly impact client operations, safety, and environmental performance. Growing demand for sustainable, compliant, and high-quality products makes this a competitive advantage. Conversely, this also presents a meaningful opportunity for the Company to build trust and long-term value by actively engaging with local stakeholders, addressing their needs, and embedding community priorities into project planning. Doing so can help secure a social license to operate, enhance the Company's brand image, and support long- term sustainability by fostering inclusive development and minimizing conflict. Manufacturing and EPC operations may lead to high water consumption and wastewater discharge. Regulatory pressure and risks of water scarcity in project locations make it a key area of concern and improvement. Water management presents a significant opportunity for the cable industry by enabling more efficient and sustainable manufacturing processes, reducing operational costs, and enhancing the industry's environmental profile. By adopting water-saving technologies and practices, cable manufacturers can minimize water consumption, reduce wastewater discharge, and potentially lower energy costs associated with water treatment.

To embed sustainability into core operations and comply with BRSR guidelines, the Company plans to implement measurable, time-bound commitments across environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. Principle 1: Establish a comprehensive sustainability database:  A centralised data system will capture energy, emissions, water and social indicators. Having robust metrics and targets is an essential component of ESG reporting. The database will enable quarterly ESG reviews and support accurate disclosures. Ethics and governance:  Maintain a zero-tolerance stance on bribery and corruption through policy updates, mandatory compliance training and regular internal audits. The Board ESG Committee will review ESG performance and risk assessments each quarter, drawing upon internal assurance processes. Principle 5: Employee capability and training:  Roll out function-specific ESG training modules so that 100 % of employees complete mandatory training by next FY. Clear, measurable and assignable objectives are a recognised way to enhance accountability. Principle 6: Energy and climate commitments: Increase renewable-energy share:  Expand rooftop solar and group-captive power projects so that renewable sources exceed 45 % of total electricity consumption by FY 2025-26 (up from roughly 37 % in FY 2024-25). Improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon intensity:  Replace obsolete motors and power-distribution panels with efficient technologies and switch from furnace oil to LPG. These actions support a downward trajectory in manufacturing CO2 emissions and align with national decarbonisation goals. Water stewardship and circularity:  Implement additional rainwater-harvesting structures and sewage-treatment capacity to meet a significant portion of non-potable water requirements from harvested or treated sources. Continue composting organic waste and aim for zero untreated discharge. Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 

62 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED 6. Performance of the entity against the specific commitments, goals and targets along-with reasons in case the same are not met. During FY 2024 25, the Company tracked progress against the above commitments through its sustainability database and quarterly ESG reviews. Key outcomes are summarised below: Principle 1: Sustainability database:  UCL adopted ESG tool Karbon provided by Planet Sustech Private Limited which helped in streamlining the ESG data and more robust reporting. A structured ESG database was developed and populated with energy, emissions, water and social data. Data quality and granularity improved significantly, enabling better analytics and more transparent reporting. Integration of facility level systems also developed. Ethics & governance:  The Company maintained its zero-tolerance policy toward bribery and unethical behavior. Internal audits covering all ESG disclosures were implemented, and audit findings were reviewed by the board's audit committee. No ethical violations were reported during the year. Continuous training and periodic policy reviews will sustain compliance. Principle 2: Employee ESG training:  ESG training was expanded with more function specific modules. Coverage improved but was not yet universal. Full employee coverage is targeted by March 2026; logistical constraints (e.g., onboarding of new hires) delayed completion. Principle 6: Renewable energy & energy efficiency:   Appr. 37 % of total electricity consumed was from renewable sources. Rooftop solar plants (2 MW at Satna and 0.5 MW at Goa) operated reliably, and electricity supply from a 4 MW wind solar hybrid project commenced in July 2024. Energy efficiency measures (replacement of DC motors with AC systems, upgrading power panels) reduced electricity demand. Renewable energy share did not yet reach the >45 % target because the hybrid project was commissioned mid year; the target is expected to be met in FY 2025-26. CO 2  emission reductions:  CO 2  emissions intensity fell by 23.87% due to energy efficiency improvements and the switch from furnace oil to LPG for boilers. The company continued to monitor emissions and identify further abatement opportunities. Further reductions are planned through additional renewable procurement and process optimization. Water & waste management:  Two sewage treatment plants commissioned in the previous year (total capacity 70 KL) continued to operate efficiently, raising overall treatment capacity to 270 KL and enabling reuse of treated water for non potable applications. Formal composting of organic waste reduced methane emissions and produced nutrient rich compost. Additional rainwater harvesting:  Structures will be installed to meet larger non potable requirements. Other initiatives:  The Company converted all HVAC systems to environmentally safer refrigerants, installed a LPG distribution system to replace furnace oil, continued tree plantation drives, and enhanced community outreach. These efforts contribute to broader sustainability goals and support stakeholder trust. 

63 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Governance, leadership and oversight 7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 8. Details of the highest authority responsible for implementation and oversight of the Business Responsibility policy (ies). As a forward-looking organization committed to innovation, sustainability, and responsible growth, I am pleased to share key highlights of our Company's progress in advancing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) priorities during the financial year 2024-25. We have made meaningful progress in strengthening our environmental stewardship. During the year, approximately 37% of our total energy consumption was derived from renewable sources. With the commissioning of a 4 MW Wind-Solar Hybrid Power Plant in July 2024 under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement, we anticipate this share to exceed 45% in the coming year, further accelerating our transition to clean energy and reducing our carbon footprint. On the social front, we remain deeply committed to inclusive development and community well-being. Our CSR initiatives in FY 2024-25 included the development of medical facilities at MP Birla Hospital & Research Centre, Chittorgarh (Rajasthan); infrastructure development at Priyamvada Birla Senior Secondary School, Satna (M.P.); and the creation of a dedicated library room with supporting infrastructure at the Government Primary/Middle School in Satrant, Cortalim, Goa. These efforts have significantly enhanced access to healthcare and enriched educational environments, thereby improving the overall quality of life in the communities we serve. In parallel, we expanded our focus on employee awareness and engagement. The aggregate number of training programs increased substantially during the year, with targeted emphasis on function-specific and role-based learning. This initiative has further embedded sustainability values into our organizational culture and day- to-day operations. On the governance front, we continue to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct. Our zero-tolerance policy on bribery and unethical practices is rigorously implemented through comprehensive policies, mandatory training, and ongoing monitoring. These measures reinforce our commitment to transparency, accountability, and stakeholder trust. I take immense pride in the progress we have achieved this year. Our ESG strategy is not just a compliance requirement, rather it is at the heart of how we conduct our business, create value, and contribute to a sustainable and equitable future. As we look ahead, we remain steadfast in our mission to integrate ESG principles across all dimensions of our operations while upholding our core values of ethics, excellence, and equity.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. Plastics The Company ensures responsible handling of plastic waste by channeling it exclusively to (including packaging) authorized recyclers. This promotes environmentally sound disposal practices and contributes to the circular economy by enabling the recycling and reuse of plastic materials. E-waste In  full compliance with regulatory requirements, all electronic waste generated by the Company is sold to government-authorized recyclers. This practice ensures the safe, lawful, and environmentally responsible recycling and disposal of e-waste, thereby minimizing its ecological footprint. Hazardous waste The  Company adopts a stringent and protocol-driven approach to managing hazardous waste. Such waste is disposed of through authorized recyclers in accordance with statutory guidelines and safety standards. This ensures that hazardous materials are handled, transported, and treated in a secure and responsible manner, thereby mitigating associated environmental and health risks. Other waste Acid Batteries: A structured buy-back arrangement with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) is in place for the disposal of used acid batteries. This ensures safe and environmentally compliant handling, reducing the risk of soil and water contamination. Other Non-Hazardous Waste: Non-hazardous waste is responsibly sold to verified and competent vendors who are equipped to manage, reuse, or recycle these materials. This promotes resource efficiency, reduces landfill usage, and supports sustainable material recovery. 4.

Commodity Risk : i. Risk Management Policy : The Company is exposed to the risk arising out of fluctuations in the prices of its key raw materials, viz, Copper, Aluminium and Lead. To mitigate these risks in a structured manner, the Company has implemented a comprehensive risk management framework in the form of “Commodity Risk Management Policy” to safeguard its interests against volatility of commodity prices. The Commodity Risk Management Committee monitors regularly and ensures compliance with procedures enshrined in “the Commodity Risk Management Policy”. The Audit Committee of the Board is periodically apprised of risk management and mitigation measures covering all aspects of operations, including commodity price risk.

Commodity Risk and Mitigation Measures : The Company is affected by the price volatility of aforesaid commodities.

During the year, the Company’s key raw materials faced extreme volatility. While in case of variable price orders, the risk arising due to price fluctuation of raw material was passed on to the customer, in case of fixed price orders, the Company has effectively mitigated these risks by taking future purchase contracts at LME on back to back basis immediately on signing the contract with the customer, without any exception, thereby freezing its margins envisaged while booking the order notwithstanding future price fluctuations.

Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit  of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and Rules thereunder and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we hav e obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalon e Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financia l Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Key Audit Matter Audit Response Revenue recognition for construction contracts: In respect of construction contracts, the management is required to make various accounting estimates and judgements for the purpose of revenue recognition over time like identification of performance obligation, determination of transaction price, the stage of completion, the timing of revenue recognition, estimated project costs and revenue. The process among others, take into consideration contract risks, price variation claims, liquidated damages & penalties, periodic certification from customers, recoverability of trade receivables. The Company periodically reviews the estimates involved and any cumulative effect of such changes are recognized in the period in which such changes are determined. Given the significance of the revenue recognition as stated above, we determined this to be a key audit matter. Our audit procedure included, among others: • We obtained an understanding of the process followed by the Company in determination of the estimates and contract revenue. • We performed walkthrough procedures over the process of identification of performance obligation. • We tested the design and implementation of internal control over the quantification of the estimates used as well as the operating effectiveness of such control. • We tested segregation of duties while recording the contracts in the Company’s information system and recognising revenue from such contracts. • We performed substantive procedures as considered appropriate in accordance with standard on auditing. • We tested appropriateness of the disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements in respect of such construction contracts to ensure compliance with Ind AS 115. Based on our work as stated above, no significant deviations were observed. 

125 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Key Audit Matter Audit Response Valuation of trade receivables in view of the risk of credit losses: Trade receivables is a significant item in the Company’s Standalone Financial Statements as at March 31, 2025 and assumptions used for estimating the credit loss on receivables is an area which is determined by management’s judgment. The Company makes an assessment of the estimated credit losses on trade receivables based on credit risk, project status, past history, latest discussion/ correspondence with the customer. Given the significance of these receivables in the Standalone Financial Statements as at March 31, 2025, we determined this to be a key audit matter. Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report 2024-25 but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, i n doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements, or our knowledg e obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the prepara tion of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance includ ing other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accorda nce with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonabl e and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Stand alone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the goi ng concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realist ic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. Our audit procedure included, among others: • We assessed the company’s processes and controls relating to the monitoring of trade receivables and considered ageing to identify collection risks. • We inquired with senior management regarding status of collectability of the receivables and discussed material outstanding balances with the senior management. • We obtained evidence of receipts subsequent to the year end from the customers. • We assessed management’s assumptions used to calculate the impairment loss on trade receivables, through analyses of ageing of receivables, assessment of significant overdue trade receivables. • We assessed the overall reasonableness of the allowance for doubtful debts. Based on our work as stated above, no significant deviations were observed. 

126 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in  the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes  it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the res ults of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extreme ly rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

131 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT [Referred to in paragraph 2 under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of Universal Cables Limited on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025] Report on the Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Universal Cables Limited (“the Company”) as of Marc h 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control s tated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Acco untants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial con trols that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’ s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of t he accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our  audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (t he “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit  of internal financial controls, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting i ncluded obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on t he Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gen erally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and pro cedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and d ispositions of the assets of the company;(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collu sion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the deg ree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

132 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial report ing and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the int ernal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control s tated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

138 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED (c) Cash Flow Hedge Reserve The Company uses hedging instruments as part of its management of commodity price risk and related foreign currency risk associated with its highly probable forecasted purchases. For hedging commodity price risk and related foreign currency risk, the Company uses future contracts and foreign currency forward contracts respectively which are designated as cash flow hedges. To the extent these hedges are effective, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve. Amounts recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When the forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asse t (e.g. inventory), the amount recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is adjusted against the carrying amount of the non financial asset.

139 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED 1. NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 ST  MARCH, 2025 1.1 Company Overview Universal Cables Limited (UCL) (“the Company”) is a public limited listed company existing under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company is engaged in manufacturing and/or sale of Electrical and other Cables, Wires, Conductors, Accessories for Cables and Conductors, Products for quality power Solutions eg. Capacitors and Capacitor Banks, Harmonic Filters, SVGs, etc. and Turnkey Projects predominantly relating to Electrical Cables, Conductors, Capacitors & Capacitor Banks, etc. The Registered Office of the Company is located at P.O. Birla Vikas, Satna (M.P.) - 485005, India and its CIN No. is L31300MP1945PLC001114. The equity shares of the Company are listed on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE). The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 st  March, 2025 have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors of Company in their Meeting held on 22 nd  May, 2025. 1.2 Basis of Preparation and Presentation The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with and to comply in all material aspects with the applicable Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read together with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions including presentation requirements of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, as amended from time to time. The Standalone Financial Statements have been prepared on accrual and going concern basis under historical cost convention, except for the items that have been measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS. Company’s Standalone Financial Statements are presented in Indian Rupee, which is also its functional currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. All amounts in the Standalone Financial Statements and accompanying notes are presented in Indian Rupees in Lakhs and have been rounded-off to two decimal places in accordance with the provisions of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, unless stated otherwise. 1.3 Basis of classification of Current and Non-Current Assets and Liabilities are classified as either current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle, and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Operating cycle for the business activities of the Company covers the duration of the specific project/contract/product line/service including the defect liability period, wherever applicable, and extends up to the realisation of receivables (including retention monies) within the agreed credit period normally applicable to the respective project/contract/product line/service. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. 1.4 Use of estimates & Critical Judgements The preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in India requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the Standalone Financial Statements and the results of operations during the reporting year end. Although these estimates and associated assumptions are based upon historical experiences and various other factors that are considered relevant besides management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Any revision in the accounting estimates is recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Estimation of contract revenue is a critical accounting judgement [Refer Note 1.5(k)]. 1.5 Summary of Material Accounting policies (a) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) Freehold Land is carried at historical cost. PPE are stated at cost, net of recoverable taxes, discount and rebates, etc. less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing cost (if capitalisation criteria is met) and any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other expenses on existing PPE, including day to day repairs and maintenance expenses and cost of replacing parts, are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which such expenses are incurred. 

140 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Spare parts in the nature of PPE are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their remaining useful lives. Capital work-in-progress (CWIP) comprises of PPE that are not ready for their intended use at the end of reporting period and are carried at cost comprising direct costs, related expenses, other directly attributable costs and borrowing costs (if capitalisation criteria is met) and such properties are classified as appropriate categories of PPE when completed and ready for intended use. The carrying amount of an item of PPE is derecognised on disposal or discard when no further benefit is expected from its use. Items of PPE retired from active use and held for disposal are generally stated at lower of their net book value and net realisable value. Gains or losses arising from de–recognition of PPE is measured as the difference between the net disposable proceeds or net realisable value, as the case may be, and the net carrying amount (net book value) of the asset and are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. Advances paid towards acquisition of PPE and outstanding at each reporting date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the assets not ready to use on or before the reporting date are disclosed under Capital Work-In-Progress (CWIP). (b) Investment Property The Company has certain investments in Land & Buildings which are classified as Investment Property as per the requirement of Ind AS 40. The same is held generally to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both. The Investment Property has been recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. The same has been disclosed separately in the Standalone Financial Statements along with requisite disclosure about fair valuation of such Investment Property at year end. (c) Intangible Assets Intangible assets (mainly comprise of license fees and associated implementation costs incurred for Software) are measured initially at cost only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost can be measured reliably. After initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. (d) Depreciation/Amortisation Depreciation on PPE is provided on straight line method at the rates determined based on the useful lives of respective assets as prescribed in the Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, and/or useful life reviewed and assessed by the Company based on technical evaluation of relevant class of assets, as detailed below: Buildings (as per schedule II) 30/ 60 years Plant and Equipment (as per technical evaluation) 3 to 15 years Office Equipment (as per technical evaluation) 3 to 15 years Furniture and Fixtures (as per schedule II) 10 years Vehicles (as per schedule II) 8 to 10 years Computer and related hardware (as per technical evaluation) 3 years Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment added/disposed-off/discarded during the year is provided on pro-rata basis with respect to the month of addition/disposal/discarding. Leasehold land is amortised on a straight line basis over the period of the lease (30 to 99 years). Intangible Assets are measured at cost and amortised so as to reflect the pattern in which the concerned asset’s economic benefit is reasonably expected to flow to the Company. Accordingly, the useful lives of Intangible Assets have been estimated as five years. Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation is complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted, if considered appropriate. (e) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Assessment is done at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that an asset (PPE and Intangible) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset/cash generating unit (CGU) is made. Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s net selling price and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing 

141 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. For the purpose of assessing impairment, the recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. The smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, is considered as a cash generating unit (CGU). An asset or CGU whose carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Assessment is also done at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. (f) Government Grants and Subsidies Grants and subsidies (including Incentives) from the Government(s) are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them have been complied and grants/subsidy will be received. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to a Property, Plant and Equipment, it is accounted for by deducting the grant from the carrying amount of the Property, Plant and Equipment. Export benefits availed as per applicable policy/schemes are considered accrued and accounted for as such in the year in which the goods are exported subject to no significant uncertainty exists regarding their ultimate collection or availment. (g) Inventories Inventories are valued as follows: Raw Materials, Stores and Spares Lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a transaction moving weighted average basis. However, raw materials and other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost. Traded Goods Lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on transaction moving weighted average basis. Work-in-Progress and Finished Goods Lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct materials (determined on a transaction moving weighted average basis), labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity of relevant production facilities. Scrap Materials Estimated Net Realisable value. Cost comprises all cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost includes the reclassification from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases of raw materials but excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated cost of completion and estimated cost necessary to make the sale. (h) Fair Value Measurement The Company measures financial instruments such as investments (other than equity investments in joint venture and associate) and derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: (i) In the principal market for the asset or liability, or (ii) In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability to which the Company has access at that date. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable; 

142 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For the purpose of Fair value disclosure, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of nature, characteristics and risks of the assets or liabilities and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets and for non-recurring measurement, such as assets held for disposal. (i) Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. (1) Financial Assets (i) Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price. (ii) Subsequent measurement Financial Assets other than Equity Instruments - Financial assets carried at Amortised cost: A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on principal outstanding. Interest income from such financial asset is included in other income using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method. - Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI): A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on principal outstanding. They are subsequently measured at each reporting date at fair value, with all fair value movements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified from the OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss. - Financial asset at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL): A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories is measured at fair value through profit and loss. Equity Instruments - Investment in Joint Ventures and Associates The Company has accounted for its Investments in Joint venture and Associate at cost. - Other Equity Investments All other equity investments are measured at fair value. Equity Investments, which are held for trading are classified as Fair value through Profit and Loss. For equity investments other than held for trading, the Company has exercised irrevocable option to recognise in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ (“OCI”), save and except passive long term investments in a power producer company for sourcing of renewable energy which are measured at cost by treating it as fair value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) as per the governing terms and conditions of the Power Purchase Agreement (Refer Note No. 7). The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis for those investments which are strategic and are not intended for sale. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. Gain/ losses on disposal of such investments are transferred from OCI to Retained Earnings. 

143 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED (iii) Derecognition of financial instruments The Company derecognises financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. (iv) Impairment of Financial Assets The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company determines expected credit losses after taking into account the past history of recovery, risk of default of the counterparty, existing market conditions, etc, and after considering all reasonable and supportable information including that which is forward looking, while assessing credit risk. The impairment methodology is applied on individual customer basis and depends on whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. (2) Financial Liabilities (v) Recognition and Initial Measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as at fair value through statement of profit and loss, loans and borrowings, payables or as derivatives, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. (vi) Subsequent Measurement Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in the statement of profit and loss. (vii) Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. (viii) Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Derivative Financial Instruments (ix) Derivatives and hedging activities Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. However, where derivatives do not meet the hedge accounting criteria, they are classified as ‘held for trading’ for accounting purposes and are accounted for at FVTPL. They are presented as current assets or liabilities to the extent they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Company designates their derivatives as hedges of commodity price risk and related foreign exchange risk associated with the cash flows of assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges). The Company documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of each hedge relationship. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months but the same is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 

144 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED (x) Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in cash flow hedging reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss, within other gains/(losses). When forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Company designate the full change in fair value of the forward contract as the hedging instrument. The gains and losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire forward contract are recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve within equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when the forecast purchase that is hedged takes place). When the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example inventory), the amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to profit or loss as follows:- With respect to gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the forward contracts, the deferred hedging gains and losses are included within the initial cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognized in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, through cost of sales). When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss within other gains/(losses). If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing. (xi) Derivatives that are not designated as hedges The Company enters certain derivative contracts to hedge risks which are not designated as hedges. Such contracts are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss and are included in statement of profit and loss. (xii) Embedded derivatives Derivatives embedded in a host contract that is an asset within the scope of Ind AS 109 are not separated. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. Derivatives embedded in all other host contract are separated only if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host and are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives closely related to the host contracts are not separated. (j) Income Taxes Tax expense comprises current income tax and deferred tax. Current income tax expense is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the concerned tax authorities in accordance with the governing provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 as amended, modified and notified from time to time. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. The Company uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which are exercised while determining the provisions for Income Tax. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 

145 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Income tax (Current and Deferred) is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent it relates to the items recognised directly in equity or Other Comprehensive Income. Current tax assets and Current tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set of the recognised amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (k) Revenue Recognition Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for those goods and/or services. The Company satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met: (i) The Company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternate use to the Company and the Company has as an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. (ii) The Company’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced. (iii) The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance as the Company performs. For performance obligations where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. Revenue is recognized to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably. Taxes (Goods and Services Tax) collected on behalf of the government are excluded from Revenue. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration on account returns, discounts, customer claims and rebates, etc. Variable consideration includes volume discounts, price concessions, incentives, etc. The Company estimates the variable consideration with respect to above based on an analysis of accumulated historical experience. The variable consideration is adjusted as and when the expectation regarding the same changes. Revenue from Sale of Goods Performance obligation in case of Revenue from sale of goods is satisfied at a point in time and is recognized when control of goods is transferred to the customers. Generally, control is transferred upon shipment of goods to the customer or when the goods are made available to the customer, provided transfer of title to the customer occurs and the Company has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the goods shipped. Revenue from Turnkey Projects/Contracts Performance obligation in case of revenue from Turnkey Projects/Contracts is satisfied over the period of time, since the customer controls the assets as they are created and the Company has enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue from Turnkey Projects/Contracts, where the outcome can be estimated reliably is recognised under the percentage of completion method by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity. The stage of completion is measured by input method i.e. the proportion that the cost incurred to date bear to the estimated total cost of a contract. The estimates of contract costs and the revenue thereon are reviewed periodically by the management and the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimates is recognised in the period in which such changes are determined. Where it is probable that contract expenses will exceed total revenue from a contract, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If contract revenue recognised is in excess of interim/progressive billing, the same is recognised as “contract asset” (unbilled revenue). Similarly, if interim/progressive billing exceeds contract revenue, the same is recognised as “contract liabilities” (excess billed over revenue). Amounts received before the related work is performed are disclosed in the Balance Sheet as “Mobilisation and Other Advances from Customers”. The amounts billed to customers for work performed and are unconditionally due for payment i.e. only passage of time is required before payment falls due, are disclosed in the Balance Sheet as trade receivables. The amount of retention money receivable from project customers do not contain any significant financing element as these are retained by the customers for satisfactory performance of the underlying contracts. Interest income is recognised on time proportion basis. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. 

146 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED (l) Interest in Joint Arrangements As per Ind AS 111 - Joint Arrangements, investment in Joint Arrangement is classified as either Joint Operation or Joint Venture. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor rather than legal structure of the Joint Arrangement. (m) Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, production or development of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they are incurred. Transaction costs in respect of long term borrowing are amortised over the tenure of respective loans using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. (n) Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Assets The Company recognises a provision when there is a present obligation as a result of past event that probably requires an outflow of resources and reliable estimates can be made of the amount of obligation The provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The timing of recognition requires application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances which may be subject to change. A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is possible obligation or a present obligation that will probably not require outflow of resources or where a reliable estimate of the obligation cannot be made. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation and likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Provision for warranty related costs are recognised when the terms and conditions attached to and forming part of the executed portion of the contract of sale of products and/or providing of services or both are assessed to have underlying obligations to be met during the warranty period. The estimate of such warranty costs is revised annually. Contingent assets are not recognised but disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements , where economic inflow is probable. (o) Employee Benefits (i) Defined Contribution Plans Contributions to approved Superannuation Fund as per Company’s scheme and Pension Fund/Employees Recognised Provident Fund administered by Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year when the employee renders the related service. The Company recognises contributions payable under the relevant plan(s) as an expense, when an eligible employee renders the related services. (ii) Defined Benefit Plans Gratuity, Pension and Compensated Absences benefits, payable as per Company’s schemes are considered as defined benefit schemes and are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss on the basis of actuarial valuation carried out at the end of each financial year by independent actuaries using Projected Unit Credit Method. For the purpose of presentation of defined benefit plans, the allocation between short term and long term provisions is made as determined by the independent actuaries. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. The Provident fund Contribution, other than Contribution to Employees Recognised Provident Fund administered by EPFO, is made to an approved trust of the Company administered by the trustees. The Company has representation on the board of trust. The Company is liable for shortfall, if any, in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return and the same is recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Ex-gratia or other amount disbursed on account of selective employees separation scheme or otherwise are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred/determined. (p) Operating Leases (i) Where the Company is the Lessee The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for Buildings. The Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a lease or not a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a consideration. The Company has elected not to recognise Right-of-use Assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets and the corresponding lease rental paid are 

147 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED directly charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The Company recognises a Right-of-use Asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The Right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial costs incurred. The Right-of-use Asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured on amortised cost basis. (ii) Where the Company is the Lessor Lease under which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset is classified as operating lease. Assets subject to operating lease are included in Investment Property. Lease income from operating lease is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the lease term except where the lease payments are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation. Costs including depreciation are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. (q) Foreign Currency Transactions / Translations Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary items are translated into functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the exchange rates different from those at which they were initially recorded during the year, or reported in previous Standalone Financial Statements , are recognised as income or expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise. (r) Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of the equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential equity shares. (s) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and Cash equivalent for the purposes of cash flow statement comprise cash on hand, cheques in hand, demand deposits with banks and short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and Cash Equivalents consists of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage. 1.6 Indian Accounting Standard(s) Pronouncements The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India notifies the new Indian Accounting Standards/Amendments to the existing Indian Accounting Standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 from time to time which are evaluated for giving effect to in the preparation and presentation of Standalone Financial Statements to the extent the same apply and extend to the Company.

Financial Risk Management: The Company’s activities are exposed to a variety of Financial Risks from its Operations. The key financial risks include Credi t Risk, Market Risk and Liquidity Risk. The Company also uses derivative instruments on selective basis prudently to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its financial performance in accordance Risk Management Policy framework. (a) Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial loss to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily arising from trade receivables from customers and other financial instruments. Customer credit risk is managed as per the Company’s established policy, procedures and control framework relating to customer credit risk management. The Company assesses the credit quality of the counterparties taking into account their financial position and credit worthiness, the age of specific receivable balance and the current and expected collection trends, age of its contracts in progress, historically observed default over the expected life of trade receivables. Credit ris k on trade receivables is limited due to the Company’s large and diverse customer base which includes public sector enterprises (including metro railways), central/state power utilities, renowned private sector utilities and large industrial customers having good credit rating(s). Credit risk is reduced to a significant extent if the turnkey project(s) have sufficien t financial closure in the form of assured funding/budgetary support from the Central/State Government(s) or its financing agencies or commercial banks, etc. and achieving project milestone within the contracted completion schedule. Credit risk is also actively managed to the extent feasible by securing payment through letter(s) of credit, advance payment and 

174 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED bill discounting facility. The Company’s exposure (unsecured trade receivables) and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and assessed while ensuring that the aggregate value of transactions is reasonably spread amongst counterparties. The Company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment allowance on trade receivables, if any, on the reporting date and accordingly applied the same for measurement and recognition of impairment losses on trade receivables. Movement in the expected credit loss allowance of financial assets : ( `  in lakhs) Particulars As at As at 31 st  March, 2025 31 st  March, 2024 Fixed Rate Instruments Balance at beginning of the year  869.16  819.00 Add: Allowance during the year  135.59  50.16 Less: Reversal of Allowance during the year  (716.17)  - Closing at end of the year  288.58  869.16 (b) Market Risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency Trade Receivables and Trade Payables. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. Thus, exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing acticities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currency. (i) Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency transactions of imports, exports and borrowings primarily with respect to USD, Euro and Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY). The Company’s exports are denominated generally in USD and Euro thereby providing a natural hedge to that extent against foreign currency payments on account of imports of raw materials and/or the re-payment of borrowings and interest thereon. The foreign currency transaction risk is also managed through selective hedging by way of forward contracts for underlying transactions having firm commitments or highly probable forecast of crystalisation. The Company has entered into certain derivative contracts for hedging the exposure in foreign currency and has recognised a gain/loss in the Statement of Profit & Loss on measurement of said contracts at fair value on the reporting date. The fair value of derivative instrument is measured based on valuation received from the authorised dealer (Bank).

Such debts/borrowings are based on fixed as well as floating interest rate(s). The Company mitigates this risk by regularly assessing the market scenario and if considered appropriate based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on selective basis.

177 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED (iv) Commodity Price Risk The volatility in prices of certain key commodity raw materials, packing materials, etc. can significantly impact cost and profitability of the Company. Its operating activities require the purchase of raw materials and other commodity products for manufacturing of Cables, Capacitors, etc. and certain bought out components for execution of Turnkey Contract(s) and related/incidental Services. It requires a continuous supply of certain raw materials and bought out components such as copper, aluminum, polymers, steel, jointing kits, etc. The prices of certain commodities eg. copper, aluminium, steel and polymers are subject to considerable volatility. Since the market prices in certain contracts are fixed on firm price basis, the fluctuation in prices of these commodities can severely impact the cost of the product or turnkey project, as the case may be. The Company gives priority to customers who allow price variation on major commodity input raw materials to avoid such risks. The Commodity price risk for certain key commodity raw material items eg. copper and aluminium is also managed through selective hedging by way of future contracts on London Metal Exchange (LME) and also through forward booking with the suppliers on a case to case basis after due assessment of underlying risk. Occasionally, scarcity of polymers in the global market and price volatility due to geo political and variety of other reasons is a risk in terms of meeting customer’s delivery commitments. To mitigate such risk, the Company procures materials in tranches to even out price fluctuation. Also, the Company has tied up with globally renowned suppliers for timely supply at competitive prices for meeting the requirement of imported polymer products to manage the cost in volatile environment without any compromise on quality. (c) Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk where the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach is to ensure as far as possible that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due and accordingly it manages the risk in a manne r so as to meet its normal financial obligations without any significant delay or stress. Further, the management has arranged for diversified funding sources and adopted a policy of managing assets with liquidity in mind.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the prepara tion and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial positi on, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in  accordance with Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of the adequate accounting records in accordan ce with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irreg ularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; a nd design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring th e accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give  a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of prepa ration of the Consolidated Financials Statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group ar e responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, mat ters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either inten ds to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detec t a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individuall y or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error , design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appr opriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company and and upon consideration of respective auditors’ reports of its associate and joint venture company which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures a re inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 

188 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within  the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the Financial Statements of such entities or business activities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities or business activities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by the other auditor, such other auditor remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, make s it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in eva luating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditor regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during ou r audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describ e these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extreme ly rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Other matters We did not audit the financial statements and other information of a joint venture. The Consolidated Financial Statements inclu des Group’s share of profit / (loss) after tax of ( `  981.46) Lakhs and total comprehensive income of ( `  981.18) Lakhs for the year ended March 31, 2025 in the joint venture. These financial statements have been audited by the other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management. Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of a joint venture and our report in terms of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Act in  so far it relates to the aforesaid joint venture, is based on the reports of the other auditors. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

192 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED ANNEXURE 1 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT [Referred to under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of Universal Cables Limited on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025] Report on the Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Universal Cables Limited (“the Company”) its  one associate and a joint venture company (together referred to as the “Group”) whose audit reports have been provided to us and which are companies incorporated in India and referred to in “other matters” paragraph in our Independent Auditor’s Report of t he even date. Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the Group which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Comp any considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Ov er Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the desi gn, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly  and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention an d detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our  audit and based on the consideration of the reports of other auditors on separate audited financial statements of the associate and j oint venture companies as referred to in the Other Matters paragraph in the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of interna l financial controls, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical require- ments and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting i ncluded obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained including consideration of the reports of other auditors on separate audite d financial statements of the associate and joint venture Company, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company, its associate and a joint venture Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting . Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gen erally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and pro ce- dures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company;(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permi t preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expendi- tures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of t he Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

193 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collu sion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the deg ree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion the Company, one associate and a joint venture company have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating  effec- tively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company conside ring the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

225 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED 48. Financial Risk Management: The Company’s activities are exposed to a variety of Financial Risks from its Operations. The key financial risks include Credi t Risk, Market Risk and Liquidity Risk. The Company also uses derivative instruments on selective basis prudently to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its financial performance in accordance Risk Management Policy framework. (a) Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial loss to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily arising from trade receivables from customers and other financial instruments. Customer credit risk is managed as per the Company’s established policy, procedures and control framework relating to customer credit risk management. The Company assesses the credit quality of the counterparties taking into account their financial position and credit worthiness, the age of specific receivable balance and the current and expected collection trends, age of its contracts in progress, historically observed default over the expected life of trade receivables. Credit ris k on trade receivables is limited due to the Company’s large and diverse customer base which includes public sector enterprises (including metro railways), central/state power utilities, renowned private sector utilities and large industrial customers having good credit rating(s). Credit risk is reduced to a significant extent if the turnkey project(s) have sufficien t financial closure in the form of assured funding/budgetary support from the Central/State Government(s) or its financing agencies or commercial banks, etc. and achieving project milestone within the contracted completion schedule. Credit risk is also actively managed to the extent feasible by securing payment through letter(s) of credit, advance payment and bill discounting facility. The Company’s exposure (unsecured trade receivables) and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and assessed while ensuring that the aggregate value of transactions is reasonably spread amongst counterparties. The Company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment allowance on trade receivables, if any, on the reporting date and accordingly applied the same for measurement and recognition of impairment losses on trade receivables. Movement in the expected credit loss allowance of financial assets : ( `  in lakhs) Particulars As at As at 31 st  March, 2025 31 st  March, 2024 Balance at beginning of the year  869.16  819.00 Add: Allowance during the year  135.59  50.16 Less: Reversal of Allowance during the year  (716.17)  - Closing at end of the year  288.58  869.16 (b) Market Risk: Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency Trade Receivables and Trade Payables. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. Thus, exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing acticities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currency. (i) Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency transactions of imports, exports and borrowings primarily with respect to USD, Euro and Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY). The Company’s exports are denominated generally in USD and Euro thereby providing a natural hedge to that extent against foreign currency payments on account of imports of raw materials and/or the re-payment of borrowings and interest thereon. The foreign currency transaction risk is also managed through selective hedging by way of forward contracts for underlying transactions having firm commitments or highly probable forecast of crystalisation. The Company has entered into certain derivative contracts for hedging the exposure in foreign currency and has recognised a gain/loss in the Statement of Profit & Loss on measurement of said contracts at fair value on the reporting date. The fair value of derivative instrument is measured based on valuation received from the authorised dealer (Bank).

Such debts/borrowings are based on fixed as well as floating interest rate(s). The Company mitigates this risk by regularly assessing the market scenario and if considered appropriate based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on selective basis.

Its operating activities require the purchase of raw materials and other commodity products for manufacturing of Cables, Capacitors, etc. and certain bought out components for execution of Turnkey Contract(s) and related/incidental Services. It requires a continuous supply of certain raw materials and bought out components such as copper, aluminum, polymers, steel, jointing kits, etc. The prices of certain commodities eg. copper, aluminium, steel and polymers are subject to considerable volatility. Since the market prices in certain contracts are fixed on firm price basis, the fluctuation in prices of these commodities can severely impact the cost of the product or turnkey project, as the case may be. The Company gives priority to customers who allow price variation on major commodity input raw materials to avoid such risks. The Commodity price risk for certain key commodity raw material items eg. copper and aluminium is also managed through selective hedging by way of future contracts on London Metal Exchange (LME) and also through forward booking with the suppliers on a case to case basis after due assessment of underlying risk. Occasionally, scarcity of polymers in the global market and price volatility due to geo political and variety of other reasons is a risk in terms of meeting customer’s delivery commitments. To mitigate such risk, the Company procures materials in tranches to even out price fluctuation. Also, the Company has tied up with globally renowned suppliers for timely supply at competitive prices for meeting the requirement of imported polymer products to manage the cost in volatile environment without any compromise on quality. (c) Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk where the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach is to ensure as far as possible that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due and accordingly it manages the risk in a manne r so as to meet its normal financial obligations without any significant delay or stress. Further, the management has arranged for diversified funding sources and adopted a policy of managing assets with liquidity in mind. The Company has also developed appropriate internal control system and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk by regular assessment of expected cash flows and availability of alternative sources of additional funding, if required. As such, the Company believes that sufficient working capital is available to meet its currently assessed requirements. The table below summarises the maturity profile of Company’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments: ( `  in lakhs) Particulars As at 31 st  March, 2025 As at 31 st  March, 2024 Less than 1 year to More than Total Less than 1 year to More than Total 1 year 5 years 5 years 1 year 5 years 5 years Non-derivative Borrowings  45926.21  37667.83  1063.64  84657.68  57305.88  19544.27  -  76850.15 Trade payables  31967.15  202.75  -  32169.90  32717.10  190.84  -  32907.94 Lease Liability  54.75  165.98  -  220.73  47.17  205.04  -  252.21 Other Financial Liabilities  5984.45  498.19  - 6482.64  2764.37  450.67  43.44  3258.48 Total Non-derivative  83932.56  38534.75  1063.64 123530.95  92834.52  20390.82  43.44 113268.78 Derivative  355.85  -  -  355.85  3.80  -  -  3.80 

229 UNIVERSAL CABLES LIMITED (d) Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The fair values of all derivatives are separately recorded in the Balance Sheet within current and non-current assets and liabilities. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative. The use of derivatives can give rise to credit and market risk. The Company as far as possible mitigates the risk by entering into contracts only with reputable banks and financial institutions. The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management. The limits, authorities and monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by the management and the Audit Committee and Risk Management Committee of the Board. The market risk on derivatives is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management purposes. (i) Cash flow hedges The Company enters into forward exchange and commodity price contracts for hedging highly probable forecast transaction and account for them as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in equity through OCI until the hedged transaction occurs, at which time, the respective gain or losses are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When the forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (e.g., inventory), the amount recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted against the carrying amount of the non-financial asset. These hedges have been effective for the year ended 31 st  March 2025. The Company uses foreign exchange contracts from time to time to optimize commodity related exchange rate risk. Fair value changes on such forward contracts are recognized in other comprehensive income. The majority of cash flow hedges taken relates to hedging the foreign exchange rate of highly probable forecast transactions and commodity price contracts for hedging the commodity price risk of highly probable forecast transactions. The cash flows related to above are expected to occur during the year ended 31 st  March 2026 and consequently may impact profit or loss for that year depending upon the change in the commodity prices and foreign exchange rates movements. (ii) Fair  value hedge The fair value hedges relate to forward covers taken to hedge currency exposure. The Company uses foreign exchange contracts from time to time to optimize currency risk exposure on its foreign currency transactions. Fair value changes on such forward contracts are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The fair value of the company’s derivative positions recorded under derivative financial assets and derivative financial liabilities are as follows.
