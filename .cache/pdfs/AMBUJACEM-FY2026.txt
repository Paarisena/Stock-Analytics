MESSAGE FROM    THE CHAIRMAN Our objectives are aligned with India’s ambitions.  And   our strength comes from the belief that you –  our   shareholders – place in us. Dear Stakeholders, Let me begin with a salute and a bow of gratitude as a  fellow citizen who deeply acknowledges the courage of  our brothers and sisters that guard our peace. During Operation Sindoor, our brave men and women  in uniform stood tall, not for recognition, but for duty.  Times like these make us realise that peace cannot  be taken for granted. It is earned through decades of  silent sacrifice, unwavering resolve and strength built  far from the spotlight, in the deserts, on the borders  and deep at sea. Our achievements as a nation do not just lie in balance  sheets or boardrooms but also belong to the soldiers  who stand watch while we build, and to the uniform  that chooses service while we chase ambition. It is with this humbling sense of purpose that I write  to you today. In 2024-25, the Adani Group delivered  yet another year of significant growth. Growth built  on the bedrock of your unwavering trust, and a belief  in the long arc of transformation. And we have not  grown in calm seas. We have grown in the middle of  global turbulence. Over 60 nations have gone to the polls, redrawing  maps, rewriting alliances. Conflicts in the Middle  East have disrupted energy flows and logistics  corridors. Europe, once an economic stronghold, now  grapples with stagnation and a search for identity in a  fractured world. In the midst of all this, our country stood apart. While prudence elsewhere buckled under pressure,  India surged forward as a beacon of stability, of  growth amidst uncertainty and of confidence  amidst confusion. Yes, we have the wind at our back, a demographic  dividend, a booming digital economy and infrastructure  built at record pace. But make no mistake, this  momentum did not happen by chance. It is the result of vision. Of intent. Of policy with  purpose. I say this with full conviction that the Indian  Government, both at the Centre and across the states,  has laid down the foundation for a truly historic  transformation. A transformation not of a few, but for an  entire nation rising with ambition that declares - India’s  best chapters are just beginning. And together, we are  not just witnessing history. We are helping shape it. As a youngster, I saw my mother as my guiding star.  I recall her often saying: "ભાારતીીય સાામ્રાાજ્યોોનુંં� ભાાગ્ય  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં�  નું  હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ ક્યાા ર ેય  પ તીનું   પ ામ્ ય ા  નુંહી � , પણ  તી ેઓએ રચ્ ય ં� હ તી ં� જે ે ઓ દ ર ેક પ તીનું  પછીી વધુ ં   શક્તિ� શ ાળીી અ નું ે અખં � ડ  સા� કલ્પ સાાથેે ફ ર ી ઊભાા રહ્યાં ા �."  Translated, it meant, "The future of India's empires was  not written by those who never accepted defeat, but by  those brave hearts who turned every fall into a stepping  stone - and each time rose again with stronger resolve  to change history." She would often tell me: “Gautam, history does not remember sailors who sailed  in calm waters; it remembers those who braved the  wildest storms and still returned home." And my dear shareholders, that is exactly what we  have done. Even in the face of fierce headwinds and relentless  scrutiny – we have never retreated. Instead – we have  recalibrated. We have reimagined. And we have become  – more formidable, more unbreakable, more stronger  and more resilient! People often ask me: “How does the Adani Group keep  doing it? How do we rise, time and again?” My answer remains the same: Our conviction is  anchored in clarity. Our objectives are aligned with  India’s ambitions. And our strength comes from the  belief that you – our shareholders – place in us. And all of this was tested last year, when we faced  allegations from the US Department of Justice and the  SEC relating to Adani Green Energy. Let me be clear: this was not the first time we have been  tested. Nor will it be the last. Every challenge sharpens  our resolve. Every setback becomes a stepping stone. Despite all the noise, the facts are that – no one from  the Adani Group has been charged with violating the  FCPA or conspiring to obstruct justice. We live in a  We have become –    more formidable,  more unbreakable,  more stronger and  more resilient! - GAUTAM ADANI Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 34 35 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 

world where negativity often echoes louder than truth.  But as we cooperate with legal processes, let me also  restate - emphatically - our governance is of global  standards, and our compliance frameworks are robust  and non-negotiable. And while the numbers tell their own compelling story  – in a year of record-breaking revenue, unprecedented  growth and historic profitability – the deeper truth is  that these milestones are reflections of our relentless  strength and tenacity. They are proof of a Group that  dares to dream beyond constraints, powered by a nation  that breathes possibility into every tomorrow ahead  of us. Let me now talk about a few of the highlights of  FY   2024-25. Across all our sectors, we did more than  just scale – we created impact, inspired change, and  most importantly, deepened our national commitment. Adani Power crossed 100 billion units of power  generation, added 2.3 GW of conventional capacity,  funded  `   12,000+ crore in capex mainly through  internal accruals, and secured a 1,500 MW PPA in  Maharashtra. It is now well on track to reach 31 GW  capacity by 2030. Adani Green reached an operational renewable energy  capacity of over 14 GW and is on target to build the  world’s largest renewable energy plant of 30 GW at  Khavda and a total of 50 GW of renewables capacity  by 2030. Also, with over 5,000 MW of pumped  hydro storage targeted to be installed by 2030 and a  40-year 1,250 MW energy storage PPA with UPPCL,  we are setting global benchmarks in the space of  energy transition. Adani Energy Solutions had a huge year. It secured  `   43,990 crore in transmission orders and executed  `   13,600 crore worth of smart metering projects.  It retained its no. 1 DISCOM rank in India and became  the only private player with three national HVDC grid  links in its portfolio. Adani New Industries is aligned with the nation's  sustainability goals and has an order book for  construction of a 300 MW electrolyser plant. It also  launched an electrolyser testing lab at Mundra. It is  on track to expand its solar module manufacturing  lines and will have a 10 GW integrated solar  module manufacturing facility in place by the next  financial year. Adani Ports continued to strengthen its value  proposition as an Integrated Transport Utility with  unparalleled waterfront to customer gate capabilities.  Adani Ports handled an all-time high cargo volume of  th e courage of our Armed Forces. This is the spirit of  Atmanirbharta. This is the future we are grateful to have  an opportunity to help build. And the same applies to building Data Centers that  India needs to stay competitive in the technology  space. With the surge in AI, AdaniConneX is scaling fast.  We have projects exceeding 210 MW in various stages of  construction in partnership with the global hyperscalers  and have launched a giga-scale renewable-powered data  center campus in Navi Mumbai. Continuing the path of sustainability, Adani Total  Gas is playing a defining role in India’s clean energy  transition. As of this year, we serve close to 1 million PNG  customers and operate 647 CNG stations. Our roadmap  is to double both by 2030. Our e-mobility footprint  now spans 22 states and 4 union territories, with over  3,400 EV charging points installed, thereby positioning  us at the forefront of India’s evolving sustainable  energy ecosystem. But perhaps our most transformative project is unfolding  in Dharavi - Asia’s largest slum, now being reimagined  as India’s most ambitious urban rehabilitation project.  Over 1 million people will move from narrow lanes to  sunlit, modern homes. Inspired by Singapore’s housing  model and co-designed with global experts, the township  will feature spacious layouts, dual toilets, open spaces,  schools, hospitals, transit hubs and parks. Our Dharavi Social Mission is uplifting youth through  skilling, healthcare and employment programmes. A new  multi-modal mobility hub, amphitheatre, cloud kitchens  and riverfront are being planned to serve all of Mumbai. In terms of consolidated numbers, at the Group level,  revenues grew by 7%, EBITDA by 8.2%, and our Net  Debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained healthy at 2.6x. But, as I have stated in the past, our objective is  not to just build businesses - it is to create new  possibilities. Not just to serve markets - but to serve  our nation’s destiny. And in this context, our capital  investment across businesses is set to break all  records. We anticipate an annual CAPEX spend of  USD 15-20 billion for the next 5 years. These are  not just investments in our Group, but investments  in the possibilities for doing our part to build  India’s infrastructure. Before I start wrapping up, let me outline some of the  programmes that have me the most excited about. Exactly three years ago, on my 60 th  birthday,  my family pledged  `   60,000 crore to redefine  healthcare, education, and skill development in India.  450 MMT and achieved a 27% market share in India.  Adani Ports also continued to strengthen its logistics  network within the Indian hinterland across its diverse  range of assets including rakes, multi-modal logistics  parks, warehouses, agri silos and trucks, in addition  to starting freight forwarding services and a trucking  management platform. Adani Ports' marine division  also completed the successful acquisition of Astro  Offshore during the year and is set to deliver 3x growth  by FY   2026-27. Adani Natural Resources too had a very strong  year contributing to India's energy independence.  It produced a record 47 million tonnes of coal and  iron ore and is on track to achieve over 30% growth  by FY 2025-26. We also pioneered India’s first  hydrogen-powered mining truck as well as launched  an e-commerce platform that will soon enable  online trading of LPG, rock phosphate, copper and  precious metals. Also, in line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, Kutch  Copper has successfully produced its first copper anode  at Mundra thereby marking a strategic move in India’s  capability to meet the surging demand for energy  transition materials. Two and a half years ago, when we acquired  Holcim’s India cement business, we had made a bold  commitment: to double our capacity to 140 MTPA by  FY 2027-28. Today, I am proud to share that we have  already achieved 72% of that target and crossed the  100 MTPA milestone, becoming the ninth-largest  cement company globally. Adani Airports also had a record year of growth.  It launched Aviio – India’s first unified airport operations  app as well as reinforced its position as the country’s  fastest-growing airport operator. We handled a record  94 million passengers in FY 2024-25, registering a  7% growth. We also completed the first test flight at  the greenfield Navi Mumbai Airport, which will open  later this year with an initial passenger capacity of  20   million of what will eventually become a 90 million  passenger airport. When it comes to Adani Defence, we now stand at  the dawn of a new era. Our world-class ammunition  and missile capabilities in Kanpur is a vision to forge  one of South Asia's most formidable complexes.  When Operation Sindoor called, we delivered.  Our surveillance drones became the eyes in the skies,  our kamikaze drones became the swift swords of  attack, and our anti-drone systems became the shield  to help protect our forces and citizens. Every innovation  we make and every system we build is a salute to  The Adani Healthcare Temples are our first major  step – world-class, affordable 1,000-bed campuses  in Ahmedabad and Mumbai with medical colleges,  research centres and wellness spaces all integrated  together. Mayo Clinic is our partner in guiding us  to create a future-ready, AI-powered, patient-first  healthcare ecosystem. In parallel, we have committed  `  2,000 crore to build  a world-class skill university and finishing school in  Mundra, designed to empower youth from across India.  Through Schools of Excellence, global certifications  and partnerships with leaders like ITEES Singapore and  IGCC, we aim to create an industry-ready workforce.  This is more than philanthropy – it is our promise to  India because we believe that we are building not just  institutions, but legacies of transformation. And finally, let me end by talking about our participation  at the Maha Kumbh Mela. Over 650 million people  came together, not as strangers, but as one soul.  One purpose. One heartbeat. Along with ISKCON, the  Adani Group initiated the Mahaprasad Seva, offering  free meals to lakhs of devotees. More than 5,000 of our  employees volunteered wholeheartedly, reflecting the  values we cherish. With my family, I had the honour of performing the  sacred Ganga Aarti at the Triveni Sangam – and for  the Adani Group to be part of this was one of the  most moving days of my life. For me, the Maha Kumbh  is not just a festival. It is India’s soul on display – a  living testimony to our resilience, our unity and our  unwavering faith. And we were grateful to have had the  opportunity to perform seva at this year's Maha Kumbh. Let me conclude by saying that history should  remember us not for the size of our balance sheet,  but for the strength of our backbone. Not just for the  markets we entered, but for the storms we handled and  emerged stronger. For it is easy to lead in sunshine, but  true leadership is forged in the face of crisis. Strength is not just power – it is purpose, clarity and the  will to rise. And resilience is not endurance alone – it is  reinvention in the face of adversity. When combined, it  helps us do our part for building an India that refuses to  bend, refuses to break and never stops believing in its  own future. That is our truth. That is our legacy. That is our promise. The greatest chapters of our story are still ahead.  Thank you for being on this journey with us. Jai Hind.

Strengthening Brand Trust  and Digital Leadership  We have always believed that  strong brands are built on trust,  purpose, and progress. Over the  past year, we have deepened our  emotional connection with the  nation through powerful campaigns  that celebrate the spirit of  everyday Indians—those whose  quiet resilience strengthens the  foundation of our country. The ‘Tum  Virat Ho’ campaign, launched on  India’s 78 th  Independence Day,  exemplified this belief, honouring  individuals whose extraordinary  actions uplift their communities.  Coupled with our presence across  key platforms, including premier  cricket tournaments, and extensive  engagement with channel partners,  contractors, and engineers, we  continue to amplify our visibility  and reinforce our leadership  across markets. Equally transformative has been  our commitment to digitalisation.  We have taken bold strides to  embed technology across the  value chain—leveraging AI, IoT,  automation, and advanced analytics  to improve operational efficiency,  enhance customer engagement,  and strengthen sustainability.  The launch of our NexGen Sales &  Reward Platform and the continued  rollout of the ‘Plants of the Future’  programme are paving the way for  a smarter, more agile organisation.  Our partnership with Adani Group’s  AI Labs and robust cybersecurity  infrastructure further ensures  resilience and future readiness. Together, these efforts reflect our  dual commitment to lead not just  as a cement manufacturer, but as a  brand with purpose and a business  with foresight. As we look ahead,  we remain focused on building  a stronger, smarter, and more  sustainable Ambuja Cements —one  that delivers enduring value to  all stakeholders.

Over the past 30 months, we have  added approximately 50% capacity,  expanding our footprint by about  1 million tonnes every month.  This rapid growth underscores our  commitment to not just participate  in the industry but to lead it. Ambuja Cements, now a core  part of the Adani Group’s cement  business, contributes to nearly 30%  A Resilient  Journey with  a Growth  Mindset We have crossed  100 million  tonnes per annum  (MTPA) of our  consolidated  cement capacity,  becoming the 9 th   largest cement  company globally.  of India’s homes and infrastructure.  This is a story of resilience fueled by  a growth mindset — a journey that  marries legacy with innovation and  is inspired by a clear and purposeful  vision. Our progress stands as a  testament to the focused execution,  agility, and ambition that define our  transformation. A key catalyst behind this success  has been our series of efficient  and timely acquisitions, each  completed with precision and  synergy. Alongside inorganic  growth, our organic expansion  projects continue to gain strong  momentum across the country,  bringing us closer to our ambitious  long-term target of reaching 140  MTPA by 2028. This combination  of strategic acquisitions and  greenfield expansions is designed  to build a resilient and scalable  business model, capable of delivering  sustained growth and value. Having achieved nearly 50% growth  in just 30 months, our roadmap is  clear: reaching 118 MTPA by FY 2026  and 140 MTPA by FY 2028, primarily  through brownfield expansion  projects.

These values serve as our guiding  compass, influencing every decision  we make, every process we refine,  every product we deliver, and every  relationship we nurture. RESQ is  more than a framework; it is the  spirit and culture that infuses our  business at every level. The 100 MTPA  milestone, while  deeply gratifying, is  not ours alone. It is  the outcome of the  firm commitment  of our people,  the trust of our  partners, and the  visionary leadership    that continues to    guide us.

Our adherence to RESQ principles  has been fundamental to reinforcing  our market leadership. We are  driven not by short-term gains  but by long-term commitments  that emphasise operational  excellence, rigorous safety practices,  and a profound responsibility  towards the environment and the  communities we serve. This RESQ-driven approach  has enabled us to achieve  holistic, balanced growth —  spanning financial, operational,  and sustainable dimensions.  It demonstrates the resilience and  adaptability of our business model,  particularly as we navigate evolving  market cycles and the challenges of  a dynamic global economy. Our journey is not defined solely  by milestones or numerical  achievements. More importantly, it is  about the trust we continue to earn  from our customers, the enduring  value we co-create with our partners,  and the meaningful legacy we  leave in the communities where we  operate. These aspects form the true  measure of our success. We are also aligning our operations  and disclosures with respected  international frameworks including  the Science Based Targets initiative  (SBTi), the Global Cement and  Concrete Association (GCCA)  guidelines, and the Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD). This ensures that our actions  remain transparent, forward-looking,  and globally relevant.

Risk Management  Approach The Company’s risk management  process is comprehensive and  systematic, incorporating risk  mapping, environmental scanning,  and detailed assessments.  Risks are evaluated using a 3x3  matrix, categorising them into high,  medium, and low severity based on  their likelihood and impact. Each department plays a vital  role in this process, evaluating its  current and future risk landscape  while identifying both risks and  opportunities. These insights  are then consolidated into a  comprehensive risk profile, offering  an organisation-wide perspective. Ambuja Cements formulates  targeted mitigation strategies  for critical risks, ensuring  timely and effective responses.  Senior management closely monitors  the intensity of identified risks,  ensuring they are adequately  addressed. Throughout the process,  the Company maintains stringent  controls to ensure operational  efficiency, regulatory compliance,  and overall organisational resilience.

Risk Management  Risk Governance Ambuja Cements takes a proactive  approach to risk governance,  aligning risk management with its  defined appetite and tolerance.  Through a consistent and rigorous  risk assessment process, the  Company empowers management  to identify, evaluate, and mitigate  both internal and external risks,  ensuring regulatory compliance  and operational efficiency. Risk governance is central to  Ambuja’s strategy, enabling  data-driven decisions based on risk  ratings and the Company’s overall  risk appetite. Quarterly reports to  the Risk Management Committee,  led by the CEO and CFO, ensure  transparency and accountability. Adopting both top-down and  bottom-up approaches, Ambuja  consolidates insights into a  comprehensive risk view. The Risk  Management Committee oversees  the Enterprise Risk Management  (ERM) process, monitoring the  progress of mitigation actions.  By focusing on a maximum of  two critical risks per meeting, the  Committee ensures a targeted and  effective response, fostering agility  in addressing issues and driving  sustainable growth.   Risk Management   Committee (RMC) Ambuja Cements' comprehensive risk  management framework is overseen  by the Risk Management Committee,  comprising majority of Independent  Directors. The Committee monitors,  reports, and mitigates ongoing risks,  reviewing the Company’s governance  structure, risk assessment,  policies, practices and overall risk  management plan. Constituted in  line with the Companies Act, 2013,  the Committee directly reports  to the Board, assisting in the  fulfilment of its risk management  responsibilities. It is supported by  four sub-committees: Commodity Price Risk  Committee Reviews risks related to  commodity price fluctuations,  promotes risk awareness, and  manages the Commodity Price  Risk Management (CPRM)  policy, updating it based on  market conditions. Reputation Risk  Committee Assesses and addresses  risks to the Company’s  reputation, fostering a culture  of risk awareness and high  ethical standards. It ensures  potential conflicts of interest  and reputation risks are  promptly reported to the Risk  Management Committee. The Indian cement industry is highly  dynamic, with rapid changes and  industry consolidations that pose risks  to Ambuja's market position. These risks  are compounded by continuous  capacity expansions. The regulatory environment is evolving  rapidly, particularly with respect to  climate change and environmental  concerns. Failing to meet new  standards could significantly impact  the Company’s reputation and  financial stability. Health and safety are critical for  sustaining business operations and  ensuring the well-being of employees.  The Company's commitment to 'Zero  Harm' requires continuous evaluation  and improvement of safety measures  and leadership presence. Ambuja Cements is proactively addressing  these risks through its ambitious plan  to achieve 140 MTPA by FY 2027-28.  Recent capacity increases of approximately  20 MTPA have strengthened its market  presence. The Company also focuses on  brand enhancement through innovation and  digitisation to maintain competitiveness  and profitability. To mitigate regulatory risks, Ambuja Cements  is investing in modernisation and system  upgrades across its operations. The Company  is also addressing new emission standards  (for dust, SOx, and NOx) set by the Ministry  of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change,  ensuring compliance and positioning itself as  an environmentally responsible business. Ambuja Cements is actively working  to improve safety standards through  initiatives like Unchaai Kendra and the  implementation of Life-Saving Safety Rules.

Ensuring these projects are completed  on time, within budget, and with high  safety and quality standards is essential  for business growth. To secure natural resources, Ambuja is  investing in improving operational efficiency  and enhancing resource utilisation.  Initiatives like reducing the clinker factor and  increasing thermal substitution rates help  conserve resources. Additionally, the Company  is investing in renewable energy and Waste  Heat Recovery Systems to reduce reliance on  non-renewable sources and ensure long-term  sustainability. To ensure the availability of raw  materials, the Company is also investing in coal  and limestone mines. Ambuja Cements is mitigating energy price  risks by diversifying its fuel mix, increasing the  use of alternative fuels, and improving energy  efficiency across its operations. The Company  also evaluates various energy procurement  options to minimise reliance on fossil fuels  and ensure cost-effective, stable energy  supplies. By managing its energy resources, the  Company aims to sustain competitiveness in  the dynamic cement industry landscape. Ambuja leverages synergies with the Adani  Group's project management expertise to  execute large-scale projects efficiently.

Overview  Ambuja Cements' manufactured  capital encompasses the  physical assets that support  its operations, including  land, buildings, production  plants, leased mines,  machinery and equipment. Ambuja Cements’ Value Chain  Being one of the largest cement companies in India, Ambuja Cements goes above and beyond to ensure seamless  processes across its value chain to provide high quality cement. Raw Material    Sourcing   Raw Material    Preparation  Clinker    Production  Cement Grinding    and Blending Ambuja Cements  extracts essential raw  materials like limestone,  clay and laterite from  quarries. The Company’s  advanced mining  techniques ensure the  sustainable extraction  of these resources  while minimising  environmental impact.  Once extracted, the  raw materials are  crushed and grounded  into fine powder to  ensure homogeneity.  These materials  are then blended in  precise proportions  using automated  systems to achieve  the desired chemical  composition, forming  the foundation for  quality cement Ambuja  Cements produces. The blended raw    materials are fed into  rotary kilns, where they  are subjected to    extremely high  temperatures (1400– 1500°C) to form clinker,  the key intermediate  product in cement  manufacturing. To ensure  sustainability, Ambuja  Cements invests in  alternative fuels and  energy-efficient kilns  to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions and  energy consumption. The clinker is cooled and  mixed with gypsum and  other additives before  being finely ground in  advanced grinding mills.  This stage allows for the  production of different  types of cement, catering  to diverse consumer needs.

Human Capital De-risking Projects  The cement industry has seen significant  technological advancements over the  years, but it remains a labour- and  infrastructure-intensive sector with high  risk levels. Recognising this, the Company  decided to rethink how it approaches critical  processes with one simple question: "If the  risk is high, why should a human be involved?"  This mindset pushed Ambuja Cements  to explore innovative solutions beyond  traditional industry boundaries. With the  Group's openness to new approaches, the  Company introduced trials that are a first for  the Indian cement industry. The successful  ones are now being integrated into our  standard operating procedures.

Workers from  various states, including  Bihar, West Bengal, and  Uttar Pradesh, often  face acrophobia, or fear  of heights, which can  significantly impact their  ability to work safely.  Given that working at  height is a routine task  at the site, it was crucial  to assess the workers'  fear levels before they  began their duties.  The Vertigo Test involves  checking the worker's blood  pressure, pulse, and inner  ear function before and  after the test to ensure they  are fit for working at height.  If the worker passes the  test, they are then cleared  for Saksham training and  further medical tests.  This proactive measure has  helped mitigate risks and  prevent fatalities, ensuring  the safety and well-being of  workers at the Dahej plant.

Natural Capital production and supply chains.  Additionally, there is increasing  demand for reduced carbon  emissions in cement manufacturing.  To address these risks and ensure  business continuity, Ambuja  Cements has integrated climate  change risks into its comprehensive  Enterprise Risk Management  (ERM) strategy. A detailed Climate  Change Risk Assessment has  been conducted, covering short-,  medium-, and long-term timeframes.  Ambuja Cements Limited considers  both, physical risks caused by the  increased frequency and severity  of climate and weather events, and  transitional risks associated with  economic, technology or regulatory  changes. While these challenges  pose significant risks, they also  present opportunities for innovation,  sustainability leadership, and gaining  a competitive edge. Physical Risks  Ambuja Cements conducted  a comprehensive climate risk  assessment across all its sites,  evaluating physical risks such as  flooding, droughts, cyclones and  wildfires under IPCC scenarios  SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5.  Shared Socio-economic Pathways  (SSPs) is the latest set of emission  scenarios used in climate modelling.  This analysis provided the Company  with valuable insights into potential  List of Physical Risks Risk Category Risk Subcategory  Risk Description Acute Physical  Risks Chronic  Physical Risks Flood Pluvial Extreme Temperature Wildfire Cyclone Water Stress Excessive rainfall can result in pluvial flooding, causing substantial  damage and operational disruptions. Global warming, driven by climate change, has caused a wide array  of consequences. Rising temperatures worldwide have triggered  numerous far-reaching impacts. Temperature and precipitation patterns significantly influence  conditions that promote wildfires. Rising temperatures make  wildfire-prone regions warmer and drier, increasing the likelihood  of intense wildfires, which pose serious risks to assets and may  result in potential shutdowns. Over the past four decades, the frequency of intense cyclones  (Category 3 and above) has steadily increased. If this trend persists  with climate change, the heightened wind speeds of these storms  could pose severe threats to infrastructure and assets, potentially  causing catastrophic damage. Ongoing water scarcity can exacerbate climate change impacts,  leading to more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and  an elevated risk of wildfires. Reduced water availability may also  threaten food security, disrupt ecosystems and spark social unrest  as competition for this vital resource intensifies. impacts, enabling the development  of effective strategies to mitigate  risks associated with different  greenhouse gas emission pathways. Transition Risks Transition risks stem from the shift to a low-carbon business model, including regulatory, technological, and market  changes designed to meet climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. List of Transitional Risks Risk Category Risk Subcategory  Risk Description Transition  Risks Policy and Legal Technology Market The PAT scheme sets three-year energy-saving targets for  energy-intensive industries like cement production, enabling  the certification and trading of surplus savings, with financial  penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, Renewable Purchase  Obligations (RPO) mandate a minimum use of renewable energy,  and future policies may introduce carbon pricing mechanisms,  impacting operations and finances if targets are not met. The limited commercial viability of low-carbon technologies like  CCUS presents operational risks, as their implementation remains  costly and in the developmental phase. Additionally, the evolving  regulatory landscape and lack of clear commercial evidence  create uncertainty, further complicating their adoption and  impacting operations. Although captive limestone mines ensure a secure raw material  supply, rising costs of fuels like coal and coke pose financial risks.  These fuel price increases are influenced by changing climate  conditions, adding to the Company's operational vulnerabilities. Risk Mitigation Based on the Company's climate  risk assessment, none of its sites  currently face physical climate  risks. However, Ambuja Cements  is implementing site-specific  strategies to prepare for potential  future scenarios and minimise  the impact of unforeseen events  on operations.

Following types of wastes are  generated by the Company: •   Plastic Waste •   E-waste  •   Bio-medical Waste •   Construction and Demolition Waste •   Battery Waste  •   Other Hazardous Waste •   Non-hazardous Waste The Company is committed  to effective waste collection  and segregation at the source,  classifying materials as hazardous or  non-hazardous and storing them in  designated areas. 0.28  million tonnes   Total Wa ste Generated For more details of waste  generation, please refer to  BRSR, Principle 6, Question 9. Waste Management  The Company focuses on recycling  and co-processing of waste.  Some of the initiatives on waste  management are:  •   Plastic waste is mainly disposed  through in-house co-processing  and a minimal quantity such as  burst bags are dispposed through  authorised scrap dealers •   Bio-medical waste is disposed  through incineration at •   E-waste is recycled through  authorised recyclers •   Hazardous waste (used oil,  discarded drums) is reused at plant  or is co-processed in cement kiln  and the quantity which cannot be  co-processed is sent to common  authorised facility  •   Scrap is sold to authorised vendors •   Mining overburden is repurposed  and used for backfilling  within the mines Waste Disposal  E-waste, biomedical waste,  scrap and similar materials are  responsibly disposed of through  authorised recyclers accredited by  regulatory bodies. At many of its  plants, plastic waste and used oil  are co-processed in cement kilns,  preventing landfill disposal. Wastes  like fly-ash are recycled into  manufacturing of blended cement.  Zero  Hazardous Waste Sent to  Landfill Waste Derived Resources During the year, Ambuja utilised  20.88 million tonnes of waste- derived resources. This includes  0.57 million tonnes of alternate  fuels and 8.1 million tonnes of  waste derived raw materials like  fly-ash, gypsum and slag. Ambuja  has maintained cement quality  while conserving resources and  advancing its sustainability goals. 8.1   million tonnes  of Waste-derived Resources Utilised Biodiversity Management Biodiversity management is a key  focus in the Company's materiality  assessment, acknowledging  the role of healthy ecosystems  in mitigating natural disasters.  Robust biodiversity enhances  essential ecological services  vital for businesses and society.  ACL's comprehensive biodiversity  policy addresses operational impacts  by guiding the identification and  evaluation of biodiversity-related  risks across project sites and  implement a mitigation hierarchy of  avoid, minimise, restore and offset  and measure progress on regular  basis. The policy is applicable to  all operations and to suppliers and  value chain partners. The policy aims to No Net  Deforestation through time-bound  afforestation programmes. It aims to  achieve No Net Loss of Biodiversity  in all operations and at sites where  critical habitat is present with an  ultimate objective of achieving Net  Positive Gain of biodiversity. Ambuja Cements has undertaken  a comprehensive Nature Risk  Assessment, including a Biodiversity  Risk Assessment, based on the  Taskforce on Nature-related  Financial Disclosures (TNFD)  LEAP approach. This methodology  facilitates the identification,  evaluation, and reporting of  nature-related impacts and  dependencies. TNFD defines  dependencies as ecosystem services  essential for business operations,  such as a clean and consistent  water supply. Businesses also  have impacts—both positive and  negative—on environmental assets  and ecosystem services. These dependencies and  impacts create potential risks  for organisations. Physical risks  may arise due to climatic (e.g.  extreme weather events) or  geological (e.g. seismic activity)  factors, or through shifts in  ecosystem equilibrium, such as  soil degradation or marine ecology  changes. These risks may be  acute (event-driven), chronic, or  both. Transition risks stem from  an organisation’s misalignment  with evolving regulatory and  policy landscapes. Nature-related opportunities are  defined as activities that deliver  positive outcomes for businesses  and ecosystems by mitigating  negative impacts or contributing  to environmental restoration.  Cement production has a significant  dependency on natural capital,  particularly abiotic resources such  as minerals (e.g. limestone) and  water. Indirectly, the industry relies  on ecosystem regulation services,  including climate and water  regulation, as well as protection  against floods and storms.  However, mining activities required  for raw material extraction result  in land use changes, affecting  flora and fauna.

Natural Capital Risk Assessment Ambuja Cements conducted a  detailed mapping of its operations  within a 10 km radius of each  site to assess potential impacts  and dependencies on biodiversity  and ecosystem services. The IBBI  Ecosystem Services Matrix tool  was utilised for ecosystem service  mapping, and risk identification  was aligned with global standards,  including the International  Finance Corporation Performance  Standard 6, the UN Convention on  Biological Diversity’s Post-2020  Global Biodiversity Framework, the  Dow Jones Sustainability Index  (DJSI) and the TNFD Framework.  Additional tools such as DOPA, eBird  India and Global Mangrove Watch  were also employed. Following this assessment, a risk  categorisation matrix was developed  for each site, evaluating impact and  dependency. The study identified  sites as high-risk, medium-risk,  or low-risk, requiring varying  levels of intervention to mitigate  biodiversity-related risks. While none  of Ambuja Cements' sites were  classified as high-risk, the Nalagarh  and Sankraila Ropar sites were  identified as medium-risk.

Ambuja Cements Empowers Farmers with Biomass  Initiative   Ambuja Cements has empowered  farmers in over 100 villages  near its Marwar Mundwa plant  through a sustainable biomass  initiative. The Company’s CSR  efforts led to the formation of a  Farmer Producer Organisation  (FPO), enabling farmers within  150 km to supply biomass from  crop waste like mustard, fennel,  cumin, and Juliflora. Instead of burning crop waste,  which causes emissions, the FPO  helps farmers collect and sell it as  biomass for the Company’s plant  operations. Ambuja Cements  supports farmers with  agricultural inputs, market  access, and training on modern  farming techniques. Despite challenges like rainfall  dependency and market  competition, the initiative has  supplied over 52,201 MT of  biomass in FY 2024-25, improving  farmers' incomes and promoting  environmental sustainability. Agriculture employs over 70% of  India’s rural population, making  development in both farming and  non-farming sectors a critical focus  for sustainable community growth.  Ambuja Cements’ CSR initiatives  prioritise enhancing agricultural  livelihoods by promoting sustainable  practices and modern technologies.  Key efforts include raising  awareness and building farmers  capacity on crop diversification,  water-use efficiency and  introducing innovations such as  drone technology. Initiatives like  the Better Cotton Programme,  organic farming, and the System  of Rice Intensification aim to  reduce input costs and boost  crop productivity sustainably.  Additionally, animal husbandry and  other agricultural ventures provide  supplementary income to farmers.  The CSR team has promoted 16  farmer-producer organisations,  with 9,261 shareholders, including  33% women. The CSR team is also  advancing solar irrigation solutions,  offering cost-effective, eco-friendly  options and making unused land  productive.

Digitalising Contract Administration for    Enhanced Efficiency The Contract Administration  Department (CAD) plays a vital  role in managing contracts  across the cement industry,  dealing with agreements  from suppliers, customers and  stakeholders. Traditional contract  management, relying on manual  and paper-based systems, often  leads to inefficiencies, errors,  and a lack of transparency.  This has highlighted the need  for digitalisation to streamline  processes and improve accuracy,  compliance, and collaboration. Key initiatives include the  launch of vSPEED, an Electronic  Contract Management System  (ECMS) designed to centralise  contract storage and automate  workflows. vSPEED features  real-time tracking, automated  compliance checks, and change  order management, allowing  stakeholders to efficiently monitor  contract statuses, manage  changes and ensure compliance.  Its integration with ERP systems  enhances data accuracy and  facilitates smoother operations  across procurement, finance and  supply chain management. The benefits of digitalising  CAD processes are significant.  Automation of repetitive tasks  has reduced the turnaround time  for vendor invoice processing  from 15-20 days to just 5-7 days.  The system also minimises human  error, improving data accuracy and  document handling. Additionally,  enhanced transparency and  collaboration tools improve  communication across  departments, ensuring informed  and timely decision-making. The digital transformation also  optimises costs by reducing  reliance on physical storage  and manual labour, while better  compliance management helps  mitigate legal and regulatory  risks. Overall, digitalisation not  only increases efficiency and  accuracy but also strengthens  decision-making, maximising  business value and ROI.  By automating key aspects of  contract administration, CAD is  positioned to manage growing  contract volumes with greater  agility and effectiveness.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 190 191 Management Discussion and Analysis AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Cement Industry  As the world’s second-largest  cement producer, India plays a  crucial role in driving nation’s  infrastructure and construction  development. In FY 2024-25, the  market reached 440-445 million  tonnes, growing by 4.0% to 5.0%.  The first half of FY 2024-25 saw  modest growth of ~2%, wherein  the growth was largely impacted  due to Lok Sabha elections and an  intense heatwave, which slowed  construction activity and flattened  cement demand.  However, recovery began in  the second half, which was  driven by increased government  infrastructure spending and a  rise in housing and construction  activities post-monsoon.  The year also witnessed significant  expansion and mergers &  acquisitions, with major players  investing in new plants and  capacity additions, driven by  strong demand from housing,  infrastructure, and commercial  sectors, while continuing their  focus on green practices for  long-term growth.  In the Union Budget for FY  2025-26, the Indian government has  allocated a record  J  11.21 lakhs crore  (approximately USD 129.54 billion)  for infrastructure development,  reflecting its commitment  to modernising the nation’s  infrastructure. Key initiatives, such  as the  J  1 trillion Urban Challenge  Fund and  J  150 billion SWAMIH  Fund 2, are designed to drive urban  development and expedite housing  projects. Additionally, 1.5 trillion in  50-year interest-free loans to states  for capital investment is expected to  further spur cement demand. As urbanisation accelerates,  rising incomes and migration to  cities are fuelling demand for  housing, commercial spaces,  and infrastructure—directly  benefitting the cement industry.  The government’s push for Public  Private Partnership (PPP) projects  and ongoing infrastructure  investments signals strong future  growth prospects. With urban  development on the rise and a  robust policy framework in place, the  cement industry is well-positioned  for expansion, innovation, and a  central role in shaping India's modern  infrastructure. The Cement Manufacturers'  Association (CMA) remains  optimistic, anticipating a surge in  demand for construction materials  and significant capacity expansion  opportunities driven by the  government’s focus on large-scale  housing and infrastructure projects.

Global economic  growth was largely supported  by declining inflation and  easing of the monetary policies.  Global financial conditions were  largely accommodative, though  varied across geographies. The IMF  expects global economy to grow  by 3.3% during 2024, slightly lower  than 3.5% in 2023. India's economy has demonstrated  remarkable resilience and growth  over the past decade, with an  average annual expansion of  approximately 6%. This robust  performance has been driven by a  combination of factors, including  the implementation of various policy  reforms and sustained investments  by the Government of India. In FY 2024-25, India has experienced  significant developments that have  shaped its economic trajectory.  Disinflation and higher disposable  income aided urban demand  recovery, which led to increased  consumption. Additionally,  strong rural demand received a  further boost from the robust  performance of the agriculture  sector. GDP is expected to record  a moderate growth of 6.5%  for FY 2024-25. Outlook  The Economic Survey highlights  the need for systemic deregulation  to enhance India's long-term  growth prospects. Achieving the  vision of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047  requires a sustained 8% annual  growth rate. To make this vision  realistic, the government aims to  improve the business environment  under 'Ease of Doing Business  2.0' and support the SME sector's  growth. Both India and the  global economy are projected to  experience steady growth and  a continued decline in inflation,  supported by various economic  policies and reforms.  India's economy in FY 2025-26  is expected to moderately  grow by 6.5%, driven by robust  domestic demand, rise in urban  and private consumption, healthy  agriculture production, improved  infrastructure development,  and key reforms. However, trade  limitations along with global  geopolitical friction pose possible  risk to the economic outlook.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 218 219 Management Discussion and Analysis AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Strengthening Safety Excellence with STRAP   A Strategic Action Plan  Anchored in the 5C Principles In 2024, ACC made significant  strides in institutionalising safety  excellence across our operations  with the launch of STRAP —  Strategic Action Plan for Safety.  Anchored in the 5C Framework,  STRAP is a comprehensive  initiative that incorporates  Commitment, Capability Building,  Conformance, Culture, and  Communication. This strategic  plan is designed to create a  seamless, end-to-end safety  ecosystem, extending from driver  to drone, where every facet of our  operations is governed by shared  responsibility, proactive action, and  continuous improvement. 1. Commitment: Leading by  Example At the heart of STRAP lies  leadership commitment.  Safety is not simply a corporate  requirement but a core value  that is demonstrated from the  highest levels of the organisation.  Senior executives integrate  safety into their Key Performance  Indicators (KPIs), ensuring that  leadership is fully accountable  for the safety outcomes in their  respective areas. Visible Leadership: Regular safety  walkdowns, site visits, and safety  briefings ensure senior leaders are  actively engaged and demonstrate  safety leadership on the ground. Top-Down Ownership: Every level  of leadership, from plant managers  to board members, is responsible  for driving safety culture  and performance. By fostering a leadership culture  that prioritises safety in every  decision and action, we reinforce  our commitment to Zero Harm. 2. Capability Building:    Investing in People STRAP places a strong emphasis  on building capability at every level  of the organisation. To ensure that  our teams are not only compliant  but also competent and confident  in their ability to manage risks, we  have developed targeted training  and development programmes. Tailored Training: In 2024, we  rolled out specialised programmes  in critical areas like confined  space entry, energy isolation, and  working at heights. Modern Learning Tools: From  audio-visual modules to virtual  reality (VR) simulations, we  employed cutting-edge training  methods that cater to various  learning styles and roles. Drone Pilot Certification: We  have introduced drone safety  and operation training, equipping  our teams with the skills to use  aerial technology for inspections  and monitoring. On average, each full-time  employee (FTE) participated in  2.1 Mondays of safety training,  underscoring our dedication to  continuous improvement and  skill development. 3. Conformance: Systems and    Standards that Deliver Conformance to safety protocols is  a critical pillar of STRAP. We have  implemented a robust framework  that integrates safety standards,  audits, and real-time monitoring  tools into our daily operations,  ensuring that safety is adhered  to at all levels. Digital Safety Platforms: Real-time  permit-to-work systems, electronic  audits, and IoT-enabled vehicle  tracking help ensure compliance  and accountability. Standardised Protocols: Across  all locations, we use standardised  safety processes and systems, from  hazard assessments to incident  reporting, to ensure uniformity in  safety practices. By reinforcing the importance of  safety systems and aligning our  practices with global standards, we  maintain an unwavering focus on  risk mitigation. 4. Culture: From Compliance    to Ownership STRAP aims to cultivate a safety  culture where compliance evolves  into personal ownership. Our vision  is to foster an environment where  every individual is empowered to  contribute to the safety of their  worksite, making safety a natural  part of their daily routine. Peer-to-Peer Recognition:  Programmes like Safety  Heroes reward employees who  exhibit exceptional safety  leadership and encourage safe  behaviours among peers. We Care Initiative: This programme  encourages open discussions  around safety, supporting mental  well-being and enabling employees  to speak up without fear  of retribution. Behavioural Safety: We have  introduced behaviour-based  safety programmes where  individuals are actively engaged in  identifying risks and    taking preventive actions. Through a focus on cultural  transformation, we are shifting  from compliance-driven safety to  a culture where everyone takes  ownership of their own and their  colleague’s well-being. 5. Communication: Clarity,    Consistency, Connection Effective communication is  essential for the success of STRAP.  We ensure that safety messaging  is clear, consistent, and reaches  all corners of the organisation.  From leadership messages to  safety alerts, communication plays  a pivotal role in maintaining a  shared safety vision. Real-Time Safety Alerts: Our teams  are equipped with mobile apps  and digital signage to receive  immediate updates and reminders  about safety protocols. Daily Briefings: Every team  begins their shift with a toolbox  talk that aligns on key safety  priorities for the day. Multilingual Content: Safety  communications are made  accessible to a diverse workforce  through multilingual resources and  digital platform Top-down  Approach Bottom-up  Approach OH&S  Practitioners/Evangelists Line Champions OH&S    Coordinators Compliance    &   Behaviour Equipment & Facilities OH&S  System & Process Executive Leadership Senior Managers First Level Managers Workforce OH&S KEY DRIVERS INTEGRATED ORGANISATION   (LINE & SUPPORT) Ambuja Cements Safety Pyramid

Business Risks and  Opportunities Risks and Areas of Concern At Ambuja Cements (an Adani Group  company), Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)  is an annual process that identifies risks and  opportunities, and strengthens the Company’s  ability to build a sustainable business and  a robust risk intelligence ecosystem across  functions. The ERM process involves a  comprehensive assessment of the business  environment to identify and prioritise risks.  Risks and opportunities are evaluated using a  3x3 matrix based on severity (High, Medium,  Low) and probability. A functional approach is adopted, where  each department carefully assesses its  current and future operations to determine  potential business risks and opportunities.  These findings are then consolidated to  provide a Company-wide risk overview.  For critical risks, a mitigation plan is developed  and closely monitored by senior management  to ensure operational efficiency, regulatory  compliance, and business continuity. 

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 224 225 Management Discussion and Analysis AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Key Risks and Mitigation Measures Key Risks Description Mitigation Measures Market Volatility  The Indian cement industry is highly  susceptible to market volatility due  to economic fluctuations, demand- supply imbalances, and geo-political  changes. Factors such as shifts in  government policies, global trends, and  economic cycles can create short-term  uncertainties. Several future opportunities can help mitigate  these risks. The Indian economy holds immense  promise for infrastructure, construction, and  manufacturing, benefiting the cement industry.  The ‘Make in India‘ initiative is boosting the  manufacturing sector and transforming India  into a global manufacturing hub by improving  the ease of doing business, enhancing industrial  infrastructure, and fostering innovation.    A stable government with streamlined structures,  reforms, and infrastructure-promoting initiatives  will generate significant demand for the cement  industry.  Ambuja Cements continues to focus on  infrastructure and housing projects, ensuring  that economic and market growth creates new  opportunities. Customer-centric initiatives,  innovative products, and sustainable practices  help reduce its carbon footprint and preserve  natural resources. Its diverse product range,  including Ambuja Cement, Ambuja Plus, Ambuja  Kawach, Ambuja Compocem, supports sustainable  construction. Competitive    Environment India's cement industry is highly  competitive, with both large and small  players vying for market share. This  intense competition can lead to price  wars, margin pressures, and rapid  capacity additions, making it challenging  to maintain a strong market position. To address this challenge, Ambuja Cements  remains committed to bold business  transformation initiatives for long-term  sustainability. Since H2 2022, the Company’s  growth strategy has been a combination of  acquisitions and expansions, crossing 100 million  tonnes of cement capacity. Moving forward,  growth will be driven organically, with a target of  140 million tonnes by FY 2027-28. This strategy  will enhance overall capacity, increase market  share, and support its journey to becoming the  world’s lowest-cost producer of building materials  within five years. Environmental    Regulations Stricter environmental regulations  and compliance with domestic and  international standards pose reputational  and financial risks. Companies must  invest in cleaner technologies and  sustainable practices, which can be costly  but necessary. To comply with environmental regulations,  transformation, innovation, upgrades, and  modifications are continuously implemented.  Ambuja Cements is the world’s first cement  company to become signatory to the Alliance of  Industry Decarbonization (AFID)—   a global alliance accelerating the Net Zero  transition. With a bold target to achieve Net  Zero by 2050, the Company has committed  I  100  billion towards renewable energy projects and  Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS). Key Risks Description Mitigation Measures Sustainability –    Climate Change The cement industry is a significant  contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,  making it vulnerable to climate change- related risks. Companies must adopt  sustainable practices and reduce their  carbon footprint to mitigate these risks  and align with global climate goals. At the heart of Ambuja Cements’ operations is  the core philosophy of 'Growth with Goodness',  ensuring that its sustainability initiatives  contribute to decarbonisation and environmental  responsibility. The Company has committed to Net  Zero by 2050, with near-term targets validated  by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).  It is investing  I  100 billion in 1 GW of renewable  energy projects and 376 MW of WHRS capacity,  aiming to power 60% of its expanded operations  with green energy by FY 2027-28.  Ambuja Cements has made significant progress in  sustainability, utilising over 8.1 million tonnes of  waste-derived resources and achieving 12x water  positivity and 11x plastic negativity in FY 2024-25.  Additionally, our digital transformation initiatives  are enhancing operational efficiency and  delivering innovative, customer-centric solutions  in the construction sector. Cyber Security As businesses undergo digital  transformation, cybersecurity threats  pose risks to data integrity, network  security, and business continuity.  Protecting business information  systems is crucial. Ambuja Cements has  implemented advanced cyber security  solutions to safeguard its operations.  Adani’s ISO 27001-certified central cyber  defence and security operations centre  ensures enterprise-grade security. Cyber security is of paramount importance within  the organisation. The Company continuously  identifies and blocks data leakage sites, while also  establishing a secure and monitored environment  for AI tool usage.  To enhance security, backup procedures and  firewalls are in place, and systems are regularly  upgraded to meet the latest standards. Cyber  security policies are periodically updated, with  employees trained on compliance to mitigate risks  effectively. Health and Safety Ensuring occupational health and safety  is a top priority, as operational hazards  can impact employee well-being and  productivity. Ambuja Cements has implemented stringent  safety protocols and training programmes  to mitigate workplace hazards. Employees  undergo regular health check-ups and wellness  programmes to promote both physical and mental  well-being. A Scaffolding Inspector Training Programme  was conducted at Marwar and Nalagarh  plants by the Scaffold Training Institute (STI),  enhancing employees' safety, competency  and inspection skills. To further strengthen  workforce safety during annual shutdowns,  engineering controls have been introduced. The  WADI team has successfully developed a kiln  inlet dummy, preventing material dislodgement  and significantly reducing accident risks,  reinforcing Ambuja’s commitment to a safer work  environment.

These extreme  weather events can cause infrastructure  damage, may hinder the supply chain  network affecting timely delivery of raw  materials and finished products. It may  also cause power outages and affect the  manufacturing processes. Opportunity –  Energy cost is a major  cost in cement manufacturing. We  continuously strive to reduce our specific  thermal energy consumption and  specific electrical energy consumption  to optimise our energy costs. In addition,  it is directly related to carbon emissions  and by optimising energy consumption,  we can lower our carbon emissions. The Company has  approximately 78% of  products in its portfolio  which are blended  products with lower  carbon footprint. Further, we are investing  more and more in  renewal energy and  green energy from  WHRS. In addition, we  have set ambitious  targets for Thermal  Substitution Rates (TSR)  by using alternate fuels. Negative/ Positive 5. Biodiversity Risk and  Opportunity Risk –  Land disturbance and habitat  fragmentation from operational activities  can lead to biodiversity degradation.  Opportunity –  Restored ecosystems  can provide long-term environmental  benefits, including enhanced ecosystem  services such as water filtration, carbon  sequestration, and soil preservation.  These benefits not only contribute to  global environmental goals but also can  have positive economic implications for  the company and local communities in  the long run. We adhere to Indian  national regulations  and are a signatory  to the India Business  and Biodiversity  Initiative (IBBI) of the  Confederation of Indian  Industry (CII), and  Deutsche Gesellschaft  für Internationale  Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).  We assess the impacts  on biodiversity and  ecosystem services  through set KPIs. This  helps in conservation  of ecosystem. Negative/ Positive

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders Essential Indicators 1.   Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.     The successful involvement of our stakeholders is essential to the achievement of our strategic goals because  it provides us with the opportunity to understand their expectations, respond to their concerns, and assist us  in prioritising the areas in which we should be concentrating our efforts. Our mechanism for engaging with  stakeholders is governed by our Stakeholder Engagement Policy ( https://www.ambujacement.com/Upload/PDF/ Ambuja-Stakeholder-Engagement-policy-18-oct.pdf ), which is further aligned with global best practises.     Ambuja identifies its stakeholders as groups and individuals, who can influence or / are impacted by our  operations / activities, change in technology, regulations, market and societal trends either directly or indirectly.  Stakeholders comprise of communities, employees, supply chain partners, customers, investors, regulators, industrial  organisations etc.     Against each group, the potential ways in which stakeholders will be affected as well as the magnitude of both the  actual and perceived impacts have been determined. This assists the company in developing a bespoke plan for  engaging with stakeholders, which can then be kept up to date as and when is necessary.     Throughout the course of the year, we maintain ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders by utilising a variety of  channels of contact. The insights that we gain from these projects are tremendously helpful, because they allow us  to continually enhance both our strategy and our operations. The process of engaging stakeholders also includes  regular feedback and grievance redressal methods, both of which are vital components of the process. 2.

Revenue is measured at the  fair value of the consideration received, adjusted for  discounts, incentives, price concessions, rebates, and other  similar adjustments. The timing of revenue recognition,  the determination of when control is transferred,  and the assessment of unfulfilled obligations require  significant judgment, particularly given the complexity  of sales arrangements (including through Master Supply  Agreements (MSA)) and the varying terms and conditions  across different customer agreements. This complexity is  further compounded by the need to accurately estimate  and apply discounts, rebates, and other adjustments to  arrive at the fair value of consideration in the appropriate  period and the completeness of the expenses. The Company has established commercial policy that  sets benchmarks or limits for margins in case of MSA  with related parties and for discounts and rebates, within  which individual sales regions can design and implement  their own schemes. This decentralised approach allows  regional sales teams flexibility in offering rebates, which  may result in variations between regions in terms of the  level of discounts provided. Given the inherent complexity and judgment involved  in determining the timing of revenue recognition, the  assessment of control transfer, and the estimation  of discounts and rebates including cut offs, revenue  recognition has been identified as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included the following:    We have assessed the Company’s accounting policies  relating to recognition and measurement of revenue,  discounts, incentives and rebates by comparing with  applicable accounting standards.    We have evaluated the design and implementation of the  Company’s internal controls over revenue recognition,  including policies for discounts, rebates, and incentives,  ensuring alignment with Ind AS 115.    We have reviewed a sample of sales contracts, the  underlying documentation for discounts, incentives  and rebates recorded and disbursed during the year  to assess the timing of transfer of control has been  satisfied and verified delivery terms and conditions to  ensure revenue recognition aligns with the transfer of  control to customers.    We have tested accuracy and consistency of discounts,  rebates, and incentives applied to revenue transactions.  Assessed the reasonableness of management’s  estimates for measurement of variable considerations  including in case of MSA transaction with related  parties, contractual terms including historical trends  of payments and reversal of discounts, incentives  and rebated to provisions made to assess the  current year accruals.    Analysed regional schemes to ensure compliance  with the Company’s overall commercial policy and  benchmarks. Also, evaluated the impact of sales region  KPIs linked to revenue targets on the application of  discounts and rebates, ensuring no undue influence on  revenue recognition.

Litigation and claims (as described in Notes 3(H), 3.1(I) and 49 of the standalone financial statements) The Company has significant ongoing legal proceedings  for various matters relating to direct tax. indirect tax,  government incentive claims and other legal matters  relating to Company’s operations under various laws  prevailing in India. The Company has also deposited  substantial amounts against various matters or accounted  as receivable from authorities against dispute, which  has been classified as “Duty, taxes paid under protest  with Government Authorities against various disputes  – Other non-current assets” in Note 13. The provisions  made against legal matters have been included in Other  Payables - Other current liability” in Note 35. Due to the magnitude and complexity involved in these  matters, management's judgement regarding recognition.  measurement and disclosure of provisions for these legal  matters is inherently uncertain and might change over  time as the outcome of the legal cases are determined or  dispute gets settled. Accordingly, it has been considered  as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included the following:    Obtained and read the Company's accounting policies  with respect to contingent liabilities and provisions  and assessed its compliance with Ind AS 37 “Provisions,  Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets",    Obtained understanding of the Company's process and  controls to identify and monitor all litigations, Including  Company's process of assessment of litigations as  ‘probable', 'possible' and 'remote' and reporting to the  Board of Directors / Audit Committee.    Discussed with the management including the  person responsible for legal and compliance to  obtain an understanding of the matters involved and  development in these matters compared to previous  year. For significant direct and indirect tax matters and  government incentive claims including special incentive,  we assessed the management conclusion with the  support of internal specialists. For claims/matters  settled during the year based on the orders/management  assessment, we verified orders/management conclusion,  as appropriate and verified whether the claims/matters  settled were properly accounted for in the books.    Obtained and assessed management conclusion basis  the related documentation / correspondence and  opinions from external legal experts (where applicable)  for other significant legal matters, as provided by  the management. For incentive claims, reviewed  management assessment for likelihood of recoverability.    Obtained direct legal confirmations for significant  matters from external law firms handling such matters  to corroborate management conclusions.    Assessed the objectivity and competence of the  external legal experts / law firms and internal specialist  as referred above.    Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the  standalone financial statements.    Obtained necessary representations from  the management. Impairment assessment of material Investments in subsidiaries (as described in Notes 3(E), and 9 of the  standalone financial statements) The Company holds significant investments in subsidiaries  (including loans of INR 985.92 crores) amounting to INR  26,339.32 crores as at March 31, 2025. These investments  are accounted for at cost less allowance for impairment,  if any. The management assesses at least annually the  existence of impairment indicators of each shareholding  in such subsidiaries by reference to the requirements  under Ind AS 36. If such indicator exists, impairment loss  is determined and recognised in the standalone financial  statements in accordance with the accounting policies. With regards loans given to subsidiaries, including step  down subsidiaries, Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instrument’,  require the Company to provide for impairment of its  financial asset measured at amortised cost, if any, using  the expected credit loss (‘ECL’) approach. The processes and methodologies for assessing and  determining the recoverable amount of investments/  loans in subsidiaries are based on complex assumptions  and require use of significant managements judgment,  in particular with reference to forecast of future cash  flows relating to the period covered by the respective  subsidiary Company’s strategic business plan, normalised  cash flows assumed as a basis for terminal value, as well  as the long-term growth rates and discount rates applied  to such forecasted cash flows. Considering the significant level of management judgment  required in estimating the cash flows and the complexity  of the assumptions used, this matter has been identified  as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures in relation to impairment assessment  of Company’s investment in and loans to subsidiaries  included the following:    Obtained an understanding of the management policy  on assessment of impairment/ loans of investment in  subsidiaries and assumptions used by the management  including design and implementation of relevant key  controls. We have tested the design and operating  effectiveness of these controls.    Obtained and compared the carrying values of the  Company’s investment in its subsidiaries with their  respective net worth as per audited financial statements  for the year ended March 31, 2025.    For potential impairment indicators identified by  management for material investments in subsidiaries,  obtained and assessed the appropriateness of the  methodology used in the impairment model, the input  data and underlying assumptions used such as future  levels of operations, discount rate etc. and considered  historical performance vis-à-vis budgets for  respective subsidiaries.    Assessed the recoverable value by performing sensitivity  testing of key assumptions used, analysed and examined  the business plans approved along with assumptions  and estimates used by management and tested the  arithmetical accuracy of these models.    Compared the carrying value of the investments and  loans to subsidiaries with their respective net assets  value and earnings for the period.    Assessed the disclosure is in accordance with applicable  accounting standards and Schedule III to the Note 9 in  the standalone financial statements of the Company.

Other Information The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for  the other information. The other information comprises  the information included in the Annual report, but does  not include the accompanying standalone financial  statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the accompanying standalone financial  statements does not cover the other information and we  do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the accompanying  standalone financial statements, our responsibility is  to read the other information and, in doing so, consider  whether such other information is materially inconsistent  with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge  obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially  misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we  conclude that there is a material misstatement of this  other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Management and  Those Charged with Governance for the  Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the  matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to  the preparation of these standalone financial statements  that give a true and fair view of the financial position,  financial performance including other comprehensive  (loss) / income, cash flows and changes in equity of the  Company in accordance with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India, including the Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section  133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility  also includes maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; making judgments and estimates that are  reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,  that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the standalone  financial statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements,  management is responsible for assessing the Company’s  ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless management  either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Charged with Governance are also responsible for  overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the standalone financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes  our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the standalone financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or  the override of internal control.    Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing  our opinion on whether the Company has adequate  internal financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls.    Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management.    Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use  of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material  uncertainty exists related to events or conditions  that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s  ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude  that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to  draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related  disclosures in the standalone financial statements  or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our  opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may cause  the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the standalone financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the standalone financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.    Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding  the financial statements and other financial information  of the joint operation to express an opinion on the  standalone financial statements. We are responsible  for the direction, supervision and performance of the  audit of the financial statements of the components  which have been audited by us. For the joint operation  included in the standalone financial statements, which  have been audited by other auditor, such other auditor  remains responsible for the direction, supervision  and performance of the audits carried out by them.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of  most significance in the audit of the standalone financial  statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025  and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these  matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation  precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in  extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter  should not be communicated in our report because the  adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be  expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of  such communication. Other Matter We did not audit the financial statements and other  financial information, in respect of one joint operation,  whose financial statements include total assets of  H   0.85  crores as at March 31, 2025 and total revenues of Nil and  net cash inflows of  H   0.08 crores for the year ended on  that date. These financial statements and other financial  information of the said joint operation has been audited by  other auditor, whose financial statements, other financial  information and auditor's report has been furnished to us by  the Management. Our opinion on the standalone financial  statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and  disclosures included in respect of the joint operation and  our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the  Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid joint operation, is  based solely on the report of such other auditor.

(b)     The Company has not been sanctioned working capital limits in excess of Rs. five crores in aggregate from  banks or financial institutions during any point of time of the year on the basis of security of current assets.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under  Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the  Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements of ACC  Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in  conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial  statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management’s Responsibility for Internal  Financial Controls The Company’s Management is responsible for  establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based on the internal control over financial reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating  effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct  of its business, including adherence to the Company’s  policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention  and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required  under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company's internal financial controls with reference  to these standalone financial statements based on our  audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the  Standards on Auditing, as specified under section 143(10)  of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal  financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards  and the Guidance Note require that we comply with  ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal financial controls with reference to these  standalone financial statements was established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls with reference to these standalone financial  statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit  of internal financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements included obtaining an understanding  of internal financial controls with reference to these  standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that  a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the design and operating effectiveness of internal  control based on the assessed risk. The procedures  selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including  the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of  the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with  reference to these standalone financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With  Reference to these standalone Financial  Statements A company's internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements is a process designed  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles. A company's  internal financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements includes those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance  that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that  receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorisations of management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company's assets that could have a material effect on  the financial statements. Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s Report of Even Date on the Standalone Financial Statements of Ambuja  Cements Limited Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls With Reference to standalone  Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial  statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be  detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to standalone financial  statements to future periods are subject to the risk that  the internal financial control with reference to standalone  financial statements may become inadequate because of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance  with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,  adequate internal financial controls with reference  to standalone financial statements and such internal  financial controls with reference to standalone financial  statements were operating effectively as at March 31,  2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

The Company's principal activity is to manufacture  and market cement and cement related products.     These standalone financial statements are approved  for issue in accordance with the resolution of the  Board of Directors on April 29, 2025. 2.     Statement of compliance and basis of  preparation     The standalone financial statements have been  prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting  Standards (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’)  as notified the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to  time) and presentation requirements of Division II  of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS  compliant Schedule III) (as amended from time to  time) as applicable to the financial statements.     The standalone financial statements have been  prepared on going concern basis using historical  cost, except for the following assets and liabilities  which have been measured at fair value:   1)   Derivative financial instruments,   2)     Certain financial assets and liabilities measured  at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding  financial instruments), and,   3)    Defined Benefit Plan’s – Plan Assets  measured at fair value.     Standalone financial statements are presented  in INR ( H ) (Indian Rupees) which is the functional  currency, and all values are rounded off to two  decimals to the nearest crore as per the requirement  of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, except  where otherwise indicated.     The standalone financial statements provide  comparative information in respect of the previous  period. The accounting policies are applied  consistently to all the periods presented in the  standalone financial statements. 3.   Summary of Material accounting policies A.   Property, plant and equipment     Property, plant and equipment are stated at their  cost of acquisition / installation / construction net  of accumulated depreciation, and accumulated  impairment losses, if any, except freehold non-mining  land which is carried at cost less accumulated  impairment losses. The cost of acquisition is the cash  price equivalent paid at the recognition date which  is equivalent to the fair value of an asset acquired.     Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset's  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,  as appropriate, only when it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with the item will  flow to the Company and the cost of the item can  be measured reliably.     When significant parts of plant and equipment are  required to be replaced at intervals, the Company  depreciates them separately based on their specific  useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is  performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying  amount of the property, plant and equipment as a  replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.  All other repairs and maintenance are charged to  the statement of profit and loss during the reporting  period in which they are incurred.     The present value of the expected cost for the  decommissioning of an asset after its use is included  in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition  criteria for provisions are met.     Spares which meet the definition of property, plant  and equipment are capitalised as on the date of  acquisition. The corresponding old spares are  derecognised on such date with consequent impact  in the statement of profit and loss.     Property, plant and equipment which are not ready  for their intended use as on the balance sheet  date are disclosed as "Capital work-in-progress".  Directly attributable expenditure related to and  incurred during implementation of Capital projects  to get the assets ready for intended use and for a  qualifying assets is included under “Capital work-in- progress (including related inventories)”. The same  is allocated to the respective items of Property  Plant and Equipment on completion of construction  (development of projects). Capital work-in-progress  is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss,  if any. Such items are classified to the appropriate  category of property, plant and equipment when  completed and ready for their intended use.  Advances given towards acquisition / construction of  property, plant and equipment outstanding at each  balance sheet date are disclosed as Capital Advances  under "Other non-current assets".     Capital expenses incurred by the Company on  construction/development of certain assets which  are essential for production, supply of goods or for  the access to any existing Assets of the Company  are recognised as enabling Assets under Property,  plant and equipment.   Depreciation on property, plant, and equipment     The Company, based on technical assessment made  by technical expert and management estimate,  depreciates certain items of building, plant and  equipment over estimated useful lives which are  different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule  II to the Companies Act, 2013. The management  believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic  and reflect fair approximation of the period over  which the assets are likely to be used. Depreciation is  calculated using “Written down value method” for  assets related to Captive Power Plant and using  “Straight-line method” for other assets.     The Company identifies and depreciates cost of  each component / part of the asset separately, if the  component / part have a cost, which is significant to  the total cost of the asset and has a useful life that is  materially different from that of the remaining asset.     Depreciation on additions to property, plant and  equipment is provided on a pro-rata basis from the  date of acquisition, or installation, or construction,  when the asset is ready for intended use.     Depreciation on an item of property, plant and  equipment sold, discarded, demolished or scrapped,  is provided up to the date on which the said asset is  sold, discarded, demolished or scrapped.     Capitalised spares are depreciated over their own  estimated useful life or the estimated useful life of  the parent asset whichever is lower.     The Company reviews the residual value, useful lives  and depreciation method on each reporting date and,  if expectations differ from previous estimates, the  change is accounted for as a change in accounting  estimate on a prospective basis. The residual values,  useful lives and methods of depreciation of property,  plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial  year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.     In respect of an asset for which impairment loss,  if any, is recognised, depreciation is provided on  the revised carrying amount of the asset over its  remaining useful life.     Property, plant, and equipment, constructed by the  Company, but ownership of which vests with the  Government / Local authorities:   i.     Expenditure on Power lines is depreciated over  the period as permitted in the Electricity Supply  Act, 1948 / 2003 as applicable.   ii.     Expenditure on Marine structures is depreciated  over the period of the agreement.   iii.     Expenditure on roads constructed is depreciated  for the period ranging from 10 to 30 years.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   Estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: Assets Useful lives Land (freehold) No depreciation except on land with mineral reserves.  Cost of mineral reserves embedded in the cost of freehold mining  land is depreciated in proportion of actual quantity of minerals  extracted to the estimated quantity of extractable mineral reserves Leasehold mining land Amortised over the period of lease on a straight-line basis Buildings, roads and water works 3 – 60 years Plant and equipment 8 – 30 years Railway sidings and locomotives 8 – 15 years Furniture, office equipment and tools 3 – 10 years Vehicles 6 – 10 years  Ships 25 years     The useful life as estimated above is as per the prescribed useful life specified under Schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013 except for the following case: Particulars  Useful Life estimated by the management Useful Life as per Schedule II Plant and Equipment related to  Captive Power Plant 20 to 40 years 40 years     The Management believes that the useful lives as given above reflect fair approximation of the period over which  the assets are likely to be used.   Derecognition of property plant and equipment     An item of Property, Plant and Equipment and any  significant part initially recognised is derecognised  upon disposal or when no future economic benefits  are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss  arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as  the difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset  is derecognised. B.   Intangible assets     Intangible assets acquired separately are measured  on initial recognition at cost. Cost comprises the  purchase price (net of tax / duty credits availed  wherever applicable) and any directly attributable  cost of bringing the assets to its working condition  for its intended use. The cost of intangible assets  acquired in a business combination is their fair  value at the date of acquisition. Following initial  recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost  less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any.     The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as  either finite or indefinite.     Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over  the useful economic life and assessed for impairment  whenever there is an indication that the intangible  asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and  the amortisation method for an intangible asset  with a finite useful life are reviewed during each  reporting period. Changes in the expected useful  life or the expected pattern of consumption of  future economic benefits embodied in the asset  are considered to modify the amortisation period or  method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in  accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on  intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure  forms part of carrying value of another asset.     Stripping Cost - Stripping costs are allocated and  included as a component of the mine asset when they  represent significantly improved access to limestone,  provided all the following conditions are met:   a)     it is probable that the future economic  benefit associated with the stripping activity  will be realised.   b)     the component of the limestone body for which  access has been improved can be identified; and   c)     the costs relating to the stripping activity  associated with the improved access can be  reliably measured.   Derecognition of intangible assets     An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or  when no future economic benefits are expected  from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from  derecognition of an intangible asset, if any, are  measured as the difference between the net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and  are recognised in the statement of profit and loss  when the asset is derecognised.   Contract based Intangibles     The Company recognises contract-based intangible  asset when the economic benefit under the  contract starts flowing to the entity and control  over the intangible asset is established. Till the  time such economic benefits start flowing to entity,  it is disclosed under Other Non-current assets as  “Payment under Long-term supply arrangement”.  The Company reclassifies such balance to intangible  assets once the economic benefit start accruing  to the Company.     Contract based intangibles are initially recognised  at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition,  contract-based intangibles are carried at cost  less accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any.     The useful life of the contract-based intangibles  for purpose of its amortisation is considered to be  shorter of the period of contractual rights or period  over which entity expects to obtain economic  benefits from the asset. Further, at every reporting  date, the contract-based intangibles are also tested  for impairment in case of an indication that the  contract-based intangibles might be impaired.   Amortisation of intangible assets     A summary of the policies applied to the Company’s intangible assets are, as follows: Intangible assets Useful life Amortisation method used Water drawing rights Finite (10-30 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life  Computer software Finite (up to 5 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life Mining rights Finite (up to 90 years) Over the period of the respective mining agreement on  a straight-line basis Sponsorship Rights Finite (up to 5 years) Amortised based on occurrence of event Dealer Network Finite (up to 3 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life C.   Impairment of non-financial assets     The carrying amounts of other non-financial assets,  other than inventories and deferred tax assets are  reviewed at each balance sheet date if there is any  indication of impairment based on internal / external  factors. An impairment loss, if any, is recognised  in the statement of profit and loss wherever the  carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable  amount. The recoverable amount is the higher  of the asset's fair value less cost of disposal and  value in use. Recoverable amount is determined  for an individual asset, unless the asset does not  generate cash inflows that are largely independent  of those from other assets of or Group of assets.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash  flows are discounted to their present value using a  pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and risks  specific to the assets. In determining fair value less  costs of disposal, recent market transactions are  taken into account. If no such transactions can be  identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.  A previously recognised impairment loss, if any, is  reversed when there is an indication of reversal,  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 364 365 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 however, the carrying value after reversal is not  increased beyond the carrying value that would  have prevailed by charging usual depreciation /  amortisation if there was no impairment. D.   Inventories     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each  product to its present location and condition are  accounted for as follows:   I.     Raw materials, stores and spare parts, fuel  and packing material:       Cost includes purchase price, other costs  incurred in bringing the inventories to their  present location and condition, and includes  non-refundable taxes. Materials and other items  held for use in the production of inventories are  not written down below cost if the finished  products in which they will be incorporated are  expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is  determined on a moving weighted average basis.       The Company conducts regular reviews  of stores and spares inventory ageing to  identify slow-moving and non-moving items.  Inventories with limited movement and low  anticipated future utility are appropriately  provided. The Company applies established  provisioning norms to write down the value of  such inventories, based on the ageing analysis.   II.     Work-in-progress, finished goods and stock-in- trade:       Cost includes direct materials and labour and a  proportion of manufacturing overheads based  on normal operating capacity but excluding  borrowing costs. Cost of Stock-in-trade includes  cost of purchase and other cost incurred in  bringing the inventories to the present location  and condition. Cost is determined on a moving  weighted average basis.       Net realisable value is the estimated selling  price in the ordinary course of business, less  estimated costs of completion and estimated  costs necessary to make the sale. E.     Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint  ventures     Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint  ventures are accounted for at cost, net of impairment,  if any. Cost includes transaction cost which is  directly attributable to the cost of acquisition of  the investments. F.   Fair value measurement     The Company measures its financial instruments,  such as derivatives, government securities and  mutual funds at fair value at each balance sheet date.     The fair value measurement is based on the  presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or  transfer the liability takes place either:   a)     In the principal market for the asset or liability, or   b)     In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability.     The principal or the most advantageous market must  be accessible by the Company.     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. The Company uses valuation  techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances  and for which sufficient data are available to measure  fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable  inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.     All assets and liabilities for which fair value is  measured or disclosed in the financial statements  are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, based  on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair  value measurement as a whole.     External valuers are involved for valuation of  significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets  and financial liabilities and derivatives.     For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the  financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company  determines whether transfers have occurred between  levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation  (based on the lowest level input that is significant to  the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period.     All assets and liabilities for which fair value is  measured as disclosed in the financial statements  are categorised within the fair value hierarchy  described in Note 54. G.   Financial instruments     Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value with the exception of trade  receivables that do not contain a significant financing  component or for which the Company has applied the  practical expedient, the Company initially measures  a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case  of a financial asset not at fair value through profit  or loss, transaction costs Transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of  financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value  through the statement of profit and loss) are added  to or deducted from the fair value of the financial  assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial  recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable  to the acquisition of financial assets or financial  liabilities at fair value through the statement of profit  and loss are recognised immediately in the statement  of profit and loss.   I.   Financial assets   a)     Initial recognition and measurement of  financial assets       The Company recognises a financial asset in  its balance sheet when it becomes party to  the contractual provisions of the instrument.  All financial assets are recognised initially at  fair value, plus in the case of financial assets  not recorded at fair value through profit or loss,  transaction costs that are attributable to the  acquisition of the financial asset. All regular  way purchases or sales of financial assets are  recognised and derecognised on a trade date  basis, i.e., the date that the Company commits  to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way  purchases or sales are purchases or sales of  financial assets that require delivery of assets  within the time frame established by regulation  or convention in the marketplace.       The classification of financial assets at initial  recognition depends on the financial asset’s  contractual cash flow characteristics and the  Company’s business model for managing them.       Trade receivables that do not contain a  significant financing component or for  which the Company has applied the practical  expedient are measured at the transaction  price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the  accounting policies in Section (I) Revenue from  contracts with customers.   b)     Subsequent measurement of financial assets       All recognised financial assets are subsequently  measured in their entirety at either amortised  cost or fair value, depending on the classification  of the financial assets.       Classification and measurement of  Financial assets       For purposes of subsequent measurement,  financial assets are classified in the  following categories:       Financial assets measured at amortised cost       Financial assets that meet the following  conditions are subsequently measured at  amortised cost using effective interest method  ("EIR") (except for debt instruments that are  designated as at fair value through profit or loss  on initial recognition):    the asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets in order to  collect contractual cash flows; and    Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.       Amortised cost is calculated by taking  into account any discount or premium on  acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral  part of the EIR.       Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other  Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)       Financial assets that meet the criteria for initial  recognition at FVTOCI are remeasured at fair  value at the end of each reporting date through  other comprehensive income (OCI).

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Financial assets at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL)       Financial assets that do not meet the  amortised cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria are  measured at FVTPL.   c)   Derecognition of financial assets       A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of  a financial asset or part of a Company of similar  financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:     i.     The rights to receive cash flows from the  asset have expired, or     ii.     The Company has transferred its contractual  rights to receive cash flows from the  asset or has assumed an obligation to pay  the received cash flows in full without  material delay to a third party under a  ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a)  the Company has transferred substantially  all the risks and rewards of the asset, or  (b) the Company has neither transferred  nor retained substantially all the risks and  rewards of the asset, but has transferred  control of the asset.         On derecognition of a financial asset in  its entirety, the difference between the  asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the  consideration received and receivable and  the cumulative gain or loss that had been  recognised in other comprehensive income  and accumulated in equity is recognised  in the statement of profit and loss if such  gain or loss would have otherwise been  recognised in the statement of profit and  loss on disposal of that financial asset.   d)   Impairment of financial assets       The Company applies the expected credit  loss model for recognising impairment loss on  financial assets measured at amortised cost,  trade receivables and other contractual rights  to receive cash or other financial asset.       The Company measures the loss allowance for  a Trade Receivables and Contract Assets by  following ‘simplified approach’ at an amount  equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.  In case of other financial assets 12-month  ECL is used to provide for impairment loss and  where credit risk has increased significantly,  lifetime ECL is used.       The Company considers a financial asset in  default when contractual payments are 90  days past due. However, in certain cases, the  Company may also consider a financial asset  to be in default when internal or external  information indicates that the Company is  unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual  amounts in full before taking into account any  credit enhancements held by the Company.  A financial asset is written off when there is  no reasonable expectation of recovering the  contractual cash flows.   II.   Financial liabilities and equity instruments   a)   Financial liabilities     i.   Initial recognition and measurement         The Company recognises a financial liability  in its balance sheet when it becomes  party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument.The Company’s financial  liabilities majorly includes trade payables  and payable towards purchase of Property,  Plant and Equipment.         All financial liabilities are recognised initially  at fair value and, in the case of payables, net  of directly attributable transaction costs.         Financial liabilities are classified, at initial  recognition, as financial liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss or at amortised  cost as appropriate.     ii.     Subsequent measurement of financial  liabilities at amortised cost         Financial liabilities that are not held-for- trading and are not designated as at  FVTPL are measured at amortised cost  at the end of subsequent reporting  periods. The carrying amounts of financial  liabilities that are subsequently measured  at amortised cost are determined based on  the effective interest rate method.     iii.     Subsequent measurement of financial  liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL)         Financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss include financial liabilities  held for trading and financial liabilities  designated upon initial recognition as at  fair value through profit or loss.         Financial liabilities are classified as held  for trading if they are incurred for the  purpose of repurchasing in the near term.  This category also includes derivative  financial instruments entered into by the  Company that are not designated as hedging  instruments in hedge relationships as  defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded  derivatives are also classified as held for  trading unless they are designated as  effective hedging instruments.         Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading  are recognised in the statement of profit  and loss account.         Financial liabilities designated upon initial  recognition at fair value through profit or  loss are designated as such at the initial  date of recognition, and only if the criteria  in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.     iv.   Derecognition of financial liabilities         A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged  or cancelled or expired. When an existing  financial liability is replaced by another  from the same lender on substantially  different terms, or the terms of an existing  liability are substantially modified, such  an exchange or modification is treated as  the derecognition of the original liability  and the recognition of a new liability.  The difference in the respective carrying  amounts is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.   III.   Offsetting of financial instruments       Financial assets and financial liabilities are  offset, and the net amount is reported in the  balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable  legal right to offset the recognised amounts and  there is an intention to settle on a net basis,  to realise the assets and settle the liabilities  simultaneously. H.   Provisions and contingencies   I.   Provisions    Mines  reclamation       The Company provides for the costs of restoring  a mine where a legal or constructive obligation  exists. The estimated future costs for known  restoration requirements are determined on a  mine-by-mine basis and are calculated based  on the present value of estimated future  cash out flows.       The restoration provision before exploitation of  the raw materials has commenced is included in  Property, Plant and Equipment and depreciated  over the life of the related asset.       The effect of any adjustments to the provision  due to further environmental damage as a result  of exploitation activities is recorded through  the Statement of Profit and Loss over the life  of the related asset, in order to reflect the best  estimate of the expenditure required to settle  the obligation at the end of the reporting period.       Changes in the measurement of a provision that  result from changes in the estimated timing or  amount of cash outflows, or a change in the  discount rate, are added to or deducted from the  cost of the related asset to the extent that they  relate to the asset’s installation, construction  or acquisition.       Provisions are discounted to their present value.  The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a  finance cost in the Statement of Profit and Loss.    Other  provisions:       Provisions are recognised when the Company  has a present obligation (legal or constructive)  as a result of a past event, it is probable that  an outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation  and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of the obligation. When the Company  expects some or all of a provision to be  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 368 369 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 reimbursed, for example, under an insurance  contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a  separate asset, but only when the reimbursement  is virtually certain. The expense relating to a  provision is presented in the statement of profit  and loss net of any reimbursement.   II.   Contingent liability       A contingent liability is a possible obligation  that arises from the past events whose  existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or  non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future  events beyond the control of the Company  or a present obligation that arises from past  events and that is not recognised because it  is not probable that an outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits will be required  to settle the obligation. The Company does not  recognise a contingent liability but discloses its  existence in the financial statements. I.   Revenue recognition     Revenue is recognised on the basis of approved  contracts regarding the transfer of goods or  services to a customer for an amount that reflects  the consideration to which the entity expects to be  entitled in exchange of those goods or services.   I.   Sale of goods       Revenue from the sale of the goods is recognised  when delivery has taken place and control of  the goods has been transferred to the customer  according to the specific delivery term that have  been agreed with the customer and when there  are no longer any unfulfilled obligations.       Revenue is measured after deduction of any  discounts, price concessions, volume rebates  and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of  the government such as goods and services tax,  etc. The Company accrues for such discounts,  price concessions and rebates at inception  to determine the transaction price based on  historical experience and specific contractual  terms with the customer.       The disclosure of significant accounting  judgements, estimates and assumptions relating  to revenue from contracts with customers are  provided in Note 3.1 (VI).       No element of financing is deemed present as the  sales are made with credit terms largely ranging  between 30 days and 60 days depending on the  specific terms agreed with customers.   II.   Rendering of services       Income from services rendered is recognised  at a point in time based on agreements /  arrangements with the customers when the  services are performed and there are no  unfulfilled obligations.   III.     Contract assets, Trade receivables and  Contract liabilities:    Contract  asset:       A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Company performs by  transferring goods or services to a customer  before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that  is conditional. Contract assets are subject to  impairment assessment.    Trade  receivables       A receivable represents the Company’s right to  an amount of consideration that is unconditional  i.e., only the passage of time is required before  payment of consideration is due and the  amount is billable.    Contract  liabilities       A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which the  Company has received consideration from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised  as revenue when the Company performs  obligations under the contract.     Rebates to customers (Refund liabilities)       Rebates to customers is recognised for the  credit under various schemes including  expected future rebates that are expected to  be claimed by the customers. The Company  updates its estimates of rebates at the end  of each reporting period. The Company does  not have material sales return and hence, no  liabilities are recognised towards the sales at  reporting date.   IV.   Interest income       Interest income from a financial asset is  recognised when it is probable that the  economic benefits will flow to the Company and  the amount of income can be measured reliably.  Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by  reference to the principal outstanding and at  the effective interest rate applicable, which  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash receipts through the expected life  of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying  amount on initial recognition.   V.   Dividends       Dividend income is recognised when right  to receive is established (provided that it is  probable that the economic benefits will flow  to the Company and the amount of income can  be measured reliably). J.   Retirement and other employee benefits   I.   Defined contribution plan       Employee benefits in the form of contribution  to Superannuation Fund, Provident Fund  managed by government authorities (EPFO),  Employees State Insurance Corporation and  Labour Welfare Fund are considered as defined  contribution plans and the same are charged to  the statement of profit and loss for the year in  which the employee renders the related service.   II.   Defined benefit plan       The Company's gratuity fund scheme, additional  gratuity scheme and post-employment benefit  scheme are considered as defined benefit  plans. The Company's liability is determined  on the basis of an actuarial valuation using  the projected unit credit method as at the  balance sheet date.       Employee benefit in respect of certain categories  of employees, are provided in the form of  contribution to provident fund managed by a  trust set up by the Company till December 31,  2024, is charged to statement of profit and loss  for the year in which the employee renders the  related service. The Company has an obligation  to make good the shortfall, if any, between the  return from the investment of the trust and  interest rate notified by the Government of  India till December 31, 2024. Such shortfall is  recognised in the statement of profit and loss  based on actuarial valuation. W.e.f. January 01,  2025, such categories of employee benefit  has also been included in defined employee  contribution plan as stated above.       Past service costs are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss on the earlier of:     a)     The date of the plan amendment or  curtailment, and     b)     The date that the Company recognises  related restructuring costs       The net interest cost is calculated by applying  the discount rate to the net balance of the  defined benefit obligation and the fair value  of plan assets. The Company recognises the  following changes in the net defined benefit  obligation as an expense in the statement of  profit and loss:     a)     Service costs comprising current service  costs, past-service costs, gains and  losses on curtailments and non-routine  settlements; and     b)   Net interest expense or income     c)     Re-measurements, comprising actuarial  gains and losses, the effect of the asset  ceiling (if any), and the return on plan assets  (excluding net interest), are recognised  immediately in the balance sheet with a  corresponding debit or credit to retained  earnings through OCI in the period in which  they occur. Re-measurements are not  reclassified to the statement of profit and  loss in subsequent periods.   III.   Short-term employee benefits       Short-term employee benefits that are expected  to be settled wholly within 12 months after the  end of the period in which the employees render  the related service are recognised as an expense  at the undiscounted amount in the statement of  profit and loss of the year in which the related  service is rendered.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Accumulated compensated absences, which  are expected to be settled wholly within 12  months after the end of the period in which the  employees render the related service, are treated  as short-term employee benefits. The Company  measures the expected cost of such absences  as the additional amount that it expects to pay  as a result of the unused entitlement that has  accumulated at the reporting date.   IV.   Other long-term employee benefits       Compensated absences are provided for on  the basis of an actuarial valuation, using the  projected unit credit method, as at the date of  the balance sheet. Actuarial gains / losses, if any,  are immediately recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.       Long service awards and accumulated  compensated absences which are not expected  to be settled wholly within 12 months after the  end of the period in which the employees render  the related service are treated as other long-term  employee benefits for measurement purposes.   V.   Termination benefits       Termination benefits are payable when  employment is terminated by the Company  before the normal retirement date, or when  an employee accepts voluntary redundancy  in exchange for these benefits. The Company  recognises termination benefits at the earlier  of the following:     a)     when the Company can no longer withdraw  the offer of those benefits;     b)     when the Company recognises costs for  a restructuring that is within the scope  of Ind AS 37 and involves the payment of  termination benefits.         In the case of an offer made to encourage  voluntary redundancy, the termination  benefits are measured based on the number  of employees expected to accept the offer.  Benefits falling due more than 12 months  after the end of the reporting period are  discounted to present value.   VI.   Presentation and disclosure       For the purpose of presentation of defined  benefit plans, the allocation between the  short-term and long-term provisions have  been made as determined by an actuary.  Obligations under other long-term benefits  are classified as short-term provision, if the  Company does not have an unconditional right  to defer the settlement of the obligation beyond  12 months from the reporting date. The Company  presents the entire compensated absences as  short-term provisions since employee has an  unconditional right to avail the leave at any time  during the year. K.   Taxation     Tax expense comprises current income tax and  deferred income tax and includes any adjustments  related to past periods in current and / or deferred  tax adjustments that may become necessary due  to certain developments or reviews during the  relevant period.   I.   Current income tax       Current income tax assets and liabilities  are measured at the amount expected to  be recovered from or paid to the taxation  authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to  compute the amount are those that are enacted  or substantively enacted, at the reporting date  in the countries where the Company operates  and generates taxable income.       Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside the statement of profit and loss is  recognised in correlation to the underlying  transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.  Management periodically evaluates positions  taken in the tax returns with respect to  situations in which applicable tax regulations  are subject to interpretation and recognise  expense where appropriate.       Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are  offset when there is a legally enforceable right  to set off the recognised amounts and there is  an intention to settle the asset and the liability  on a net basis.   II.   Deferred tax       Deferred tax is recognised for the future  tax consequences of deductible temporary  differences between the carrying values of  assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases at the reporting date.       Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all  taxable temporary differences, except:    When the deferred tax liability arises from  the initial recognition of goodwill or an  asset or liability in a transaction that is  not a business combination and, at the  time of the transaction, affects neither the  accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss  and does not give rise to equal taxable and  deductible temporary differences    In respect of taxable temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures,  when the timing of the reversal of the  temporary differences can be controlled and  it is probable that the temporary differences  will not reverse in the foreseeable future.         Deferred tax assets are recognised for  all deductible temporary differences, the  carry forward of unused tax credits and  any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets  are recognised only to the extent that it  is probable that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which such  deferred tax assets can be realised, except:    When the deferred tax asset relating to  the deductible temporary difference arises  from the initial recognition of an asset  or liability in a transaction that is not a  business combination and, at the time  of the transaction, affects neither the  accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.    In respect of deductible temporary  differences associated with investments  in subsidiaries, associates and interests  in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are  recognised only to the extent that it is  probable that the temporary differences  will reverse in the foreseeable future and  taxable profit will be available against which  the temporary differences can be utilised.       The carrying amount of deferred tax assets  are reviewed at each balance sheet date.  The Company writes-down the carrying amount  of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which deferred  tax asset can be realised. Any such write-down  is reversed to the extent that it becomes  reasonably certain that sufficient future taxable  income will be available.       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  based on the tax rates that are expected to  apply in the year when the asset is realised or  the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax  laws) that have been enacted or substantively  enacted at the reporting date.       Deferred tax relating to items recognised  outside the statement of profit and loss is  recognised outside profit or loss (either in  other comprehensive income or in equity).  Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation  to the underlying transaction either in OCI or  directly in equity.       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset  when there is a legally enforceable right to  offset current tax assets and liabilities and  when the deferred tax balances relate to the  same taxation authority.       The Company applies significant judgment  in identifying uncertainties over income tax  treatments. Uncertain tax positions are reflected  in the overall measurement of the Company’s tax  expense and are based on the most likely amount  or expected value that is to be disallowed by the  taxing authorities whichever better predict the  resolution of uncertainty. Uncertain tax balances  are monitored and updated as and when new  information becomes available, typically upon  examination or action by the taxing authorities  or through statute expiration.       In the situations where one or more units of  the Company are entitled to a tax holiday under  the tax law, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is  recognised in respect of temporary differences  which reverse during the tax holiday period,  to the extent the concerned unit’s gross total  income is subject to the deduction during the  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 372 373 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 tax holiday period. Deferred tax in respect of  temporary differences which reverse after the  tax holiday period is recognised in the year in  which the temporary differences originate.  However, the Company restricts recognition of  deferred tax assets to the extent it is probable  that sufficient future taxable income will be  available against which such deferred tax assets  can be realised. For recognition of deferred  taxes, the temporary differences which originate  first are considered to reverse first. L.   Leases     The Company assesses whether a contract is or  contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract  is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the  right to control the use of an identified asset for a  period of time in exchange for consideration.   I.   Company as a lessee:    Right-of-use  assets       At the date of commencement of the lease,  the Company recognises a right-of-use asset  and a corresponding lease liability for all lease  arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for  short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.       The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at  cost, which comprises the initial amount of the  lease liability adjusted for any lease payments  made at or prior to the commencement date  of the lease plus any initial direct costs less  any lease incentives. They are subsequently  measured at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses, if any.  Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the  commencement date on a straight-line basis  over the shorter of the lease term and useful  life of the underlying asset: Right-of-use assets Terms (in years) Buildings 2-30 Leasehold land 5-99 Ships and tugs 2-13 Vehicles 5       The right-of-use assets is also subject to  impairment. Right-of-use assets are evaluated  for recoverability whenever events or changes  in circumstances indicate that their carrying  amounts may not be recoverable.    Lease  liabilities       Lease liability is initially measured at the  present value of the future lease payments.  The lease payments are discounted using the  interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily  determinable, using the incremental borrowing  rates. The Company uses the incremental  borrowing rate as the discount rate.       Lease payments included in the measurement  of the lease liability include fixed payments,  variable lease payments that depend on an index  or a rate known at the commencement date; and  extension option payments or purchase options  payments which the Company is reasonably  certain to exercise.       Variable lease payments that do not depend  on an index or rate are not included in the  measurement the lease liability and the ROU  asset. The related payments are recognised as  an expense in the period in which the event or  condition that triggers those payments occurs  and are included in the line “Other expenses” in  the Statement of Profit or Loss.       The lease term comprises the non-cancellable  lease term together with the period covered  by extension options, if assessed as reasonably  certain to be exercised, and termination options,  if assessed as reasonably certain not to be  exercised. For lease arrangement in respect  of ships, the non-lease components are not  separated from lease components and instead  account for each lease component, and any  associated non-lease component as a single  lease component.       The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by  increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest  on the lease liabilities, reducing the carrying  amount to reflect the lease payments made.       ROU asset and lease liabilities have been  separately presented in the Balance Sheet  and lease payments have been classified as  financing cash flows.       Short-term leases and leases of low-value  assets       The Company applies the short-term lease  recognition exemption to its short-term leases  (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12  months or less from the commencement date).       It also applies the low-value asset recognition  exemption on a lease-by-lease basis, if the lease  qualifies as leases of low-value assets. In making  this assessment, the Company also factors  below key aspects:     a)     The assessment is conducted on an  absolute basis and is independent of the  size, nature, or circumstances of the lessee.     b)     The assessment is based on the value of the  asset when new, regardless of the asset's  age at the time of the lease.     c)     The lessee can benefit from the use of  the underlying asset either independently  or in combination with other readily  available resources, and the asset is  not highly dependent on or interrelated  with other assets.     d)     If the asset is subleased or expected to be  subleased, the head lease does not qualify  as a lease of a low-value asset.         Lease payments on short-term leases and  leases of low-value assets are recognised  as expense on a straight-line basis over  the lease term. The related cash flows are  classified as Operating activities in the  Statement of Cash Flows.   II.   Company as a lessor:       The determination of whether an arrangement is  (or contains) a lease is based on the substance  of the arrangement at the inception of the  lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease  if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent  on the use of a specific asset or assets and the  arrangement conveys a right to use the asset  or assets, even if that right is not explicitly  specified in an arrangement. Leases are  classified as finance leases whenever the terms  of the lease transfer substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  All other leases are classified as operating  leases. Rental income from operating leases  is generally recognised on a straight-line basis  over the term of the relevant lease. Where the  rentals are structured solely to increase in line  with expected general inflation to compensate  for the Company's expected inflationary cost  increases, such increases are recognised in the  year in which such benefits accrue. Initial direct  costs incurred in negotiating and arranging  an operating lease are added to the carrying  amount of the leased asset and recognised on  a straight-line basis over the lease. M.    Government grants and subsidies including  duty credits/refunds     Government grants are recognised at their fair value  when there is a reasonable assurance that the grant  will be received, and all attached conditions will  be complied with.     Where the grants relate to an item of expense, they  are recognised as income on a systematic basis in  the statement of profit and loss over the periods  necessary to match them with the related costs,  which they are intended to compensate.     Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised  as income in equal amounts over the expected useful  life of the related asset.     When the Company receives grants of non-monetary  assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair  value amounts and released to the statement of profit  and loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of  consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset.     When loans or similar assistance are provided by  governments or related institutions, with an interest  rate below the current applicable market rate, the  effect of this favourable interest is regarded as a  government grant. The loan or assistance is initially  recognised and measured at fair value and the  government grant is measured as the difference  between the initial carrying value of the loan and  the proceeds received. The loan is subsequently  measured as per the accounting policy applicable to  financial liabilities.     Government grant receivables are discounted to  their present value. If the effect of the time value  of money is material, Government grant receivables  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 374 375 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that  reflects current market assessments of the time  value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  When discounting is used, the increase in the  receivable due to the passage of time is recognised  as a component of “Government grant including duty  credits/refunds. N.   Earnings per share     Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the  net profit or loss attributable to equity holders of  parent company by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the period.     Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing  the profit after tax as adjusted for dividend, interest  and other charges to expense or income (net of any  attributable taxes) relating to the dilutive potential  equity shares, by the weighted average number of  equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings  per share and the weighted average number of equity  shares which could have been issued on conversion  of all dilutive potential equity shares. O.   Foreign currencies translations     The Company’s standalone financial statements  are presented in ( H ), which is also the Company’s  functional currency.     Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in  foreign currencies are translated at the functional  currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting  date. Exchange differences on monetary items  are recognised in profit and loss in the period in  which they arise.     Non-monetary items which are carried in terms of  historical cost denominated in a foreign currency  are reported using the exchange rate at the date of  the transaction. P.   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and for  the purpose of standalone statement of cash flows  comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term  deposits with an original maturity of three months  or less and investment in liquid mutual funds that are  readily convertible to a known amount of cash and  subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Q.   Dividend     The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend  to equity holders of the parent when the distribution  is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at  the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate  laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it  is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding  amount is recognised directly in equity. R.     Classification of current and non-current assets  and liabilities     The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition  of assets for processing and their realisation in cash  and cash equivalents. The Company has identified  twelve months as its operating cycle for determining  current and non-current classification of assets and  liabilities in the Balance sheet. S.   Exceptional Items     Exceptional items refer to items of income or  expense, within the statement of profit and loss from  ordinary activities which are non-recurring and are  of such size, nature or incidence that their separate  disclosure is considered necessary to explain the  performance of the Company. 3.1   Use of estimates and judgements     The preparation of the Company’s financial  statements requires management to make  judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets  and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures,  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.  Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates  could result in outcomes that require a material  adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or  liabilities affected in future periods.     Estimates and judgements are continually  evaluated and are based on historical experience  and other factors, including expectations of future  events that are believed to be reasonable under  the circumstances.     The estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to  accounting estimates are recognised in the period  in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects  only that period, or in the period of the revision and  future period, if the revision affects current and  future period. Revisions in estimates are reflected  in the financial statements in the period in which  changes are made and, if material, their effects are  disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.     The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  are described below. Existing circumstances and  assumptions about future developments may change  due to market changes or circumstances arising that  are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes  are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.   I.     Classification of legal matters and tax  litigations (Refer Note 49)       The litigations and claims to which the Company  is exposed to are assessed by management with  assistance of the legal department and in certain  cases with the support of external specialised  lawyers. Determination of the outcome of  these matters into “Probable, Possible and  Remote” require judgement and estimation on  case to case basis.   II.   Defined benefit obligations (Refer Note 51)       The cost of defined benefit gratuity plans, and  post-retirement medical benefit is determined  using actuarial valuations. The actuarial  valuation involves making assumptions about  discount rates, future salary increases, mortality  rates and future pension increases. Due to the  long-term nature of these plans, such estimates  are subject to significant uncertainty.   III.     Useful life of property, plant and equipment  (Refer Note 4)       The charge in respect of periodic depreciation  is derived after determining an estimate of an  asset's expected useful life and the expected  residual value. Increasing an asset's expected  life or its residual value would result in a reduced  depreciation charge in the statement of profit  and loss. The useful lives of the Company's  assets are determined by management at the  time the asset is acquired and reviewed at least  annually for appropriateness. The lives are based  on historical experience with similar assets as  well as anticipation of future events, which may  impact their life, such as changes in technology.   IV.    Impairment of Property, plant and  equipment (Refer Note 4)       Determining whether the property, plant and  equipment are impaired requires an estimate of  the value of use. In considering the value in use,  the management has anticipated the capacity  utilisation of plants, operating margins, mineable  resources and availability of infrastructure  of mines, and other factors of the underlying  businesses / operations. Any subsequent  changes to the cash flows due to changes in  the above-mentioned factors could impact the  carrying value of property, plant and equipment.   V.     Incentives under the State Industrial Policy  (Refer Note 12 and 20)       The Company’s manufacturing units in various  states are eligible for incentives under the  respective State Industrial Policy. The Company  accrues these incentives as refund claims  in respect of VAT/GST paid, on the basis that  all attaching conditions were fulfilled by the  Company and there is reasonable assurance  that the incentive claims will be disbursed by  the State Governments.       The Company measures expected credit losses  in a way that reflects the time value of money.  Any subsequent changes to the estimated  recovery period could impact the carrying value  of Incentives receivable.   VI.    Discounts / rebate to customers (Refer  Note 37)       The Company provides discount and rebates  on sales to certain customers. Revenue from  these sales is recognised based on the price  charged to the customer, net of the estimated  pricing allowances, discounts, rebates, and  other incentives. In certain cases, the amount of  these discount and rebates are not determined  until claims with appropriate evidence is  presented by the customer to the Company,  which may be some time after the date of  sale. Accordingly, the Company estimates the  amount of such incentives basis the terms  of contract, incentive schemes, historical  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 376 377 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements as at March 31, 2025 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 experience adjusted with the forward-looking,  business forecast and the current economic  conditions. To estimate the amount of  incentives, the Company uses the most likely  method. Such estimates are subject to the  estimation uncertainty. VII.     Physical verification of Inventory (Refer    Note 14)       Bulk inventory for the Company primarily  comprises of coal, petcoke and clinker which are  primarily used during the production process at  the manufacturing locations. Determination of  physical quantities of bulk inventories is done  based on volumetric measurements and involves  special considerations with respect to physical  measurement, density calculation, moisture,  etc. which involve estimates / judgements. VIII.     For key estimates and judgements related to  fair values Refer Note 55. 3.2   New and Amended Standards:     The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notified the  Ind AS 117, Insurance Contracts, vide notification  dated 12 August 2024, under the  Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2024 ,  which is effective from annual reporting periods  beginning on or after 1 April 2024.   i.     Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts is a  comprehensive new accounting standard for  insurance contracts covering recognition and  measurement, presentation and disclosure.  Ind AS 117 replaces Ind AS 104 Insurance  Contracts. Ind AS 117 applies to all types of  insurance contracts, regardless of the type of  entities that issue them as well as to certain  guarantees and financial instruments with  discretionary participation features; a few scope  exceptions will apply. Ind AS 117 is based on a  general model, supplemented by:     A specific adaptation for contracts  with direct participation features (the  variable fee approach)    A simplified approach (the premium  allocation approach) mainly for  short-duration contracts       The application of Ind AS 117 does not have  material impact on the Company’s separate  financial statements as the Company has not  entered any contracts in the nature of insurance  contracts covered under Ind AS 117.   ii.     Amendments to Ind AS 116 Leases – Lease  Liability in a Sale and Leaseback       The MCA notified the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Second Amendment  Rules, 2024, which amend Ind AS 116,  Leases, with respect to Lease Liability in a  Sale and Leaseback.       The amendment specifies the requirements  that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the  lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback  transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does not  recognise any amount of the gain or loss that  relates to the right-of-use it retains.       The amendment is effective for annual reporting  periods beginning on or after April, 1 2024 and  must be applied retrospectively to sale and  leaseback transactions entered into after the  date of initial application of Ind AS 116.       The amendments do not have a material impact  on the Company’s financial statements.

The Company was eligible for incentive in the form of exemption of Excise duty on captive consumption of clinker for  the period from February 2005 to February 2013 as per notification no. 67/95-CE dated March 16, 1995. The excise  authorities, Shimla had denied the above exemption to the Company and accordingly the Company paid the aforesaid  duty and expensed the duty amount in the respective earlier financial years. During the year ended March 31, 2025,  the Company received an order from the Office of The Assistant Commissioner - Central Goods and Service Tax,  Shimla Division dated November 27, 2024 allowing refund of amount paid against exemption of excise duty on  captive consumption of clinker by the Company pertaining to Darlaghat unit amounting to  H 189.52 crore.

In a similar incentive claim dispute involving claims of  `  119 crore (involving unilateral change in policy by state  government) in respect of Company’s incentive claim for Farakka plant, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in it's judgement  dated September 27, 2024 rejected the special leave petition submitted by West Bengal Industrial Development  Corporation (WBIDC) against the earlier favourable order of Hon’ble Calcutta High Court (directing state government  to honour its commitments as per applicable West Bengal Incentive Scheme, 2000). The Management of Company  expects that its above incentive claims will be fully realised over the period of time.

(Refer note (g) below)     The gratuity and provident fund plan (till December 31, 2024) is in the form of a trust and it is governed by the  Board of Trustees appointed by the Company. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the  plan assets including investment of the funds. The trust has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of  assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and  long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Company of the benefits provided. To achieve this, investments  are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall  level of assets.     Each year, the Board of Trustees and the Company review the level of funding. Such a review includes the  asset-liability matching strategy and assessment of the investment risk. The Company decides its contribution  based on the results of this annual review.     The plans in India typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk,  longevity risk and salary risk.   i)     Investment  risk:  As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted debt and equity instruments,  the Company is exposed to the risk of impacts arising from fluctuation in interest rates and risks associated  with equity market and related impairment.   ii)     Interest risk:  A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially  offset by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.   iii)     Salary  risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the  plan’s liability.   iv)     Longevity  risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best  estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life  expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. c)     Summary of the components of net benefit / expense recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss, the funded  status and amounts recognised in the Balance Sheet for the respective gratuity plans is as under: H  in crore Particulars 2024-25 2023-24 Funded Non funded Funded Non funded I Expense recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss   1 Current service cost  9.77   0.06   10.04   0.06  2 Interest cost  9.60   0.07   10.12   0.07  3 Interest (income) on plan assets  (8.51)  -   (10.05)  -  Amount recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss  10.86   0.13   10.11   0.13  II Re-measurements recognised in other  comprehensive Income (OCI) 1 Acturial (gains) / losses arising from  Demographic change  (0.87)  -   -   0.00  2 Acturial losses arising from change in  financial assumptions  2.44   0.02   -   -  3 Experience changes losses / (gains)  6.93   (0.06)  (2.97)  (0.01) 4 Return on plan assets (excluding    interest income)  -   -   (0.50)  -  5 Amount recognised in OCI  8.50   (0.04)  (3.47)  (0.01) Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 418 419 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview

Accordingly, the Company’s risk management framework has the objective of  ensuring that such risks are managed within acceptable and approved risk parameters in a disciplined and consistent  manner and in compliance with applicable regulations. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate  skills, experience and supervision. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes  shall be undertaken. The Company’s management is supported by a risk management committee that advises on financial risks and the  appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company. The risk management committee provides assurance  to the Company’s management that the Company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and  procedures and that financial risks are identified measured and managed in accordance with the Company’s policies  and risk objectives. The Board of Directors reviews policies for managing each of these risks. A)   Market risk     Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risks a) commodity price risk b) currency risk and  c) interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk comprise deposits, investments, trade payables.      The Company’s investments are predominantly held in fixed deposits and liquid mutual funds. Mark to market  movements in respect of the Company’s investments are valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss.  Fixed deposits are held with highly rated banks and are not subject to interest rate volatility.   Assumption made in calculating the sensitivity analysis     The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks.  The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity and other  post - retirement obligations and provisions. a)   Commodity Price risk     Commodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to fluctuations in coal and pet coke prices linked to  various external factors, which can affect the production cost of the Company. Since the energy costs is one of  the primary costs drivers, any fluctuation in fuel prices can lead to a drop in operating margin. To manage this  risk, the Company take following steps:   i)   Optimising the fuel mix, pursue longer term and fixed contracts where considered necessary.   ii)     Consistent efforts to reduce the cost of power and fuel by using both domestic and international  coal and petcoke.   iii)     Use of alternative Fuel and Raw Materials (AFR) and enhancing the utilisation of renewable power including  its onsite and offsite solar, wind, hydro power and Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS).     Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management and  fuel requirements are monitored by the central procurement team. b)   Foreign currency risk     Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign  currency, which fluctuate due to change in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes  in foreign exchange rates primarily relate to import of raw materials, fuels and capital items. Based on sensitivity  analysis, the Company has well defined forex exposure threshold limit approved by Board of Directors, beyond  which all forex exposure are fully hedged.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in our  audit of the consolidated financial statements for the  financial year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were  addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated  financial statements as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters. For each matter below, our description  of how our audit addressed the matter is provided  in that context. We have determined the matters described below to be  the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.  We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the  Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated  financial statements section of our report, including in  relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included  the performance of procedures designed to respond to  our assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements. The results of  audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors  of components not audited by us, as reported by them in  their audit reports furnished to us by the management,  including those procedures performed to address the  matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on  the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Litigation and Claims (as described in Notes 3(H), 3.1(I), 52 and 53 of the consolidated financial statements) Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The Holding Company and its subsidiaries (ACC  Limited and Sanghi Industries Limited) have  significant ongoing legal proceedings for various  complex matters relating to direct tax, indirect  tax, government incentive claims and other legal  matters under various laws prevailing in India. The  Group has also deposited substantial amounts  against various matters or accounted as receivable  from authorities against dispute, which has been  classified as “Duty, taxes paid under protest with  Deposits with Government authorities against  various disputes – Other non-current assets” in  Note 14. The provisions made against legal matters  have been included in classified as “Other Payables  - Other current liability” in Note 38”. Due to the magnitude and complexity involved in  these matters, management’s judgement regarding  recognition, measurement and disclosure of  provisions for these legal matters is inherently  uncertain and might change over time as the  outcome of the legal cases are determined or  dispute gets settled. Accordingly, it has been  considered as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included:    Obtained and read the Group’s accounting policies with  respect to contingent liabilities and provisions and assessed  its compliance with Ind AS 37 “Provisions, Contingent  Liabilities and Contingent Assets”.    Obtained understanding of the Holding Company’s and the  subsidiaries process and controls to identify and monitor  all litigations, including Holding Company’s / Subsidiary  Companies process of assessment of litigations as ‘probable’,  ‘possible’ and ‘remote’ and reporting to the Board of Directors  / Audit Committee.    Discussed with the management of Holding Company’s /  Subsidiary Companies including the person responsible  for legal and compliance to obtain an understanding of  the matters involved and development in these matters  compared to previous year.

Revenue recognition, including discounts and rebates to Customers (as described in Note 3(I), 3.1(VI) and 40 of the  consolidated financial statements) Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The Group recognises revenue upon the transfer  of control of goods to the customer, provided  there are no unfulfilled obligations. Revenue is  measured at the fair value of the consideration  received, adjusted for discounts, incentives,  price concessions, rebates, and other similar  adjustments. The timing of revenue recognition,  the determination of when control is transferred,  and the assessment of unfulfilled obligations  require significant judgment, particularly given  the complexity of sales arrangements (including  through Master Supply Agreements (MSA)) and  the varying terms and conditions across different  customer agreements. This complexity is further  compounded by the need to accurately estimate  and apply discounts, rebates, and other adjustments  to arrive at the fair value of consideration in the  appropriate period and the completeness of the  expenses. The Holding Company has established commercial  policy that sets benchmarks or limits for margins in  case of MSA with related parties and for discounts  and rebates, within which individual sales regions  can design and implement their own schemes. This  decentralised approach allows regional sales teams  flexibility in offering rebates, which may result in  variations between regions in terms of the level of  discounts provided.  Given the inherent complexity and judgment  involved in determining the timing of revenue  recognition, the assessment of control transfer, and  the estimation of discounts and rebates including  cut offs, revenue recognition has been identified as  a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included the following:    We have assessed the Group’s accounting policies relating  to recognition and measurement revenue, discounts,  incentives and rebates by comparing with applicable  accounting standards.    We have evaluated the design and implementation of  the Holding Company’s internal controls over revenue  recognition, including policies for discounts, rebates, and  incentives, ensuring alignment with Ind AS 115      We have reviewed a sample of sales contracts, the underlying  documentation for discounts, incentives and rebates  recorded and disbursed during the year to assess the timing  of transfer of control has been satisfied and verified delivery  terms and conditions to ensure revenue recognition aligns  with the transfer of control to customers.    We have tested the accuracy and consistency of discounts,  rebates, and incentives applied to revenue transactions.  Assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates  for measurement of variable considerations including in  case of MSA transaction with related parties, contractual  terms including historical trends of payments and reversal  of discounts, incentives and rebates to provisions made to  assess the current year accruals.    Analysed regional schemes to ensure compliance with  overall commercial policy and benchmarks.  Also, evaluated  the impact of sales region KPIs linked to revenue targets on  the application of discounts and rebates, ensuring no undue  influence on revenue recognition. Business Combination and Purchase of Assets (as described in Notes 3(E) and 67 of the consolidated financial  statement) Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter During the year, the Group has completed following  major acquisitions including finalisation of  acquisition accounting for the acquisitions made  in previous year and in the current year: Name of the Company Date of  acquisition Amount    (INR crores) Sanghi Industries  Limited December  7, 2023 1,682.09 Asian Concretes and  Cements Private  Limited January 8,  2024 422.63 Tuticorin Grinding Unit April 22,  2024 413.75 Penna Cement  Industries Limited  (pending finalisation) August 16,  2024 4,298.32 Further, during the year, the Group has acquired  various parcels of land for the purpose of developing  manufacturing facilities and mining activities which  are accounted as per asset acquisition method as  per applicable Ind AS. We considered audit and accounting of this  acquisition to be a key audit matter considering  above-mentioned acquisition transactions require  significant management judgement regarding:    Allocation of the purchase price to assets and  liabilities acquired and adjustments to align  accounting policies of newly acquired entity  with the Group.      Fair value of the assets acquired (both tangible  and intangible) and liabilities assumed as well as  allocating the consideration transferred between  identifiable assets, liabilities, and excess of  consideration over net assets based on fair value  was recorded as goodwill.    Identification and valuation of intangible assets  and unrecognised liabilities assumed through  business combination. Our audit procedures included:    Read share purchase agreements to obtain an understanding  of the transactions and the key terms and conditions.    Obtained an understanding of design and implementation  of the Group’s controls over the acquisition accounting  process, including the identification and testing of  operating effectiveness, measurement of identifiable assets  and liabilities, the allocation of consideration, and the  determination of goodwill, as applicable. Understanding  the process followed by the Group for assessment and  determination of the effective date and the accounting  treatment for the business combination, including the  identification of assets and liabilities and determination of  their provisional and final fair values and also evaluation of  work of management experts.    Obtained an understanding of the valuation methodologies  used by management and the external valuation experts in  the provisional and final fair valuation of acquired assets  and liabilities.    Traced the value of the considerations with reference to the  Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”).    We involved valuation specialist and assessed the valuation  methodology and assumptions such as discount and  long-term growth rates, risk free rate of return and weight  average cost of capital.    We assessed the competence, capabilities and relevant  experience of the experts engaged by management  to determine final fair valuation of the assets and  liabilities acquired.    We have assessed the accounting treatment followed by  the Company for said acquisitions is in accordance with the  requirements of Ind AS 103 or other applicable Ind AS and  also assessed the compliance of the disclosures made in  note 67 of the consolidated financial statements with the  applicable accounting financial reporting framework.

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter    Impairment assessment of goodwill as at  March 31, 2025 using the value-in-use model  which is based on the net present value of the  forecasted earnings of the acquired entities.  The computation involves using certain  assumptions, discount rates, growth rates and  cash flow forecasts.     Accounting and disclosures in the consolidated  financial statements in accordance with the  applicable Ind-AS. Impairment assessment of Goodwill (as described in Notes 3(E) and 64 of the consolidated financial statements) Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The Group carries a significant amount of goodwill  INR 10,856.07 Crore as on March 31, 2025, arising  from major acquisitions during the current and  earlier years.

In accordance with Ind AS 36, the management  has allocated goodwill to the underlying cash  generating unit (CGU) and tested these for annual  impairment using a discounted cash flow model  if there is an indication of impairment as at the  reporting date. Considering assumptions on which the impairment  assessment is performed require use of significant  managements judgment, in particular with  reference to forecast of future cash flows,  normalised cash flows assumed as a basis for  terminal value, as well as the long-term growth  rates and discount rates and economic conditions  of each CGU which are inherently uncertain, the  annual impairment assessment of goodwill has  been identified as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included:    Obtained an understanding of the Group’s policy on  identification of CGUs, assessment of impairment of goodwill  and assumptions used by the management including the  identification and testing of operating effectiveness of  relevant controls.    Obtained and compared the carrying values of the CGU to  which goodwill is allocated with the net worth of respective  businesses as well as of the underlying assumptions used  with those responsible for the planning process.    Obtained and assessed the appropriateness of the  methodology used in the impairment model, the input data  and underlying assumptions used such as future levels of  operations, discount rate etc. and considered historical  performance vis-à-vis budgets for respective CGUs.    Assessed the recoverable value of goodwill by performing  sensitivity testing of key assumptions used, analysed  and examined the business plans approved along with  assumptions and estimates used by management and tested  the arithmetical accuracy of these models.    Assessed the adequacy of disclosure made in accordance  with the requirement of applicable accounting standards  and applicable reporting framework in the consolidated  financial statements.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated  financial statements, our responsibility is to read the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether  such other information is materially inconsistent with  the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge  obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially  misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we  conclude that there is a material misstatement of this  other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and  Those Charged with Governance for the  Consolidated Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible  for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated  financial statements in terms of the requirements of the  Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated  financial position, consolidated financial performance  including other comprehensive (loss) / income,  consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of  changes in equity of the Group including its associate  and joint ventures in accordance with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133  of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective  Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group  and of its associate and joint ventures are responsible  for maintenance of adequate accounting records in  accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding  of the assets of their respective company(ies) and for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; making judgments and estimates that are  reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,  that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the consolidated  financial statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of  preparation of the consolidated financial statements by  the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the  respective Board of Directors of the companies included  in the Group and of its associate and joint ventures are  responsible for assessing the ability of their respective  company(ies) to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as applicable, matters related to going concern and using  the going concern basis of accounting unless management  either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance of the respective  companies included in the Group and of its  associate and joint ventures are also responsible for  overseeing the financial reporting process of their  respective company(ies). Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements as a  whole are free from material misstatement, whether due  to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high  level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can  arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 470 471 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

of users taken on the basis of these consolidated  financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or  the override of internal control.    Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate  internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements in place and the operating effectiveness  of such controls.    Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management.    Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use  of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material  uncertainty exists related to events or conditions  that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the  Group and its associate and joint ventures to continue  as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention  in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the  consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures  are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group and its associate and  joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the consolidated financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.    Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding  the financial information of the entities or business  activities within the Group and its associate and joint  ventures of which we are the independent auditors,  to express an opinion on the consolidated financial  statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audit of the  financial statements of such entities included in the  consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent auditors. For the other entities included  in the consolidated financial statements, which have  been audited by other auditors, such other auditors  remain responsible for the direction, supervision  and performance of the audits carried out by them.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance of  the Holding Company and such other entities included in  the consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent auditors regarding, among other matters,  the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the consolidated  financial statements for the financial year ended  March 31, 2025 and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless  law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication. Other Matter (a)     We did not audit the financial statements and other  financial information, in respect of 34 subsidiaries  (including step-down subsidiaries and 1 joint  operation of holding company and 4 joint operations  of subsidiary), whose financial statements include  total assets of  I  7,855.30 crores as at March 31,  2025, and total revenue of  I  2,104.84 crores and  net cash outflows of  I  1,676.80 crores for the year  ended on that date.

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s Report of  even date on the Consolidated financial statements  of ambuja cements limited Report on the Internal Financial Controls  under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section  143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements of Ambuja Cements Limited which includes  a joint operation (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding  Company”)  as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025,  we have audited the internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements of the  Holding Company and its subsidiaries including their joint  operations (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries  together referred to as “the Group”), its associate and  joint ventures which are companies incorporated in India,  as of that date. Management’s Responsibility for Internal  Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the companies  included in the Group, its associate and joint ventures  which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible  for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based on the internal financial control over financial  reporting criteria established by the Holding Company  considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by  the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).  These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly  and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and  errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding  company's internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial  Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on  Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to  the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and  the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements was established and maintained and if such  controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements and their operating effectiveness.  Our audit of internal financial controls with reference  to consolidated financial statements included obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing  the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of  internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures  selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including  the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of  the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors  in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters  paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding Company’s  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls  With Reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements A company's internal financial control with reference to  consolidated financial statements is a process designed  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated  financial statements for external purposes in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal financial control with reference to  consolidated financial statements includes those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance  that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that  receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorisations of management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company's assets that could have a material effect on  the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls With Reference to Consolidated  Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls with reference to these consolidated financial  statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements to future periods are subject to the  risk that the internal financial control with reference  to consolidated financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, the Group, its associate and joint  ventures, which are companies incorporated in India,  have, maintained in all material respects, adequate  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements and such internal financial controls  with reference to consolidated financial statements  were operating effectively as at March 31,2025, based  on the internal control over financial reporting criteria  established by the Holding Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Other Matters Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the  adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements in so far as it relates to 34 subsidiaries  (including 1 joint operation of Holding Company and 4  joint operations of subsidiary), 1 associate and 2 joint  ventures which are companies incorporated in India, is  based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of  such companies incorporated in India.

II.     Control is achieved when the Group is exposed,  or has rights, to variable returns from its  involvement with the investee and can affect  those returns through its power over the  investee. Specifically, the Group controls an  investee if and only if the Group has:     a.     Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights  that give it the current ability to direct the  relevant activities of the investee),     b.     Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from  its involvement with the investee, and     c.     The ability to use its power over the investee  to affect its returns.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   III.     Generally, there is a presumption that a majority  of voting rights results in control. To support  this presumption, when the Group has less than  a majority of the voting or similar rights of an  investee, the Group considers all relevant facts  and circumstances in assessing whether it has  power over an investee, including:     a.     The contractual arrangement with the  other vote holders of the investee,     b.     Rights arising from other contractual    arrangements,     c.     The Group’s voting rights and potential    voting rights,     d.     The size of the Group’s holding of voting  rights relative to the size and dispersion  of the holdings of the other voting  rights holders,     e.     Any additional facts and circumstances  that indicate that the Group has, or does  not have, the current ability to direct  the relevant activities at the time when  decisions need to be made, including voting  patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.   IV.     Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when  the Group obtains control over the subsidiary  and ceases when the Group loses control of  the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income, and  expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of  during the year are included in the consolidated  financial statements from the date the Group  gains control until the date the Group ceases to  control the subsidiary.   V.     The financial statements of all entities used  for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up  to same reporting date as that of the parent  company, i.e., year ended on March 31, 2025.   VI.    Consolidated financial statements are  prepared using uniform accounting policies  for like transactions and other events in similar  circumstances. If a member of the group uses  accounting policies other than those adopted  in the consolidated financial statements  for like transactions and events in similar  circumstances, appropriate adjustments are  made to that of the Group member’s financial  statements in preparing the consolidated  financial statements to ensure conformity with  the Group’s accounting policies.   VII.    Profit or loss and each component of other  comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed  to the equity shareholders of the parent and  to the non-controlling interests, even if this  results in the non-controlling interests having  a deficit balance.   VIII.    A change in the ownership interest of a  subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted  for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses  control over a subsidiary, it:     a.     Derecognises the assets (including  goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at  their carrying amounts at the date when  control is lost,     b.     Derecognises the carrying amount of any  non-controlling interest,     c.     Derecognises the cumulative translation  differences recorded in equity,     d.     Recognises the fair value of the consideration    received,     e.     Recognises the fair value of any investment  retained, or, when applicable, the cost on  initial recognition of an investment in an  associate or a joint venture,     f.     Recognises any surplus or deficit in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss,     g.     Reclassifies the parent’s share of  components previously recognised in  other comprehensive income (OCI) to the  consolidated statement of profit and loss  or retained earnings, as appropriate, as  would be required if the Group had directly  disposed of the related assets or liabilities.   IX.   Consolidation procedure     a.     The consolidated financial statements of  the Holding Company and its subsidiaries  have been prepared in accordance with  the Ind AS 110 “Consolidated Financial  Statements”, on a line-by-line basis.     b.     The carrying amount of the parent’s  investment in each subsidiary and the  parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary  is eliminated. Business combination  policy explains how any related  goodwill is accounted.     c.     Intra-group balances and transactions  including unrealised gains / loss from  such transactions are eliminated in  full. Deferred tax is recognised on any  temporary difference that arise from the  elimination of profits and losses resulting  from intra-group transactions.     d.   Investment in associates and joint ventures:         The group holds interests in a joint ventures  and associate. The financial statements of  joint ventures and associates are prepared  for the same reporting period as the Group.  The accounting policies of joint ventures  and associates are aligned with those of  the Group. Therefore, no adjustments are  made when measuring and recognising the  Group’s share of the profit or loss of the  investees after the date of acquisition.         An associate is an entity over which the  Group has significant influence but not  control. Significant influence is the power  to participate in the financial and operating  policy decisions of the investee but is not  control or joint control over those policies.         A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement  in which the Group has joint control and  has rights to the net assets of the joint  arrangement, rather than right to its  assets and obligation for its liabilities.  Joint control is the contractually agreed  sharing of control of an arrangement,  which exists only when decisions about  the relevant activities require unanimous  consent of the parties sharing control.         The considerations made in determining  whether significant influence or joint  control are similar to those necessary to  determine control over the subsidiaries.         The Group’s investments in its associate  and joint venture are accounted for using  the equity method. Under the equity  method, the investment in an associate or a  joint venture is initially recognised at cost.  The carrying amount of the investment  is adjusted to recognise changes in the  Group’s share of net assets of the associate  and joint venture since the acquisition  date. Goodwill relating to the associate  or joint venture is included in the carrying  amount of the investment and is not tested  for impairment individually. Thus, reversals  of impairments may effectively include  reversal of goodwill impairments.  Impairments and reversals are presented  within ‘Share of profit of an associate  and a joint venture’ in the statement of  profit or loss.         The statement of profit and loss reflects the  Group’s share of the results of operations of  the associate and joint venture. Any change  in OCI of those investees is presented as  part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when  there has been a change recognised  directly in the equity of the associate or  joint venture, the Group recognises its  share of any changes, when applicable,  in the statement of changes in equity.  Unrealised gains and losses resulting from  transactions between the Group and the  associate or joint venture are eliminated to  the extent of the interest in the associate  and joint venture.         Consolidated financial statements are  prepared using uniform accounting policies  for like transactions and other events  in similar circumstances. If a member of  the Group uses accounting policies other  than those adopted in the consolidated  financial statements for like transactions  and events in similar circumstances,  appropriate adjustments are made to that  Group member's financial statements  in preparing the consolidated financial  statements to ensure conformity with the  Group's accounting policies.         The financial statements of all entities  used for the purpose of consolidation are  drawn up to same reporting date as that  of the parent company, i.e., year ended  on March 31, 2025.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 from that of a subsidiary, joint venture  and associate, the respective subsidiary,  joint venture and associate prepares,  for consolidation purposes, additional  financial information as of the same date  as the financial statements of the parent  to enable the parent to consolidate the  financial information of the subsidiary,  Joint venture and associate unless it is  impracticable to do so.         The list of companies included in  consolidation, relationship with Ambuja  Cements Limited and Ambuja Cements  Limited’s shareholding therein are  disclosed in Note 11. The reporting date for  all the entities is March 31, 2025 except  otherwise specified. 3.   Summary of Material accounting policies A.   Property, plant and equipment     Property, plant and equipment are stated at their  cost of acquisition / installation / construction net  of accumulated depreciation, and accumulated  impairment losses, if any, except freehold non-mining  land which is carried at cost less accumulated  impairment losses. The cost of acquisition is the cash  price equivalent paid at the recognition date which  is equivalent to the fair value of an asset acquired.     Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset’s  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,  as appropriate, only when it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with the item will  flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.     When significant parts of plant and equipment  are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group  depreciates them separately based on their specific  useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is  performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying  amount of the property, plant and equipment as a  replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.  All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the  consolidated statement of profit and loss during the  reporting period in which they are incurred.     The present value of the expected cost for the  decommissioning of an asset after its use is included  in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition  criteria for provisions are met.     Spares which meet the definition of property, plant  and equipment are capitalised as on the date of  acquisition. The corresponding old spares are  derecognised on such date with consequent impact  in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.     Property, plant and equipment which are not ready  for their intended use as on the balance sheet  date are disclosed as "Capital work-in-progress".  Directly attributable expenditure related to and  incurred during implementation of Capital projects  to get the assets ready for intended use and for a  qualifying assets is included under “Capital work-in- Progress (including related inventories)”. The same  is allocated to the respective items of Property  Plant and Equipment on completion of construction  (development of projects). Capital work in progress is  stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss,  if any. Such items are classified to the appropriate  category of property, plant and equipment when  completed and ready for their intended use.  Advances given towards acquisition / construction of  property, plant and equipment outstanding at each  balance sheet date are disclosed as Capital Advances  under “Other non-current assets”.     Capital expenses incurred by the Group on  construction/development of certain assets which  are essential for production, supply of goods or  for the access to any existing Assets of the Group  are recognised as enabling Assets under Property,  plant and equipment.   Depreciation on property, plant, and equipment   a.     The group, based on technical assessment  made by technical expert and management  estimate, depreciates certain items of building,  plant and equipment over estimated useful  lives which are different from the useful life  prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act,  2013. The management believes that these  estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect  fair approximation of the period over which  the assets are likely to be used. Depreciation is  calculated using “Written down value method”  for assets related to Captive Power Plant and  using “Straight line method” for other assets.   b.     The Group identifies and depreciates cost of  each component / part of the asset separately,  if the component / part have a cost, which is  significant to the total cost of the asset and has  a useful life that is materially different from that  of the remaining asset.   c.     Depreciation on additions to property, plant  and equipment is provided on a pro-rata basis  from the date of acquisition, or installation,  or construction, when the asset is ready  for intended use.   d.     Depreciation on an item of property, plant  and equipment sold, discarded, demolished  or scrapped, is provided upto the date on  which the said asset is sold, discarded,  demolished or scrapped.   e.     Capitalised spares are depreciated over their  own estimated useful life or the estimated useful  life of the parent asset whichever is lower.   f.     The Group reviews the residual value, useful  lives and depreciation method on each reporting  date and, if expectations differ from previous  estimates, the change is accounted for as a  change in accounting estimate on a prospective  basis. The residual values, useful lives and  methods of depreciation of property, plant and  equipment are reviewed at each financial year  end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.   g.     In respect of an asset for which impairment loss,  if any, is recognised, depreciation is provided on  the revised carrying amount of the asset over its  remaining useful life.   h.     Property, plant, and equipment, constructed by  the Group, but ownership of which vests with  the Government / Local authorities:     i.     Expenditure on Power lines is depreciated  over the period as permitted in the Electricity  Supply Act, 1948 / 2003 as applicable.     ii.    Expenditure on Marine structures  is depreciated over the period  of the agreement.     iii.     Expenditure on roads constructed is depreciated for the period ranging from 10 to 30 years. Assets Useful lives Land (freehold) No depreciation except on land with mineral reserves. Cost of mineral reserves embedded in the cost of freehold  mining land is depreciated in proportion of actual quantity of  minerals extracted to the estimated quantity of extractable  mineral reserves Leasehold mining land Amortised over the period of lease on straight line basis Buildings, roads and water works 3 – 60 years Plant and equipment 8 – 50 years Railway sidings and locomotives 8 – 21 years Furniture, office equipment and tools 3 – 10 years Vehicles 6 – 10 years  Ships 25 years   j.     The useful life as estimated above is as per the prescribed useful life specified under Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 except for the following case:  Particulars  Useful Life estimated by the management Useful Life as per Schedule II Plant and Equipment related  to Captive Power Plant   20 to 40 years 40 years       The Management believes that the useful lives as given above reflect fair approximation of the period over  which the assets are likely to be used.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       Derecognition of property plant and  equipment       An item of Property, Plant and Equipment  and any significant part initially recognised  is derecognised upon disposal or when no  future economic benefits are expected from  its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on  derecognition of the asset (calculated as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset) is  recognised in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. B.   Intangible assets     Intangible assets acquired separately are measured  on initial recognition at cost. Cost comprises the  purchase price (net of tax / duty credits availed  wherever applicable) and any directly attributable  cost of bringing the assets to its working condition  for its intended use. The cost of intangible assets  acquired in a business combination is their fair  value at the date of acquisition. Following initial  recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost  less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any.     The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as  either finite or indefinite.     Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over  the useful economic life and assessed for impairment  whenever there is an indication that the intangible  asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and  the amortisation method for an intangible asset  with a finite useful life are reviewed during each  reporting period. Changes in the expected useful  life or the expected pattern of consumption of  future economic benefits embodied in the asset  are considered to modify the amortisation period or  method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in  accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on  intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure  forms part of carrying value of another asset.     Stripping Cost - Stripping costs are allocated and  included as a component of the mine asset when they  represent significantly improved access to limestone,  provided all the following conditions are met:   a.     it is probable that the future economic  benefit associated with the stripping activity  will be realised;   b.     the component of the limestone body for which  access has been improved can be identified; and   c.     the costs relating to the stripping activity  associated with the improved access can be  reliably measured.   Derecognition of intangible assets     An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or  when no future economic benefits are expected  from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from  derecognition of an intangible asset, if any, are  measured as the difference between the net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and  are recognised in the statement of profit and loss  when the asset is derecognised.     Contract based Intangibles     The Group recognises contract-based intangible asset  when the economic benefit under the contract starts  flowing to the entity and control over the intangible  assets is established. Till the time such economic  benefits start flowing to entity, it is disclosed under  Other Non-current assets as “Payment under Long  term supply arrangement”. The Group reclassifies  such balance to intangible assets once the economic  benefit start accruing to the Group.     Contract based intangibles are initially recognised  at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition,  contract-based intangibles are carried at cost  less accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any.     The useful life of the contract-based intangibles  for purpose of its amortisation is considered to be  shorter of the period of contractual rights or period  over which entity expects to obtain economic  benefits from the asset. Further, at every reporting  date, the contract-based intangibles are also tested  for impairment in case of an indication that the  contract-based intangibles might be impaired.   Amortisation of intangible assets     A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets are, as follows: Intangible assets Useful life Amortisation method used Water drawing rights Finite (10-30 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life  Computer software Finite (upto 5 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life Mining rights Finite (upto 90 years) Over the period of the respective mining agreement on  a straight line basis Sponsorship Rights Finite (upto 5 years) Amortised based on occurrence of event Dealer Network Finite (upto 3 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life Brand Finite (upto 3 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life Long term procurement rights Finite (upto 15 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life State incentive rights Finite (upto 4 years) Amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful life C.   Impairment of non-financial assets     The carrying amounts of other non-financial assets,  other than inventories and deferred tax assets are  reviewed at each balance sheet date if there is any  indication of impairment based on internal / external  factors. An impairment loss, if any, is recognised  in the statement of profit and loss wherever the  carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable  amount. The recoverable amount is the higher  of the asset's fair value less cost of disposal and  value in use. Recoverable amount is determined  for an individual asset, unless the asset does not  generate cash inflows that are largely independent  of those from other assets of or Group of assets.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash  flows are discounted to their present value using a  pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and risks  specific to the assets. In determining fair value less  costs of disposal, recent market transactions are  taken into account. If no such transactions can be  provided, an appropriate valuation model is used.  A previously recognised impairment loss, if any is  reversed when there is an indication of reversal,  however, the carrying value after reversal is not  increased beyond the carrying value that would  have prevailed by charging usual depreciation /  amortisation if there was no impairment. D.   Inventories     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each  product to its present location and condition are  accounted for as follows:   I.     Raw materials, stores and spare parts, fuel  and packing material:       Cost includes purchase price, other costs  incurred in bringing the inventories to their  present location and condition, and includes  non-refundable taxes. Materials and other items  held for use in the production of inventories are  not written down below cost if the finished  products in which they will be incorporated are  expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is  determined on a moving weighted average basis.       The Group conducts regular reviews of stores and  spares inventory ageing to identify slow-moving  and non-moving items. Inventories with limited  movement and low anticipated future utility  are appropriately Provided. The Group applies  established provisioning norms to write down  the value of such inventories, based on the  ageing analysis.   II.     Work-in-progress, finished goods and stock in  trade:       Cost includes direct materials and labour and a  proportion of manufacturing overheads based  on normal operating capacity but excluding  borrowing costs. Cost of Stock-in-trade includes  cost of purchase and other cost incurred in  bringing the inventories to the present location  and condition. Cost is determined on a moving  weighted average basis.       Net realisable value is the estimated selling  price in the ordinary course of business, less  estimated costs of completion and estimated  costs necessary to make the sale.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 E.   Business combination and Goodwill     Business combinations are accounted for using the  acquisition method. The consideration transferred  in a business combination is measured at fair value,  which is calculated as the sum of acquisition date  fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities  incurred to the former owner of the acquiree and  the equity interests issued in exchange of control  of the acquiree.     For each business combination, the Group elects  whether to measure the non-controlling interests  in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate  share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.  Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods  in which the costs are incurred and the services are  received, with the exception of the costs of issuing  debt or equity securities that are recognised in  accordance with Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 109.     At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets  acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised  at their acquisition date fair values. For this  purpose, the liabilities assumed include contingent  liabilities representing present obligation and  they are measured at their acquisition fair values  irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits is not probable.  However, the following assets and liabilities acquired  in a business combination are measured on the basis  indicated below:   I.     Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the  assets or liabilities related to employee benefit  arrangements are recognised and measured in  accordance with Ind AS 12 “Income Tax” and Ind  AS 19 “Employee Benefits” respectively.   II.     Potential tax effects of temporary differences  and carry forwards of an acquiree that exist  at the acquisition date or arise as a result of  the acquisition are accounted in accordance  with Ind AS 12.     Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess  of the aggregate of the consideration transferred,  the amount recognised for non-controlling interests  and fair value of any previously held interest in  acquiree, over the net identifiable assets acquired  and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the  net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate  consideration transferred (bargain purchase),  the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly  identified all of the assets acquired and all of the  liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used  to measure the amounts to be recognised at the  acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in  an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  over the aggregate consideration transferred, then  the gain is recognised in Other Comprehensive  Income (OCI) and accumulated in equity as capital  reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of  bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain  directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing  the same through OCI.     Non-controlling interests that are present ownership  interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate  share of the entity’s net assets in the event of  liquidation may be initially measured either at  fair value or at the non-controlling interests’  proportionate share of the recognised amounts of  the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice  of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by- transaction basis. Other types of non-controlling  interests are measured at fair value or, when  applicable, on the basis specified in another Ind AS.     When a business combination is achieved in stages,  the Group’s previously held equity interest in the  acquiree is re-measured to its acquisition-date  fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is  recognised in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss. Amounts arising from interests in the  acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have  previously been recognised in other comprehensive  income are reclassified to the consolidated statement  of profit and loss where such treatment would be  appropriate if that interest were disposed of.     If the initial accounting for a business combination  is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in  which the combination occurs, the Group reports  provisional amounts for the items for which the  accounting is incomplete. Those provisional  amounts are adjusted through goodwill during  the measurement period, or additional assets or  liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information  obtained about facts and circumstances that existed  at the acquisition date that, if known, would have  affected the amounts recognised at that date.  These adjustments are called as measurement period  adjustments. The measurement period does not  exceed one year from the acquisition date.     For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill  acquired in a business combination is, from the  acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s  cash generating units that are expected to benefit  from the combination, irrespective of whether other  assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned  to those units.     Cash generating unit to which goodwill has been  allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more  frequently when there is an indication that the unit  may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the  cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount,  the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the  carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the  unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata  based on the carrying amount of each asset in the  unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of the  assets fair value less cost of disposal and value in  use. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised  in the statement of profit and loss. An impairment  loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in  subsequent periods.   Indemnification Assets     The Group recognises an indemnification asset at  the same time that it recognises the indemnified  item measured on the same basis as the indemnified  item, subject to the need for a valuation allowance  for uncollectible amounts. Therefore, if the  indemnification relates to an asset or a liability that  is recognised at the acquisition date and measured at  its acquisition-date fair value, the Group recognises  the indemnification asset at the acquisition date  measured at its acquisition-date fair value. F.   Fair value measurement     The Group measures financial instruments, such as,  derivatives, government securities and mutual funds  at fair value at each balance sheet date.     The fair value measurement is based on the  presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or  transfer the liability takes place either:   a.   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or   b.     In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability.     The principal or the most advantageous market must  be accessible by the Group.     Fair value is the price that would be received to  sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an  orderly transaction between market participants at  the measurement date. The Group uses valuation  techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances  and for which sufficient data are available to measure  fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable  inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.     All assets and liabilities for which fair value is  measured or disclosed in the financial statements  are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, based  on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair  value measurement as a whole.     External valuers are involved for valuation of  significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets  and financial liabilities and derivatives.     For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the  financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group  determines whether transfers have occurred between  levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation  (based on the lowest level input that is significant to  the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period.     All assets and liabilities for which fair value is  measured as disclosed in the financial statements  are categorised within the fair value hierarchy  described in Note 58. G.   Financial instruments     Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value with the exception of trade  receivables that do not contain a significant financing  component or for which the Group has applied the  practical expedient, the Group initially measures a  financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of  a financial asset not at fair value through profit or  loss, transaction costs. Transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of  financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value  through the statement of profit and loss) are added  to or deducted from the fair value of the financial  assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial  recognition.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 liabilities at fair value through the statement of  profit and loss are recognised immediately in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.   I.   Financial assets     a.     Initial recognition and measurement of  financial assets         The Group recognises a financial asset in  its consolidated balance sheet when it  becomes party to the contractual provisions  of the instrument. All financial assets are  recognised initially at fair value, plus in the  case of financial assets not recorded at fair  value through profit or loss, transaction  costs that are attributable to the  acquisition of the financial asset. All regular  way purchases or sales of financial assets  are recognised and derecognised on a  trade date basis, i.e. the date that the  Group commits to purchase or sell the  asset. Regular way purchases or sales  are purchases or sales of financial assets  that require delivery of assets within the  time frame established by regulation or  convention in the marketplace.         The classification of financial assets  at initial recognition depends on the  financial asset’s contractual cash flow  characteristics and the Group’s business  model for managing them.         Trade receivables that do not contain a  significant financing component or for  which the Group has applied the practical  expedient are measured at the transaction  price determined under Ind AS 115.  Refer to the accounting policies in section  (I) Revenue from contracts with customers.     b.     Subsequent measurement of financial  assets         All recognised financial assets are  subsequently measured in their entirety  at either amortised cost or fair value,  depending on the classification of the  financial assets.         Classification and measurement of  financial assets         For purposes of subsequent measurement,  financial assets are classified in the  following categories:      Financial  assets  measured  at amortised cost         Financial assets that meet the following  conditions are subsequently measured at  amortised cost using effective interest  method ("EIR") (except for debt instruments  that are designated as at fair value through  profit or loss on initial recognition):    the asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets in order  to collect contractual cash flows; and    Contractual terms of the asset give  rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal  and interest (SPPI) on the principal  amount outstanding.         Amortised cost is calculated by taking  into account any discount or premium on  acquisition and fees or costs that are an  integral part of the EIR.         Financial Assets at Fair Value through  Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)         Financial assets that meet the criteria  for initial recognition at FVTOCI are  remeasured at fair value at the end  of each reporting date through other  comprehensive income (OCI).         Financial assets at fair value through  profit or loss (FVTPL)         Financial assets that do not meet the  amortised cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria  are measured at FVTPL.     c.   Derecognition of financial assets         A financial asset (or, where applicable, a  part of a financial asset or part of a Group  of similar financial assets) is primarily  derecognised when:       i.     The rights to receive cash flows from  the asset have expired, or       ii.     The Group has transferred its  contractual rights to receive cash  flows from the asset or has assumed  an obligation to pay the received cash  flows in full without material delay to  a third party under a ‘pass-through’  arrangement and either (a) the Group  has transferred substantially all the  risks and rewards of the asset, or (b)  the Group has neither transferred nor  retained substantially all the risks  and rewards of the asset, but has  transferred control of the asset.         On derecognition of a financial asset in  its entirety, the difference between the  asset’s carrying amount and the sum of  the consideration received and receivable  and the cumulative gain or loss that had  been recognised in other comprehensive  income and accumulated in equity is  recognised in the consolidated statement  of profit and loss if such gain or loss would  have otherwise been recognised in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss  on disposal of that financial asset.     d.   Impairment of financial assets         The Group applies the expected credit  loss model for recognising impairment  loss on financial assets measured at  amortised cost, trade receivables and other  contractual rights to receive cash or other  financial asset.       The Group measures the loss allowance for  a Trade Receivables and Contract Assets by  following ‘simplified approach’ at an amount  equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.  In case of other financial assets 12-month  ECL is used to provide for impairment loss and  where credit risk has increased significantly,  lifetime ECL is used.         The Group considers a financial asset in  default when contractual payments are 90  days past due. However, in certain cases,  the Group may also consider a financial  asset to be in default when internal or  external information indicates that the  Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding  contractual amounts in full before taking  into account any credit enhancements held  by the Group. A financial asset is written off  when there is no reasonable expectation of  recovering the contractual cash flows.   II.   Financial liabilities and equity instruments   a.   Financial liabilities     i.   Initial recognition and measurement         The Group recognises a financial liability  in its consolidated balance sheet when  it becomes party to the contractual  provisions of the instrument. The Group’s  financial liabilities majorly includes trade  payables and payable towards purchase of  Property, Plant and Equipment. All financial  liabilities are recognised initially at fair  value and, in the case of payables, net of  directly attributable transaction costs.         Financial liabilities are classified, at initial  recognition, as financial liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss or at amortised  cost as appropriate.     ii.     Subsequent measurement of financial  liabilities at amortised cost         Financial liabilities that are not held-for- trading and are not designated as at  FVTPL are measured at amortised cost  at the end of subsequent reporting  periods. The carrying amounts of financial  liabilities that are subsequently measured  at amortised cost are determined based on  the effective interest rate method.     iii.     Subsequent measurement of financial  liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss (FVTPL)         Financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss include financial liabilities  held for trading and financial liabilities  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 498 499 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 designated upon initial recognition as at  fair value through profit or loss.         Financial liabilities are classified as held  for trading if they are incurred for the  purpose of repurchasing in the near term.  This category also includes derivative  financial instruments entered into by the  Group that are not designated as hedging  instruments in hedge relationships as  defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded  derivatives are also classified as held for  trading unless they are designated as  effective hedging instruments.         Gains or losses on liabilities held for  trading are recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss account.         Financial liabilities designated upon initial  recognition at fair value through profit or  loss are designated as such at the initial  date of recognition, and only if the criteria  in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.     iv.   Derecognition of financial liabilities         A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged  or cancelled or expired. When an existing  financial liability is replaced by another  from the same lender on substantially  different terms, or the terms of an existing  liability are substantially modified, such  an exchange or modification is treated as  the derecognition of the original liability  and the recognition of a new liability.  The difference in the respective carrying  amounts is recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss.   III.   Offsetting of financial instruments       Financial assets and financial liabilities are  offset, and the net amount is reported in the  consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently  enforceable legal right to offset the recognised  amounts and there is an intention to settle on  a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the  liabilities simultaneously. H.   Provisions and contingencies I.   Provisions   Mines reclamation     The Group provides for the costs of restoring a mine  where a legal or constructive obligation exists.  The estimated future costs for known restoration  requirements are determined on a mine-by-mine  basis and are calculated based on the present value  of estimated future cash out flows.     The restoration provision before exploitation of the  raw materials has commenced is included in Property,  Plant and Equipment and depreciated over the life of  the related asset.     The effect of any adjustments to the provision  due to further environmental damage as a result  of exploitation activities is recorded through the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the  life of the related asset, in order to reflect the best  estimate of the expenditure required to settle the  obligation at the end of the reporting period.     Changes in the measurement of a provision that  result from changes in the estimated timing or  amount of cash outflows, or a change in the discount  rate, are added to or deducted from the cost of the  related asset to the extent that they relate to the  asset’s installation, construction or acquisition.     Provisions are discounted to their present value.  The unwinding of the discount is recognised as  a finance cost in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss.   Other provisions:     Provisions are recognised when the Group has  a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a  result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits will  be required to settle the obligation and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  When the Group expects some or all of a provision  to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance  contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a  separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is  virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision  is presented in the statement of profit and loss net  of any reimbursement. II.   Contingent liability     A contingent liability is a possible obligation that  arises from the past events whose existence will  be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events beyond the  control of the Group or a present obligation that  arises from past events and that is not recognised  because it is not probable that an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefits will be  required to settle the obligation. The Group does  not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its  existence in the financial statements. I.   Revenue recognition     Revenue is recognised on the basis of approved  contracts regarding the transfer of goods or  services to a customer for an amount that reflects  the consideration to which the entity expects to be  entitled in exchange of those goods or services.   I.   Sale of goods       Revenue from the sale of the goods is recognised  when delivery has taken place and control of  the goods has been transferred to the customer  according to the specific delivery term that have  been agreed with the customer and when there  are no longer any unfulfilled obligations.       Revenue is measured after deduction of any  discounts, price concessions, volume rebates  and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of  the government such as goods and services  tax, etc. The Group accrues for such discounts,  price concessions and rebates at inception  to determine the transaction price based on  historical experience and specific contractual  terms with the customer.       The disclosure of significant accounting  judgements, estimates and assumptions relating  to revenue from contracts with customers are  provided in Note 3.1 (VI).       No element of financing is deemed present as the  sales are made with credit terms largely ranging  between 30 days and 60 days depending on the  specific terms agreed with customers.   II.   Rendering of services       Income from services rendered is recognised  at a point in time based on agreements /  arrangements with the customers when the  services are performed and there are no  unfulfilled obligations.   III.     Contract assets, Trade receivables and  Contract liabilities:    Contract  asset:       A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Group performs by  transferring goods or services to a customer  before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that  is conditional. Contract assets are subject to  impairment assessment.    Trade  receivables       A receivable represents the Group’s right to an  amount of consideration that is unconditional  i.e., only the passage of time is required before  payment of consideration is due and the  amount is billable.     Contract  liabilities       A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which the  Group has received consideration from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as  revenue when the Group performs obligations  under the contract.     Rebates to customers (Refund liabilities)       Rebates to customers is recognised for the  credit under various schemes including  expected future rebates that are expected  to be claimed by the customers. The Group  updates its estimates of rebates at the end of  each reporting period. The Group does not have  material sales return and hence, no liabilities are  recognised towards the sales at reporting date.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   IV.   Interest income       Interest income from a financial asset is  recognised when it is probable that the  economic benefits will flow to the Group and  the amount of income can be measured reliably.  Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by  reference to the principal outstanding and at  the effective interest rate applicable, which  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash receipts through the expected life  of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying  amount on initial recognition.   V.   Dividends       Dividend income is recognised when right  to receive is established (provided that it is  probable that the economic benefits will flow  to the Group and the amount of income can be  measured reliably). J.   Retirement and other employee benefits   I.   Defined contribution plan       Employee benefits in the form of contribution to  Superannuation Fund, Provident Fund managed  by government authorities, Employees State  Insurance Corporation and Labour Welfare Fund  are considered as defined contribution plans  and the same are charged to the consolidated  statement of profit and loss for the year in which  the employee renders the related service.   II.   Defined benefit plan       The Group's gratuity fund scheme, additional  gratuity scheme and post-employment benefit  scheme are considered as defined benefit plans.  The Group's liability is determined on the basis  of an actuarial valuation using the projected  unit credit method as at the balance sheet date.       Employee benefit in respect of certain categories  of employees, are provided in the form of  contribution to provident fund managed by a trust  set up by the Holding Company and Subsidiary  Company ACC Limited till December 31, 2024,  is charged to consolidated statement of profit  and loss for the year in which the employee  renders the related service. The Group has  an obligation to make good the shortfall, if  any, between the return from the investment  of the trust and interest rate notified by the  Government of India till December 31, 2024.  Such shortfall is recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss based on actuarial  valuation. W.e.f. January 1, 2025, such  categories of employee benefit has also been  included in defined employee contribution plan  as stated above.       Past service costs are recognised in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss on  the earlier of:     a.     The date of the plan amendment or  curtailment, and     b.     The date that the Group recognises related  restructuring costs       The net interest cost is calculated by applying  the discount rate to the net balance of the  defined benefit obligation and the fair value of  plan assets. The Group recognises the following  changes in the net defined benefit obligation  as an expense in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss:     a.     Service costs comprising current service  costs, past-service costs, gains and  losses on curtailments and non-routine  settlements; and     b.   Net interest expense or income     c.     Re-measurements, comprising actuarial  gains and losses, the effect of the asset  ceiling (if any), and the return on plan  assets (excluding net interest), are  recognised immediately in the consolidated  balance sheet with a corresponding debit  or credit to retained earnings through  OCI in the period in which they occur.  Re-measurements are not reclassified to  the consolidated statement of profit and  loss in subsequent periods.   III.   Short term employee benefits     a.     Short term employee benefits that are  expected to be settled wholly within 12  months after the end of the period in  which the employees render the related  service are recognised as an expense at the  undiscounted amount in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss of the year in  which the related service is rendered.      Accumulated  Compensated  absences,  which are expected to be settled wholly  within 12 months after the end of the  period in which the employees render the  related service, are treated as short term  employee benefits. The Group measures  the expected cost of such absences as the  additional amount that it expects to pay as  a result of the unused entitlement that has  accumulated at the reporting date.   IV.   Other long-term employee benefits       Compensated absences are provided for on  the basis of an actuarial valuation, using the  projected unit credit method, as at the date of  the consolidated balance sheet. Actuarial gains  / losses, if any, are immediately recognised in the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.       Long service awards and accumulated  compensated absences which are not expected  to be settled wholly within 12 months after the  end of the period in which the employees render  the related service are treated as other long term  employee benefits for measurement purposes.   V.   Termination benefits       Termination benefits are payable when  employment is terminated by the Group  before the normal retirement date, or when  an employee accepts voluntary redundancy  in exchange for these benefits. The Group  recognises termination benefits at the earlier  of the following:     a.     when the Group can no longer withdraw the  offer of those benefits; and     b.     when the Group recognises costs for a  restructuring that is within the scope of  Ind AS 37 and involves the payment of  termination benefits.       In the case of an offer made to encourage  voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits  are measured based on the number of employees  expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling  due more than 12 months after the end of the  reporting period are discounted to present value.   VI.   Presentation and disclosure       For the purpose of presentation of defined  benefit plans, the allocation between the short  term and long-term provisions have been made  as determined by an actuary. Obligations under  other long-term benefits are classified as  short-term provision, if the Group does not have  an unconditional right to defer the settlement  of the obligation beyond 12 months from the  reporting date. The Group presents the entire  compensated absences as short-term provisions,  since employee has an unconditional right to  avail the leave at any time during the year. K.   Taxation     Tax expense comprises current income tax and  deferred income tax and includes any adjustments  related to past periods in current and / or deferred  tax adjustments that may become necessary due  to certain developments or reviews during the  relevant period.   I.   Current income tax       Current income tax assets and liabilities  are measured at the amount expected to  be recovered from or paid to the taxation  authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to  compute the amount are those that are enacted  or substantively enacted, at the reporting date  in the countries where the Group operates and  generates taxable income.       Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside the consolidated statement of profit  and loss is recognised in correlation to the  underlying transaction either in OCI or directly  in equity. Management periodically evaluates  positions taken in the tax returns with respect  to situations in which applicable tax regulations  are subject to interpretation and recognise  expense where appropriate.       Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are  offset when there is a legally enforceable right  to set off the recognised amounts and there is  an intention to settle the asset and the liability  on a net basis.   II.   Deferred tax       Deferred tax is recognised for the future  tax consequences of deductible temporary  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 502 503 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 differences between the carrying values of  assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases at the reporting date.       Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all  taxable temporary differences, except:    When the deferred tax liability arises from  the initial recognition of goodwill or an  asset or liability in a transaction that is not a  business combination and, at the time of the  transaction, affects neither the accounting  profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not  give rise to equal taxable and deductible  temporary differences.    In respect of taxable temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures,  when the timing of the reversal of the  temporary differences can be controlled and  it is probable that the temporary differences  will not reverse in the foreseeable future.       Deferred tax assets are recognised for all  deductible temporary differences, the carry  forward of unused tax credits and any unused  tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised  only to the extent that it is probable that  sufficient future taxable income will be available  against which such deferred tax assets can be  realised, except:    When the deferred tax asset relating to  the deductible temporary difference arises  from the initial recognition of an asset  or liability in a transaction that is not a  business combination and, at the time of the  transaction, affects neither the accounting  profit nor taxable profit or loss.    In respect of deductible temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures,  deferred tax assets are recognised only to the  extent that it is probable that the temporary  differences will reverse in the foreseeable  future and taxable profit will be available  against which the temporary differences  can be utilised.       The carrying amount of deferred tax assets  are reviewed at each balance sheet date.  The Group writes-down the carrying amount of  a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which deferred  tax asset can be realised. Any such write-down  is reversed to the extent that it becomes  reasonably certain that sufficient future taxable  income will be available.       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  based on the tax rates that are expected to  apply in the year when the asset is realised or  the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax  laws) that have been enacted or substantively  enacted at the reporting date.       Deferred tax relating to items recognised  outside the consolidated statement of profit  and loss is recognised outside profit or loss  (either in other comprehensive income or in  equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in  correlation to the underlying transaction either  in OCI or directly in equity.       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset  when there is a legally enforceable right to  offset current tax assets and liabilities and  when the deferred tax balances relate to the  same taxation authority.       The Group applies significant judgment in  identifying uncertainties over income tax  treatments. Uncertain tax positions are reflected  in the overall measurement of the Group’s tax  expense and are based on the most likely amount  or expected value that is to be disallowed by the  taxing authorities whichever better predict the  resolution of uncertainty. Uncertain tax balances  are monitored and updated as and when new  information becomes available, typically upon  examination or action by the taxing authorities  or through statute expiration.       Tax benefits acquired as part of a business  combination, but not satisfying the criteria  for separate recognition at that date, are  recognised subsequently if new information  about facts and circumstances change.  Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised  within the measurement period reduce goodwill  related to that acquisition if they result from  new information obtained about facts and  circumstances existing at the acquisition date.  If the carrying amount of goodwill is zero, any  remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised  in OCI/ capital reserve depending on the principle  explained for bargain purchase gains. All other  acquired tax benefits realised are recognised in  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.       In the situations where one or more units of  the Group are entitled to a tax holiday under  the tax law, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is  recognised in respect of temporary differences  which reverse during the tax holiday period,  to the extent the concerned unit’s gross total  income is subject to the deduction during the  tax holiday period. Deferred tax in respect of  temporary differences which reverse after the  tax holiday period is recognised in the year in  which the temporary differences originate.  However, the Group restricts recognition of  deferred tax assets to the extent it is probable  that sufficient future taxable income will be  available against which such deferred tax assets  can be realised. For recognition of deferred  taxes, the temporary differences which originate  first are considered to reverse first. L.   Leases     The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains  a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or  contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to  control the use of an identified asset for a period of  time in exchange for consideration.   I.   Group as a lessee:    Right-of-use  assets       At the date of commencement of the lease,  the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and  a corresponding lease liability for all lease  arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for  short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.       The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at  cost, which comprises the initial amount of the  lease liability adjusted for any lease payments  made at or prior to the commencement date  of the lease plus any initial direct costs less  any lease incentives. They are subsequently  measured at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses, if any.  Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the  commencement date on a straight-line basis  over the shorter of the lease term and useful  life of the underlying asset: Right of use assets Term (in years) Buildings 2-30 Leasehold land 3-99 Ships and tugs 2-13 Furniture, vehicles and tools 5 Plant and Equipment 6       The right of use assets is also subject to  impairment. Right of use assets are evaluated  for recoverability whenever events or changes  in circumstances indicate that their carrying  amounts may not be recoverable.    Lease  liabilities       Lease liability is initially measured at the  present value of the future lease payments.  The lease payments are discounted using the  interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily  determinable, using the incremental borrowing  rates. The Group uses the incremental borrowing  rate as the discount rate.       Lease payments included in the measurement  of the lease liability include fixed payments,  variable lease payments that depend on an index  or a rate known at the commencement date;  and extension option payments or purchase  options payments which the Group is reasonably  certain to exercise.       Variable lease payments that do not depend  on an index or rate are not included in the  measurement the lease liability and the ROU  asset. The related payments are recognised as  an expense in the period in which the event or  condition that triggers those payments occurs  and are included in the line “Other expenses” in  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.       The lease term comprises the non-cancellable  lease term together with the period covered  by extension options, if assessed as reasonably  certain to be exercised, and termination options,  if assessed as reasonably certain not to be  exercised. For lease arrangement in respect  of ships, the non-lease components are not  separated from lease components and instead  Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 504 505 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 account for each lease component, and any  associated non-lease component as a single  lease component.       The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by  increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest  on the lease liabilities, reducing the carrying  amount to reflect the lease payments made.       ROU asset and lease liabilities have been  separately presented in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet and lease payments have been  classified as financing cash flows.       Short-term leases and leases of low-value  assets       The Group applies the short-term lease  recognition exemption to its short-term leases  (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12  months or less from the commencement date).  It also applies the low-value asset recognition  exemption on a lease-by-lease basis, if the lease  qualifies as leases of low-value assets. In making  this assessment, the Company also factors  below key aspects:     a)     The assessment is conducted on an  absolute basis and is independent of the  size, nature, or circumstances of the lessee.     b)      The assessment is based on the value of the  asset when new, regardless of the asset's  age at the time of the lease.     c)      The lessee can benefit from the use of  the underlying asset either independently  or in combination with other readily  available resources, and the asset is  not highly dependent on or interrelated  with other assets.     d)      If the asset is subleased or expected to be  subleased, the head lease does not qualify  as a lease of a low-value asset.       Lease payments on short-term leases and leases  of low-value assets are recognised as expense  on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The related cash flows are classified as Operating  activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.   II.   Group as a lessor:       The determination of whether an arrangement is  (or contains) a lease is based on the substance  of the arrangement at the inception of the  lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease  if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent  on the use of a specific asset or assets and the  arrangement conveys a right to use the asset  or assets, even if that right is not explicitly  specified in an arrangement. Leases are  classified as finance leases whenever the terms  of the lease transfer substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  All other leases are classified as operating  leases. Rental income from operating leases  is generally recognised on a straight-line basis  over the term of the relevant lease. Where the  rentals are structured solely to increase in line  with expected general inflation to compensate  for the Group's expected inflationary cost  increases, such increases are recognised in the  year in which such benefits accrue. Initial direct  costs incurred in negotiating and arranging  an operating lease are added to the carrying  amount of the leased asset and recognised on  a straight-line basis over the lease. M.    Government grants and subsidies including  duty credits/refunds     Government grants are recognised when there is a  reasonable assurance that the grant will be received,  and all attached conditions will be complied with.     Where the grants relate to an item of expense, they  are recognised as income on a systematic basis in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss over the  periods necessary to match them with the related  costs, which they are intended to compensate.     Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised  as income in equal amounts over the expected useful  life of the related asset.     When the Group receives grants of non-monetary  assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair  value amounts and released to the consolidated  statement of profit and loss over the expected useful  life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the  underlying asset.     When loans or similar assistance are provided by  governments or related institutions, with an interest  rate below the current applicable market rate, the  effect of this favourable interest is regarded as a  government grant. The loan or assistance is initially  recognised and measured at fair value and the  government grant is measured as the difference  between the initial carrying value of the loan and  the proceeds received. The loan is subsequently  measured as per the accounting policy applicable to  financial liabilities. N.   Earnings per share     Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the  net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders  of the Company by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the period.     Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing  the profit after tax as adjusted for dividend, interest  and other charges to expense or income (net of any  attributable taxes) relating to the dilutive potential  equity shares, by the weighted average number of  equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings  per share and the weighted average number of equity  shares which could have been issued on conversion  of all dilutive potential equity shares. O.   Foreign currencies translations:     The Group’s consolidated financial statements are  presented in ( I ), which is also the parent company’s  functional currency.     Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in  foreign currencies are translated at the functional  currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting  date. Exchange differences on monetary items  are recognised in profit and loss in the period in  which they arise.     Non-monetary items which are carried in terms of  historical cost denominated in a foreign currency  are reported using the exchange rate at the date of  the transaction. P.   Cash and cash equivalents     Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and  for the purpose of consolidated statement of cash  flows comprise cash at banks and on hand, short-term  deposits with an original maturity of three months or  less and investment in liquid mutual funds that are  readily convertible to a known amount of cash and  subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Q.   Dividend     The Holding Company recognises a liability to pay  dividend to equity holders of the parent when the  distribution is authorised, and the distribution  is no longer at the discretion of the Holding  Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a  distribution is authorised when it is approved by the  shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised  directly in equity. R.   Segment reporting   a.   Segment Policies       The Group prepares its segment information in  conformity with the accounting policies adopted  for preparing and presenting the Consolidated  financial statements of the Group as a whole.   b.   Identification of segments       An operating segment is a component of the  Group that engages in business activities from  which it may earn revenues and incur expenses,  whose operating results are regularly reviewed  by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker  (“CODM”) to make decisions for which discrete  financial information is available.       The Board of Directors of the Group has  appointed Management Committee (ManCom)  which has been identified as being the  CODM. The ManCom assesses the financial  performance and position of the Group and  makes strategic decisions.       The Group's operating businesses are organised  and managed separately according to the  nature of products and services provided, with  each segment representing a strategic business  unit that offers different products and serves  different markets.   c.   Allocation of common costs       Common allocable costs are allocated to each  segment according to the relative contribution  of each segment to the total common costs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025   d.   Inter-segment transfers       Inter-segment revenue has been accounted  for based on the transaction price agreed  to between segments which is based on  current market prices.   e.   Unallocated items       Revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities which  relate to the Group as a whole and not allocable  to segments on reasonable basis have been  included under ‘unallocated revenue / expenses  / assets / liabilities. S.     Classification of current and non-current assets  and liabilities     The operating cycle is the time between the  acquisition of assets for processing and their  realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Group  has identified twelve months as its operating cycle for  determining current and non-current classification  of assets and liabilities in the Balance sheet. T.   Exceptional Items     Exceptional items refer to items of income or  expense, within the statement of profit and loss from  ordinary activities which are non-recurring and are  of such size, nature or incidence that their separate  disclosure is considered necessary to explain the  performance of the Group. 3.1    Use of estimates and judgments     The preparation of the Group’s consolidated  financial statements requires management to make  judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the  reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and  liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the  disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about  these assumptions and estimates could result in  outcomes that require a material adjustment to the  carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in  future periods.     Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated  and are based on historical experience and  other factors, including expectations of future  events that are believed to be reasonable under  the circumstances.     The estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to  accounting estimates are recognised in the period  in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects  only that period, or in the period of the revision and  future period, if the revision affects current and  future period. Revisions in estimates are reflected in  the consolidated financial statements in the period  in which changes are made and, if material, their  effects are disclosed in the consolidated notes to  the financial statements.     The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  are described below. Existing circumstances and  assumptions about future developments may change  due to market changes or circumstances arising that  are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes  are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.   I.     Classification of legal matters and tax  litigations (Refer Note 52)       The litigations and claims to which the Group  is exposed to are assessed by management  with assistance of the legal department and  in certain cases with the support of external  specialised lawyers. Determination of the  outcome of these matters into “Probable,  Possible and Remote” require judgement and  estimation on case to case basis.   II.   Defined benefit obligations (Refer Note 55)       The cost of defined benefit gratuity plans, and  post-retirement medical benefit is determined  using actuarial valuations. The actuarial  valuation involves making assumptions about  discount rates, future salary increases, mortality  rates and future pension increases. Due to the  long-term nature of these plans, such estimates  are subject to significant uncertainty.   III.     Useful life of Property, plant and equipment  (Refer Note 4)       The charge in respect of periodic depreciation  is derived after determining an estimate  of an asset's expected useful life and the  expected residual value. Increasing an asset's  expected life or its residual value would  result in a reduced depreciation charge in the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.  The useful lives of the Group's assets are  determined by management at the time the  asset is acquired and reviewed at least annually  for appropriateness. The lives are based on  historical experience with similar assets as well  as anticipation of future events, which may  impact their life, such as changes in technology.   IV.     Impairment of property, plant and equipment  (Refer Note 4)       Determining whether the property, plant and  equipment are impaired requires an estimate of  the value of use. In considering the value in use,  the management has anticipated the capacity  utilisation of plants, operating margins, mineable  resources and availability of infrastructure  of mines, and other factors of the underlying  businesses / operations. Any subsequent  changes to the cash flows due to changes in  the above-mentioned factors could impact the  carrying value of property, plant and equipment.   V.     Incentives under the State Industrial Policy  (Refer Note 13 and 21)       The Group’s manufacturing units in various  states are eligible for incentives under the  respective State Industrial Policy. The Group  accrues these incentives as refund claims  in respect of VAT/GST paid, on the basis that  all attaching conditions were fulfilled by the  Group and there is reasonable assurance that  the incentive claims will be disbursed by the  State Governments.       The Group measures expected credit losses in  a way that reflects the time value of money.  Any subsequent changes to the estimated  recovery period could impact the carrying value  of Incentives receivable.   VI.     Discounts / rebate to customers (Refer Note  40)       The Group provides discount and rebates on  sales to certain customers. Revenue from these  sales is recognised based on the price charged  to the customer, net of the estimated pricing  allowances, discounts, rebates, and other  incentives. In certain cases, the amount of these  discount and rebates are not determined until  claims with appropriate evidence is presented by  the customer to the Group, which may be some  time after the date of sale. Accordingly, the  Group estimates the amount of such incentives  basis the terms of contract, incentive schemes,  historical experience adjusted with the forward  looking, business forecast and the current  economic conditions. To estimate the amount  of incentives, the Group uses the most likely  method. Such estimates are subject to the  estimation uncertainty.   VII.     Physical verification of Inventory (Refer Note  15)       Bulk inventory for the Group primarily comprises  of coal, petcoke and clinker which are primarily  used during the production process at the  manufacturing locations. Determination of  physical quantities of bulk inventories is done  based on volumetric measurements and involves  special considerations with respect to physical  measurement, density calculation, moisture,  etc. which involve estimates / judgments. 3.2   New and Amended Standards:     The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notified the  Ind AS 117, Insurance Contracts, vide notification  dated 12 August 2024, under the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2024,  which is effective from annual reporting periods  beginning on or after 1 April 2024.   a.     Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts is a  comprehensive new accounting standard for  insurance contracts covering recognition and  measurement, presentation and disclosure.  Ind AS 117 replaces Ind AS 104 Insurance  Contracts. Ind AS 117 applies to all types of  insurance contracts, regardless of the type of  entities that issue them as well as to certain  guarantees and financial instruments with  discretionary participation features; a few scope  exceptions will apply. Ind AS 117 is based on a  general model, supplemented by:    A specific adaptation for contracts  with direct participation features (the  variable fee approach)    A simplified approach (the premium allocation  approach) mainly for short-duration contracts Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 508 509 AMBUJA CEMENTS LIMITED Portfolio Overview Financial Statements Statutory Reports ESG Overview Strategic Review Corporate Overview 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as at March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025       The application of Ind AS 117 does not have  material impact on the Group’s separate financial  statements as the Group has not entered any  contracts in the nature of insurance contracts  covered under Ind AS 117.   b.     Amendments to Ind AS 116 Leases – Lease  Liability in a Sale and Leaseback       The MCA notified the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Second Amendment  Rules, 2024, which amend Ind AS 116,  Leases, with respect to Lease Liability in a  Sale and Leaseback.       The amendment specifies the requirements  that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the  lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback  transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does not  recognise any amount of the gain or loss that  relates to the right of use it retains.

The deferred tax asset of  I  36.94 Crore  and deferred tax asset of  I  133.91 Crore has been reversed as at year  ended March 31, 2025. d)     As at March 31, 2025, Subsidiary Company Sanghi Industries Limited ("Sanghi") had not recognised deffered tax  asset on unabsorbed depreciation of  I  745.58 Crore. The information is based on the returns of income filed by  the Penna upto assessment year 2024-2025. e)     In Sanghi Industries Limited ("Sanghi") for the A.Y. 2017-18, there is ongoing litigation related to Specified Domestic  Transaction related to adjustment on transfer of power from eligible unit to non-eligible unit under Section 80IC  of the Income Tax Act amounting to  I  155.81 crores. Currently the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has  adjudicated the matter in favour of revenue department vide order dated 23 January 2025. Management aggrieved  by the order passed by ITAT, is planning to contest the matter in the Gujarat High Court in due course and as per  the management's risk assessment based on the merits of the case, it is assessed as "possible" risk category and  hence the same is contingent on actual outcome. However, Sanghi has accumulated brought-forward business  losses and unabsorbed depreciation exceeding the amount under dispute for that particular Assessment Year.  Accordingly, any potential disallowance would only lead to a reduction in carried forward losses and there will not  be any cash outflow even in case the decision comes against the Sanghi. Hence, management has not disclosed  the same as contingent liability in the financial statements. f)     As at March 31, 2025, Subsidiary Company Penna Cement Industries Limited ("Penna") had not recognised deffered  tax asset on carried forward tax losses providing to current year  and unabsorbed depreciation of  `  111.98 Crore.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the for the year ended March 31, 2025 Notes: a)     In respect of above matters, future cash outflows are determinable only on receipt of judgements / decisions  pending at various forums / authorities. b)   Demand from Competition Commission of India:   i)     In 2012, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had imposed a penalty of  I  1,163.91 crore (Previous year    I  1,163.91 crore) on the Holding Company and  I  1,147.59 crore (Previous year  I  1,147.59 crore) on its subsidiary  ACC Limited, aggregating to  I  2,311.50 crore, concerning alleged contravention of the provisions of the  Competition Act, 2002. On appeal by the Holding Company and ACC Limited, the Competition Appellate  Tribunal (COMPAT), initially stayed the penalty and by its final order dated December 11, 2015, set aside the  order of the CCI, remanding the matter back to the CCI for fresh adjudication and for passing a fresh order.       After hearing the matter afresh, the CCI had again, by its order dated August 31, 2016, imposed penalty of    I  1,163.91 crore on the Holding Company and  I  1,147.59 crore on ACC Limited, aggregating to  I  2,311.50 crore.  The Holding Company and ACC Limited filed appeals against the said Order before the COMPAT. The COMPAT,  vide its interim order dated November 21, 2016 has stayed the penalty with a condition to deposit 10% of the  penalty amount, in the form of fixed deposit (the said condition has been complied with) and levy of interest  of 12% p.a., in case the appeal is decided against the appellant. Meanwhile, pursuant to the notification issued  by Central Government on May 26, 2017, any appeal, application or proceeding before COMPAT is transferred  to National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).       NCLAT, vide Order dated July 25, 2018, dismissed the appeal filed by the Holding Company and ACC Limited  and upheld the CCI’s order. Against this, the Holding Company and ACC Limited appealed to the Hon'ble  Supreme Court on September 12, 2018 which by its order dated October 05, 2018 admitted the appeal and  directed to continue the interim order passed by the COMPAT will continue in the meantime. Presently, the  matter is pending for hearing with Hon'ble Supreme Court.   ii)     In a separate matter, pursuant to a reference filed by the Government of Haryana, the CCI by its Order dated  January 19, 2017, had imposed a penalty of  I  29.84 Crores on the Holding Company and  I  35.32 Crores on  ACC Limited. On appeal by the Holding Company and ACC Limited, COMPAT had stayed the operation of the  CCI’s Order. The matter is now listed before the NCLAT and is pending for hearing.       Based on the advice of external legal counsels, the Holding Company and ACC Limited believe they have  good grounds on merit for a successful appeal in both the aforesaid matters. Accordingly, no provision is  considered necessary and the matter along with interest of  I  2,265.04 crore (March 31, 2024 -  I  1,993.78  crore) has been disclosed as contingent liability. c)   Government incentive includes:   i)     A matter relating to Holding Company for 75% exemption from Rajasthan Sales tax, granted by Government  of Rajasthan in financial year 2001-02. However, the eligibility of exemption in excess of 25% was contested  by the State Government in a similar matter of another Company.       In the year 2014, pursuant to the unfavourable decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in that similar matter,  the sales tax department initiated proceedings for recovery of differential sales tax and interest thereon on  the ground that the Holding Company had given an undertaking to deposit the differential amount of sales  tax, in case decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court goes against in this matter.

Trust managed provident fund plan was operative till December 31,2024 and  thereafter the balance was transferred to the account of the Central board of trustees, Employees Provident  Fund. (Refer Note (e) below)     The gratuity and provident fund plan (December 31, 2024) is in the form of a trust and it is governed by the  Board of Trustees appointed by the Holding Company and the Subsidiary Company ACC Limited. The Board of  Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets including investment of the funds. The trust has  developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk  and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the  benefits provided. To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment  would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.     Each year, the Board of Trustees and the Group review the level of funding. Such a review includes the asset-liability  matching strategy and assessment of the investment risk. The Group decides its contribution based on the results  of this annual review.     The plans in India typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity  risk and salary risk.   i)     Investment  risk:  As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted debt and equity instruments,  the Group is exposed to the risk of impacts arising from fluctuation in interest rates and risks associated  with equity market and related impairment.   ii)     Interest risk:  A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially  offset by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.   iii)     Salary  risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the  plan’s liability.

An increase in the life  expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. c)     Summary of the components of net benefit / expense recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss  and the funded status and amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the respective gratuity plans: I  in crore Particulars 2024-25 2023-24 Funded Non funded Funded Non funded I Components of expense recognised in the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 1 Current service Cost  21.71   8.69   22.78   8.74  2 Interest cost  22.27   7.30   22.86   7.34  3 Interest (income) on plan assets  (24.83)   -     (24.20)   -    4 Past service cost   -      -      -     7.33  Total  19.15   15.99   21.44   23.41  II Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income 1 Actuarial (gains) / losses arising from  Demographic changes  (0.97)  (0.09)   -     0.00  2 Actuarial losses arising from change in financial  assumptions  6.86   0.62   0.05   0.03  3 Experience changes losses / (gains)  2.87   19.84   (4.58)  (7.49) 4 Return on plan assets (excluding interest income)  (0.88)   -     (4.06)   -    Total  7.88   20.37   (8.59)  (7.46) III Net asset / (liability) recognised in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet 1 Present value of defined benefit obligation  297.80   130.38   282.96   99.78  2 Fair value of plan assets  280.28    -     332.51    -    3 Funded status (surplus / (deficit))  (17.52)  (130.38)  49.55   (99.78) 4 Net asset / (liability)  (17.52)  (130.38)  49.55   (99.78) IV Change in defined benefit obligation during the year 1 Present value of defined benefit obligation at  the beginning of the year  282.96   99.78   332.89   98.88  2 Present value of defined benefit obligation  added during the year pursuant to the  acquisition of subsidiary (Refer Note 67)  15.59   (0.05)   -     6.96  3 Current service cost  21.71   8.69   22.78   8.74  4 Interest service cost  22.27   7.30   22.86   7.34  5 Past service cost   -      -      -     7.33  6 Actuarial (gains)/losses recognised in  consolidated other comprehensive income: - Demographic changes  (0.87)  (0.09)   -     0.00  - Change in financial assumptions  5.34   0.62   0.05   0.03  - Experience Changes   5.72   19.84   (4.58)  (7.49) 7 Benefit payments  (45.63)  (5.71)  (89.69)  (22.01) 8 Net transfer in on account of business  combinations / others  (9.29)   -     (1.35)   -    9 Present value of defined benefit obligation  297.80   130.38   282.96   99.78  V Change in fair value of assets during the year I  in crore Particulars 2024-25 2023-24 Funded Non funded Funded Non funded 1 Plan assets at the beginning of the year  332.52    -     336.10    -    2 Plan assets added during the year pursuant to  the acquisition of subsidiary  8.92    -      -      -    3 Interest income   24.83    -     24.20    -    4 Contribution by employer  15.89    -      -      -    5 Actual benefit paid  (102.76)   -     (31.84)   -    6 Return on plan assets , excluding amount  recognised in net interest expense  0.88    -     4.06    -    7 Plan assets at the end of the year  280.28    -     332.52    -    VI Weighted average duration of defined benefit  obligation  5 years  6 years  10 years 10 to 10.20  years VII Sensitivity analysis for significant assumptions  (Refer note (i) below) Present value of defined benefits obligation at the  end of the year  1 For increase in discount rate by 100 basis points  264.52   116.29   264.56   83.94  2 For decrease in discount rate by 100 basis  points  294.85   139.58   303.69   101.14  3 For increase in salary rate by 100 basis points  294.68   139.39   303.52   101.01  4 For decrease in salary rate by 100 basis points  264.41   116.24   264.36   83.91  5 For increase in attrition rate*   277.87   128.24   283.10   76.50  6 For decrease in attrition rate*   280.23   127.18   282.69   73.42  7 For increase in mortality rate #  278.93   130.37   282.96   75.21  8 For decrease in mortality rate #  281.10   124.22   282.93   91.97  * For the sensitivity analysis on account of attrition rate 50% of the  assumed attrition rate is considered. # For the sensitivity analysis on account of mortality rate 10% of the  assumed mortality rate is considered.

Accordingly, the Group’s risk management framework has the objective of ensuring that such  risks are managed within acceptable and approved risk parameters in a disciplined and consistent manner and in  compliance with applicable regulations. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate  skills, experience and supervision. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes  shall be undertaken. The Holding Company's management is supported by a risk management committee that advises on financial risks  and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group. The risk management committee provides  assurance to the Group’s management that the Group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies  and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies  and risk objectives. The Board of Directors reviews policies for managing each of these risks. A)   Market risk     Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risks a) commodity price risk b) currency risk and c)  interest rate risk. Financial instruments are affected by market risk comprise deposits, investments, trade payables.     The Group's investments are predominantly held in fixed deposits, liquid mutual funds and Government Securities.  Mark to market movements in respect of the Group's investments are valued through the Consolidated Statement  of Profit and Loss. Fixed deposits are held with highly rated banks and are not subject to interest rate volatility.   Assumption made in calculating the sensitivity analysis     The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks.  The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity and other  post-retirement obligations and provisions.   a)   Commodity price risk       Commodity price risk for the Group is mainly related to fluctuations in coal and pet coke prices linked to  various external factors, which can affect the production cost of the Group. Since the energy costs is one  of the primary costs drivers, any fluctuation in fuel prices can lead to a drop in operating margin. To manage  this risk, the Group take following steps:     i)    Optimising the fuel mix, pursue longer term and fixed contracts where considered necessary.     ii)      Consistent efforts to reduce the cost of power and fuel by using both domestic and international  coal and petcoke.     iii)      Use of alternative Fuel and Raw Materials (AFR) and enhancing the utilisation of renewable power  including its onsite and offsite solar, wind, hydro power and Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS).       Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management  and fuel requirements are monitored by the central procurement team.   b)   Foreign currency risk       Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in  foreign currency, which fluctuate due to change in foreign exchange rates. The Group's exposure to the  risk of changes in foreign exchange rates primarily relate to import of raw materials, fuels and capital items.   Based on sensitivity analysis, the Group has well defined forex exposure threshold limit approved by Board  of Directors, beyond which all forex exposure are fully hedged.

Such exposure is also controlled, reviewed and approved by the management of the Group on routine basis.  There are no indications that defaults in payment obligations would occur in respect of these financial assets.     Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents, deposits with the banks / financial institutions is generally low as the  said deposits have been made with the banks / financial institutions who have been assigned high credit rating  by international and domestic credit rating agencies.     Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved financial Institutions. Investments primarily include  investment in units of liquid mutual funds (debt market) and fixed deposits with banks having low credit risk.     Total non-current investments (other than subsidiaries and joint arrangements), investments in liquid mutual  funds and investments in Government securities as on March 31, 2025 are  I  28.96 crore,  I  2794.66 crore and    I  1822.16 crore (March 31, 2024 -  I  27.60 crore,  I  2,242.47 crore and  I  758.69).     Balances with banks were not past due or impaired as at year end. Other than the details disclosed below, other  financial assets are not past due and not impaired, there were no indications of default in repayment as at year end.   Incentives receivable from the Government     The Group has manufacturing units in various states; mainly those in Maharashtra, West Bengal and Jharkhand  are eligible for incentives under the respective State Industrial Policy. Group accrued these incentives as refund  claims in respect of VAT / GST paid, on the basis that all attaching conditions were fulfilled by the Group and there  was reasonable assurance that the incentive claims will be disbursed by the State Governments.     Group is confident about the ultimate realisation of the dues from the State Governments and there is no  risk of default.   Movement of Incentives under Government schemes I  in Crore As at April 01, 2023  1,498.24  Incentive accrued   359.25  Incentive received  (179.79) As at March 31, 2024 (Refer Note -13 and 21)  1,677.70  Incentive accrued  1,159.47  Deferred Government Grant  155.15  Incentive received   (799.67) As at March 31, 2025 (Refer Note -13 and 21)  2,192.65    Trade receivable     Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers. The Group has credit evaluation policy for each customer  and based on the evaluation credit limit of each customer is defined. The exposure in credit risk arising out of  major customers is generally backed either by bank guarantee, letter of credit or security deposits.     The Group's exposure and wherever appropriate, the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored  and spread amongst various counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed  and approved by the management of the Group.     The Group does not have higher concentration of credit risks since no single customer accounted for 10% or more  of the Group's net sales.    Total trade receivable as on March 31, 2025 is  I  1590.30 crore (March 31, 2024 -   I  1189.59 crore).   Refer Note 16 for ageing of trade receivables.   Expected credit loss assessment     The Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected loss allowance for financial assets based  on historical credit loss experience and adjustments for forward looking information. As per simplified approach,  the Group makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix to mitigate  the risk of default payments and makes appropriate provision at each reporting date wherever outstanding is for  longer period and involves higher risk.   Credit Impaired     For expected credit loss as at each reporting date the Group assesses position for the assets for which credit risk  has not significantly increased from initial recognition, assets for which credit risk has increased significantly but  are not credit impaired and for assets for which credit risk has increased significantly and are credit impaired.  The Group assesses detrimental impacts on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset including loans,  receivables and other assets. Based on the assessment of the observable data relating to significant financial  difficulty and creditworthiness of the counterparties, the management believes that there are no financial assets  which are credit impaired except as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

The Group’s treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management.  In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors  the Group’s liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. The Group has invested  in short term liquid funds and marketable government securities which can be redeemed on a very short notice  and hence carried negligible liquidity risk.

These deposits do not have a contractual re-payment term but are repayable on  demand. Since, the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the payment beyond 12 months from  reporting date, these deposits have been classified under current financial liabilities. For including these  amounts in the above mentioned maturity analysis, the Group has assumed that these deposits, including  interest thereon, will be repayable at the end of the next reporting period. The actual maturity period for the  deposit amount and the interest thereon can differ based on the date on which these deposits are settled  to the customers.   b)      Other financial liabilities includes Security deposit from dealers and others, Payable towards purchase  of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets (including hold and retention money),Purchase  consideration payable towards acquisition of Subsidiary and others (Refer Note 37). Note 60 - Segment reporting For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on the nature of the products, the differing  risks and returns. The organisation structure and internal reporting system has two reportable segments, as follows: (a)      Cement  -  Cement is a product which is obtained from clinker resulting from mixing the raw materials such as  limestone, clay, iron ore, fly ash, bauxite, etc, in determined ratios. Clinker is then mixed with certain amount of  setting regulator (generally gypsum) which is ground together and set after mixing with water and gains strength  to make Cement. In general, it is used in construction activities. (b)      Ready Mix Concrete -  Ready Mix Concrete is concrete that is manufactured in a batch plant, according to a set  engineered mix design. In general, it is used in construction activities. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) monitors the operating results of its business units separately for  the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance  is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the financial statements.  However, the Group’s financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a  Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions  with third parties.

We proactively implement measures to mitigate or manage these  conflicts, ensuring independence and impartiality in our assurance engagements. We provide clear and  transparent disclosures about any identified conflicts of interest in our assurance statemen t.
