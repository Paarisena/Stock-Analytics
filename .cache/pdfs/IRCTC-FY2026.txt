Extended Producer  Responsibility (EPR) Compliance As part our EPR commitment, we  have  adopted a structured system  for the collection, recycling and  disposal of plastic waste generated  through Rail Neer packaged drinking  water. Waste is channelled through  designated collection points and sent  to authorised vendors for processing.  This comprehensive system ensures our  adherence to regulatory requirements  under the EPR framework.

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The segment wise operational performance of the Company  during 2024-25 is detailed below: CATERING & HOSPITALITY The Catering and Hospitality segment of IRCTC is segregated  as produced below:   Mobile Catering:   IRCTC is dedicated to providing onboard catering services  to passengers traveling by train, ensuring convenient  access to quality food during their journey. These services  are offered through two main modes: pantry cars or mini  pantries equipped with onboard storage, reheating, and  cooling facilities.   In trains equipped with pantry cars or mini pantries, food  is prepared and stored with the help of onboard facilities,  allowing for fresh meals to be served to passengers  throughout the journey Catering &    Hospitality e-Catering Static Catering Mobile Catering Mobile Catering 	 ¾ Vande Bharat, Gatiman    & Tejas Trains 	 ¾ Rajdhani, Shatabdi    & Duronto Trains 	 ¾ Mail Express Trains 	 ¾ Train side Vending Pantry car  51

Train-Side Vending:     A significant number of Mail and Express trains do not  have pantry cars or mini pantries onboard. To ensure  uninterrupted catering services in such trains, IRCTC  facilitates onboard food service through the Train  Side Vending (TSV) arrangement.

This efficient mechanism allows  IRCTC to extend catering services to a wider network  of trains, maintaining the quality and convenience  expected by travellers.      As on March 31, 2025, IRCTC provided onboard  catering through Train Side Vending in 701 trains,  either on a sectional basis or end-to-end routes.

For  Mail and Express trains, monitoring is carried out on a  sectional basis. Mini-pantry 52 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

It also has the major potential to contribute  to the local economy. India being diverse in landscapes,  cuisines, heritage, adventure, wildlife and culture has  emerged as a well-known destination for both overseas  and domestic travellers in the recent years. Since Tourism  is an integral part of the economy, various development  initiatives have been taken up by the Ministry of Tourism,  Government of India from time to time. 57 

	   Emerging Markets:     Emerging Markets, particularly India, are expected to  play a crucial role in driving this growth.  	   India's Potential:     WTTC projects India's Travel & Tourism sector to  grow from a GDP contribution of  B  21.15 TN in 2024  to potentially  B  43.25 TN by 2034, supporting nearly  63 million jobs.    The growing influence of the Tourism Sector as an  Economic Powerhouse and its potential as a tool for  development are irrefutable. Not only does the tourism  sector spearhead growth, it also improves the quality of  people’s lives with its capacity to generate large scale  employment of diverse kind. It supports environmental  protection, champions diverse cultural heritage and  strengthens peace & harmony in the world.   Facilitation as well as strengthening of tourism in India  is the main objective of Ministry of Tourism. Augmenting  Tourism Infrastructure, easing of Visa Regime, assurance of  Quality Standards in services of Tourism Service Providers,  projection of the country as a 365 days’ tourist destination,  promotion of sustainable tourism etc. are some of the  policy areas which need to be constantly worked upon to  increase and facilitate tourism in India.

Among economically  advanced states, Domestic Tourism has become the  key driving factor to the development of tourism. It can  generate resources for conservation of Cultural and  Natural Heritage and has a huge potential to make a  positive contribution to sustainable development goals  of tourist destinations. As per the 3 rd  Tourism Satellite  Account (TSA), the study conducted by Ministry of Tourism,  estimated share of Tourism jobs in India during 2022-23  was 12.57%.

Identification, diversification, development, and promotion  of niche tourism products in the country is the initiative of  the Ministry to overcome the aspect of ‘seasonality’ and to  promote India as a 365 days’ destination, to attract tourists  with specific interests, and to ensure repeat visits to the  destinations in which India has a comparative advantage.  The following niche products have been identified for  development and promotion of Adventure, Meetings,  Incentives Conferences & Exhibitions (MICE), Sustainable  Tourism, Rural Tourism, Medical and Wellness Tourism,  Eco-Tourism, Golf and Cruise Tourism amongst others.

The  train list once selected under VIKALP can be changed or  updated only once. j.

Activated carbon filtration Stage 1 & 2 –  Stage 1  removes dust, dead microbes, odour/colour and stage 2  is for removing pesticides. 2.   Auto Softening -  Hardness of water is removed by ion  exchange process.   Ultra filtration -  Colloidal, suspended particles and pyrogenic  species are filtered out through Ultra Filtration membranes. 3.   Reverse osmosis -  All dissolved impurities are removed.  Anti scaling agent not used. (All competitors use it to  enhances membrane life) 4.   Marble chip/ Calcite filtration -  To boost "pH" - Exclusive  process adopted by Rail Neer. 5.   Two-stage micron filtration -   Impurities with size more  than 0.2 micron are filtered out. 75 

6.   UV sterilization -  UV-light causes change in the genetic  material of micro organisms and thus prevents them  from reproducing. 7.   Ozonation-  Water comes in contact with ozone gas for  final disinfection from the micro organisms. The nascent  oxygen is powerful oxidizing agent and kills the microbes.   This system ensures removal of physical, chemical, and  biological contaminants, delivering water that meets the  highest safety standards. Bottle Manufacturing: High-grade PET preforms are converted into bottles using  fully automatic blowing machines. This minimizes manual  intervention, ensuring consistent bottle quality and hygiene. Rinsing, Filling, and Capping: Bottles are air-conveyed to automatic RFC (Rinsing, Filling &  Capping) machine. Bottles are rinsed using high-pressure jets,  filled using precision nozzles, and capped in a controlled 20°C  environment—ensuring superior product integrity. Outlook and Growth Strategy: IRCTC’s current production capacity is around 17.68 lakh litres/ day, spread over nineteen working plants. With the likely  commissioning of one more plant at Mallavalli near Vijayawada  (Andhra Pradesh) July,2024, capacity will be enhanced to  approx. 18.40 lakh litres/day. Facility for production of 500 ml Rail Neer Packaged Drinking  Water is being developed in 18 Rail Neer Plants. The 500 ml  bottles are being supplied in Shatabdi and Vande Bharat trains.  Also, this will be sold on Railway Station premises. HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT During FY 2024-25,  IRCTC reaffirmed its commitment to  fostering a transparent, responsive, and employee-centric  work environment by advancing digital transformation  across its Human Resource functions . The year marked  a strategic shift towards automation of processes and  streamlining of HR policies, with a focus on enhancing  employee convenience, improving organizational efficiency,  and strengthening governance standards. Several online modules were developed and implemented to  digitize critical HR processes, including modules for medical  card issuance, employee grievance redressal, passport  NOC requests, and D&AR clearances. Additionally, the “Talk  to Management” initiative was redeveloped with improved  functionality to foster open and direct communication  between employees and senior leadership. The Performance  Management System (PMS) was also extended to E7 and E8  level officers through an online platform, enabling performance  tracking aligned with institutional goals. These initiatives not only improved service delivery and reduced  processing time but also empowered employees by offering  greater transparency and ease of access to HR services.

With ongoing emphasis on employee engagement,  health, safety, upskilling, and well-being, the Human Resource  Department has made great strides towards creating a  vibrant, inclusive, and caring environment of work. Building  upon the framework of employee welfare of past years, some  digital and welfare-centric initiatives were initiated this year,  signaling a movement towards an integrated, transparent, and  technologically driven HR ecosystem. During the year under review, the Company sustained its  strategic drive toward digital transformation by progressively  replacing manual systems with electronic solutions. These  efforts were aligned with the overarching objective of enhancing  operational efficiency, transparency, and employee enablement.  A number of in-house developed software applications were  successfully designed, tested, and implemented across key  functional domains, contributing significantly to administrative  simplification and governance improvement. New Initiatives Rolled Out during FY 2024–25 1.   Digital Transformation of HR Services: 	   Medical Card Issuance (HRMS Module):  IRCTC  implemented an end-to-end digital Medical Card  Issuance system through the HRMS portal ( https:// ess.irctc.com ). The module enables employees to  apply for fresh medical cards, renew, and modify card  details in the case of transfers or promotions. The  online process has eliminated paperwork, reduced  processing time, and ensures that employees and  their families continue receiving uninterrupted  medical services irrespective of location or  designation changes. 	   Online Employee Grievance Redressal:  To  streamline grievance redressal and make it more  employee-centric, IRCTC introduced an online  grievance redressal platform. This module allows  for centralized grievance registration, tracking,  and solution. Through a transparent process, now  employees can keep track of their progress, get  responses on time, and escalate unresolved cases  through an integrated and accountable process. 	   Re-launch of Passport NOC Module Post Technical  Enhancements:  Following initial user feedback and  identification of technical issues, the Passport NOC  module was upgraded and successfully re-launched.  Enhancements included: 	   Improved user experience and bug resolution. 	   Integration with employee profiles for faster  data retrieval. 	   Conducting internal training sessions for HR  users across zones to ensure smooth adoption. 	   D&AR Clearance Module:  An online D&AR  (Discipline and Appeal Rules) clearance module was  implemented to provide for timely and traceable  clearance of passport-related cases, foreign travel,  outside employment, and other official demands. The  system electronically channels requests to related  departments for verification, keeping records in  secure and traceable form, with a marked reduction  in turnaround times and administrative labor. 	   Talk to Management Portal:  The “Talk to  Management” interface was enhanced to provide  a more formalized and interactive platform for  employees to put forward recommendations, ideas,  and comments in direct communication with top  management. As opposed to the grievance redressal  system, this module is designed to encourage  a culture of communication and involvement,  wherein employees are able to contribute towards  organizational growth. The module also features a  tracking tool to track the status of their submissions. 	   APAR for E7 & E8 Grades:  To automate and harmonize  the performance appraisal process, an in-house new  APAR (Annual Performance Appraisal Report) module  was created for E7 and E8 grade officers. The module  77 

spans the complete appraisal process right from self- appraisal to review and final submission—all through  an online secure and effective workflow. This has  improved timeliness, transparency, and precision in  the performance review process. 	   Marriage Gift Claim Module:  The procedure for  claiming marriage gifts was computerized to simplify  and speed up the disbursal of benefits. Employees  are now able to apply online for the benefit with  the system automatically checking eligibility and  settling the claim. This has cut paperwork by leaps  and bounds, infused transparency, and speeded up  approvals with ease while keeping correct digital  records for audit and reference purposes. 	   Expansion of HRMS Features:  There were  constant enhancements to the HRMS portal for  increasing its usefulness and ease of use. Several  features for leave management, transfer application,  employee data updates, and circulars regarding  company policies were combined into a single  interface. These enhancements have contributed  to the portal becoming a one-stop solution for the  majority of the needs of HR, minimizing reliance on  manual interventions and fostering a digital self- service culture. 2.   Health, Safety, and Social Security Measures:   IRCTC has been providing free consultation services to  the employees of Corporate Offic and North Zone by  empaneling General Physician, Gynecologist & AYUSH  physicians. Carrying forward the efforts of FY 2023–24,  empanelment of in-house doctors continued to extend  accessible primary healthcare to the employees.   Expansion of coverage under the Group Life Insurance  Scheme, IRCTC has extended the coverage with monetary  limit of 70 months basic pay plus dearness allowance for  all employees of IRCTC, ensuring financial protection in  the event of natural or accidental death.    Grant of Ex-gratia amount of  H 25,000/- to dependent  family members of the deceased employees as funeral  expenses, Compassionate ground appointments to the  next of kin of deceased employee, and continuation  of the Post-Retirement Medical Scheme for the retired  employees demonstrate IRCTC’s social security focus for  active as well as retired employees.   Medical Health Check-up of Spouse of the Employee: As  a welfare measure for its employees, IRCTC has recently  started the facility for Optional Preventive Medical Health  Check-up of Spouse of the employees who has crossed a  certain age (45 years in case of males and 40 years in case  of females). This scheme will be helpful for the spouse of  the employees to get their regular preventive health check- ups and medical treatments. Further, extending this facility  to the dependent determines the IRCTC’s investment in  the creation of healthy workforce; and it can be seen as an  investment in the well-being and protection of employees  & their family, which will result in improved performance,  productivity, and loyalty.  3.   Apprenticeship Engagement   Consistent with the Ministry of Skill Development &  Entrepreneurship, 73 apprentices were engaged during  FY 2023–24 (4.07% of total strength). The program  extends to FY 2024–25 with more emphasis on industry- ready skill building, where 97 apprentices were engaged  which is approximately 5.12% of the total employee  strength against the minimum engagement of 2.5% as per  the Government guidelines.  4.   Prime Minister Internship Scheme (PMIS):   IRCTC successfully implemented the first phase of the  Prime Minister Internship Scheme (PMIS), an initiative by  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs aimed at enhancing youth  employability by providing practical exposure in a Corporate  environment. Out of approximately 1000 applications  received for 500 internship positions, 117 candidates were  shortlisted across key functional areas such as Tourism, IT,  HR, Finance, Legal, and Catering. However, 33 candidates  joined on internship under this scheme in IRCTC. The  scheme not only enabled young individuals to gain  valuable hands-on experience but also helped IRCTC tap  into fresh talent and innovative perspectives.    Following the encouraging response and outcomes of the  initial phase, IRCTC launched the second phase of PMIS in  2025, targeting the engagement of 467 interns across its  six regional zones and corporate office. IRCTC also decided  to pay a stipend of  H 5000/- per month additional to the  monetary remuneration in the form of stipend being paid  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the PMIS scheme.  The continued execution of this scheme reflects IRCTC’s  strong commitment to supporting the national agenda of  skill development and preparing a future-ready workforce  through structured, real-world learning opportunities.   Steps and Initiatives taken by IRCTC for Health & Safety  Improvements of Human Resources in CPSEs:   IRCTC recognizes that the health and safety of its  employees are of paramount importance. In alignment  with the Government of India’s mandate and the directives  issued by the Railway Board, IRCTC has proactively taken  several steps to improve the well-being of its workforce.  The organization regularly conducts training sessions,  workshops, and webinars on various health and safety- related topics to enhance awareness and promote a  culture of health consciousness among employees. 78 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

Travel and tourism industry in India Tourism and Hospitality have emerged as one of the pivotal  sectors within India's Service Industry, significantly contributing  to the nation's economic development and cultural exchange  between diverse communities. India's diverse offerings ranging  from cultural and natural heritage, spiritual retreats to adventure  tourism has positioned it as one of the prominent destinations  for both domestic and international travellers. Current Landscape and Growth Projections: 	   Revenue Generation:  In 2024, India's tourism industry  is projected to have generated approximately $24  billion, marking a notable increase from previous years.  This growth is attributed to enhanced infrastructure,  government initiatives and a surge in both domestic and  international travel. 	   Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs):  The first half of 2024  witnessed 4.78 million foreign tourist arrivals indicating a  steady recovery from the pandemic-induced downturn.  Projections suggest that by 2028, FTAs could reach 30.5  million driven by improved connectivity and targeted  marketing efforts. Sectoral Highlights and Developments: 	   Government Initiatives:  Programs like ‘Swadesh Darshan’  and ‘PRASHAD’ (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual  Augmentation Drive) aim to develop tourism infrastructure,  while campaigns such as ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ and ‘Chalo  India’ promote domestic travel. 	   Niche Tourism Growth:  Segments like medical and  wellness tourism are experiencing significant growth.  India’s medical tourism sector was valued at $9 billion  in 2022 and is projected to reach $13 billion by 2026,  attracting patients from across the globe.  	   Challenges and Strategic Focus:  While the tourism  sector shows promising growth, various challenges such  as burden on existing infrastructure, carrying capacity of  destinations, environmental concerns and geopolitical  tensions can impact tourism dynamics. Strategic focus  on sustainable practices, infrastructure development  and geopolitical stability will continue to be crucial in  maintaining and enhancing India’s position as a leading  global tourism destination.  India’s Travel &Tourism Sector: 	   In the 2024 TTDI (Travel and Tourism Development Index),  published by ‘World Economic Forum’, India ranked 39 th   globally.

Digitalisation in the tourism sector:  It’s insightful to see how India’s rich tourism potential  intersects with the global movement towards digitalization and  sustainability in 2025. India is actively embracing technological  advancements and sustainable practices to enhance its  tourism sector. The updated perspective on digitalization in Indian Tourism for  2025 is elaborated below: 1.   India’s Tourism Business in 2025 is witnessing a dynamic  shift, fuelled by the increasing integration of digital  technologies. Imagine planning your trip to India, not just  through static brochures, but via immersive  virtual reality  (VR)  tours that lets one experience the grandeur of the  famous monuments in various parts of the country, Taj  Mahal or the serene backwaters of Kerala from your home.  This is becoming a reality offering potential tourists a vivid  preview and inspiring their travel decisions. 2.   Artificial Intelligence (AI)  is no longer a futuristic concept  but a tangible tool enhancing the travel experience.  Picture AI-powered chatbots and  smart phones with  AR applications are providing historical information of  monuments including 3D view and interactive guided tours  as personal travel assistants, offering  hyper-personalized  recommendations  for destinations, activities and even  culinary experiences based on your preferences and  past travel history. These intelligent systems can handle  complex queries, manage bookings seamlessly and  provide 24/7 support making travel planning smoother  and more efficient. 3.   The  Incredible India Digital Platform (IIDP) of Ministry  of Tourism  has been revamped leveraging AI to provide  tailored experiences, real-time updates on weather and  local events and seamless booking services in partnership  with various Online Travel Agents (OTAs). This platform  acts as a central hub connecting travellers with the diverse  offerings of India in a user-friendly digital environment. 4.   Contactless travel,  accelerated by the need for  hygiene and convenience, is becoming the norm. Digital  payments through UPI are seamlessly extending into the  tourism sector, simplifying transactions across the travel  ecosystem.  Biometric systems  are also being explored  94 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

Statutory Reports for airport check-ins and hotel access promising smoother  and more secure processes. 5.   Data analytics  plays a crucial role in understanding  traveller behaviour and preferences allowing tourism  businesses to offer more targeted marketing campaigns  and personalized experiences. This data-driven approach  helps optimize pricing, forecast demand and tailor services  to meet evolving traveller needs. 6.   Sustainable solutions  are also being amplified through  technology. AI can assist in monitoring pollution levels at  historical sites and managing crowd density in ecologically  sensitive areas. Digital platforms are promoting eco- friendly accommodations and experiences catering to the  growing number of travellers who prioritize sustainability. The Government is actively supporting this digital transformation  with initiatives like the development of 50 top tourist destinations  in the country under various schemes with enhanced digital  infrastructure and the promotion of digital payment solutions  across the tourism sector. Schemes like Swadesh Darshan 2.0  also focus on developing eco-friendly tourism models that align  with international sustainability goals, often incorporating digital  tools for better management and visitor engagement. In essence, digitalization in Indian tourism in 2025 is about  creating a more personalized, immersive, convenient and  sustainable travel experience for the tourists to enjoy and  get involved. Technology is bridging the gap between India’s  rich tourism offerings and the evolving expectations of  modern travelers promising a more seamless and enriching  journey for all.

Through this platform one can discover destinations, plan  itineraries, book travel and accommodations, access real- time information, and even get assistance during one’s trip.  The ongoing development focuses on integrating various  services and utilizing AI for personalized experiences. 	   National Integrated Database of Hospitality Industry  (NIDHI):  This technology-driven system has been  designed to digitalize and promote ease of doing business  for the Hospitality and Tourism sector. The system provides  information of not only just accommodation facilities but  also information about Travel Agents, Tour Operators  and other stakeholders, creating a comprehensive digital  ecosystem of hospitality information.    	   Support for Start-ups in Tourism:  Recognizing the  role of innovation, the government is promoting and  supporting start-ups in the tourism sector through various  schemes and collaborations. This initiative will foster  the development of new technologies and solutions to  enhance the travel experience.    Capacity Building and Skill Development: 	   Incredible India Tourist Facilitator Certification  Programme:  This digital initiative aims to create a large  pool of certified and skilled tourist guides for eliciting  information to tourists about destinations with well guided  and informed tours.

Financial Assistance and Incentives: 	   The government provides financial assistance to State  Governments and Union Territories for developing Tourism  Infrastructure, organizing fairs and festivals and promoting  tourism-related events.    	   Schemes offering incentives for the development of hotels,  resorts, and other tourism projects in specific regions have  also been implemented.    In essence, the Indian government’s approach of bolstering the  tourism industry in 2025 is a multi-pronged strategy that not only  focuses on infrastructure development and promotion but also  deeply integrates digitalization and sustainability in the tourism  business. The aim is to create a more accessible, personalized,  safe and enriching travel experience for everyone while  preserving India’s rich cultural and natural heritage for the future  generations to witness.

Also, this will be sold on Railway Station premises Risk management  Risk description  Mitigation strategy  Foreign exchange risk  Fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates can impact  the performance of IRCTC’s Internet Ticketing and  Tourism business. Tariffs are calculated in USD with a lower Return on Equity (ROE)to ensure  stability and avoid frequent revisions. Banks convert foreign exchange transactions to INR and credit IRCTC’s  account with the prevailing exchange rate on the remittance date. The exchange rate for booking packages in USD is set higher than the  RBI’s monthly average ROE. In circumstances of frequent volatility, an  upper limit on the exchange rate is imposed.  ROE is kept above the RBI’s average ROE to mitigate potential foreign  exchange losses. This approach is frequently used for booking packages  for overseas clients or agents. Competition risk Entry of the private sector in the industry can compel  IRCTC to lose its market exclusivity. Its operational  efficiency and profit margins will be negatively  impacted by increased competition. A strong and agile management team effectively drives strategic growth,  enabling IRCTC to outperform private competition. 110 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

Statutory Reports Risk description  Mitigation strategy  Regulation risk IRCTC’s operations and profitability depend on the  Government policies. Failing to abide by the policy  changes will negatively impact the Company’s  operations. The Company provides various products and services to the public on  behalf of Indian Railways under the authorisation of the Government.  Being the preferred vendor for railway services offers business continuity  and regular revenue assurance. Business continuity risk Nearly 80% of the train reservations are done online.  Any major failure or disaster at Primary Data Centre  or non-availability of Business Continuity Planning  (BCP) can pose risk for the Company. During the reported year, a budget of INR 221 Cr was sanctioned to  implement a Disaster Recovery (DR) Site for NGeT System. Rail Neer operations risk Challenges in raw materials procurement and  insufficient storage facilities can obstruct the  Company’s ability to meet the market demand. The Company has arranged multiple sources for procuring raw materials.  Along with this, storage is managed strategically based on seasonal  demand, ensuring continuous supply and timely delivery. Catering operations risk 1.   The Ministry of Railways frequently changes its  catering policy. 2.   A significant number of complaints have been  received over time involving unauthorised  vending.  3.   Maintaining sanitation in food units, such as  pantry cars, is challenging due to their location  on platforms and the movement of trains around  the country.  4.   Non-functional pantry and mini-pantry car  equipment, posing a food contamination risk 5.   Zonal Railways is taking up stations under the  ABSS scheme. 1.   The Ministry has been asked to give adequate time for policy  implementation. 2.   To prevent unauthorised vending, awareness campaigns concerning  rates and menu items are being implemented through social and print  media, along with continuous monitoring. Law enforcement agencies  have requested assistance from the railway. 3.   A hospitality supervisor is being employed to monitor mobile units.  Regular food safety audits are conducted in addition to training  provided. CCTV cameras are increasingly being installed in kitchens.  Third-party audits are being conducted to assess the hygiene and  standards of these units. 4.   Railways are routinely advised on the status of non-working  equipment to ensure vital equipment availability in all micro pantry  cars and timely maintenance. 5.   The Railway Board and zonal Railways have been invited to establish  timetables for station refurbishment and control of significant catering  assets. Product quality risk The catering and food services need to follow  government-approved quality standards. Failure to  abide by these standards will impact the Company’s  performance. A trained food safety team ensures rigorous quality controls and  compliance with the food safety and quality standards. Hygiene risk Inadequate sanitation at the catering units can  compromise the Company’s operational efficiency  and brand image. Maintenance of hygiene standards and food safety remains the prime  focus of the Company’s catering units. It undertakes various initiatives  such as conducting sanitisation training, continuous surveillance and  regular audits to ensure food safety. Additionally, IRCTC also ensures  cleanliness and hygiene within the trains and platforms. Reputation risk Negative publicity or media crises can damage the  Company’s public image. An experienced PR team handles crises professionally. Active social  media monitoring and proactive press releases ensure timely clarification  to fight against any misconceptions. IT risk Weak IT infrastructure can lead to security breaches,  undermining customer trust and operational  reliability.  Advanced security systems are developed to safeguard data integrity  and privacy. The Company also conducts regular information security  audits of NGeT system through CERT-In empanelled information security  audit agencies, thereby, supporting its aim to maintain data privacy. Technology risk Integrating advanced technology is essential to  support a large volume of ticket bookings. Failure to  ensure this can impact the Company’s image. IRCTC integrates advanced technologies, ensuring efficiency and  supporting heavy traffic with its superior capacity. The Company also  maintains a backup system for seamless operations. 111 

Internal control systems – process excellence  The Company maintains rigorous internal controls to mitigate  risks, particularly in financial accounting, reporting and  operational processes, ensuring strict compliance with legal  and regulatory requirements. These Internal Controls (ICs)  measures, including thorough reviews, approvals, physical  counts and segregation of duties, are aimed at strengthening  the systems, preventing errors and detecting irregularities.  To ensure adherence to these standards, the Company has  engaged an independent external firm, comprising Chartered  Accountants, as Internal Auditor. The internal audit assignments  are carried out on a half-yearly basis. The Internal Audit team  carries out extensive audits throughout the year covering each  and every aspect of the business. The Company has also hired  another firm of Chartered Accountants to issue the Independent  Auditor’s Report on the Internal Financial Controls over Financial  Reporting for the Company in accordance with Clause (i) of sub- section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013. The report  issued thereupon has been attached along with the Financial  Statements. The Audit Committee reviews the internal control  systems with the Internal Auditor and Statutory Auditor before  the Financial Statements are placed before it for recommending  to the Board for approval Disclaimer  There may be some forward-looking statements in the MDA  section about potential future developments. These statements  involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could  materially affect final results. Macro-environmental changes  may pose unanticipated, unexpected, unknowable and ever  evolving risk(s) to the Company and the environment in which  it operates. The conclusions of these assumptions, which  are based on information that is both internal and externally  available, constitute the basis for some of the facts and numbers  in the study. The estimations on which these assumptions are  based are similarly for an on behalf of the Board of Directors.

It may be noted that Railway follows cash system  of accounting while IRCTC follows accrual system  of accounting. Also, a huge number of ongoing  transactions take place between IRCTC and Railways  on daily basis. To resolve the issue, regular meetings  are held with Zonal Railways for reconciliation of  Payable/Receivable and the minutes of the meetings  are also issued accordingly. Further, during FY 2024- 25, reconciliation meetings of zonal Railways & IRCTC  zonal offices have also been held at Railway Board.

Point 9 of   Emphasis  of Matter &  point 5(ii) of  Annexure-1  to audit  report Note No. 78 regarding:  (i)   Differences between certain subsidiary and control  ledger balances which are under process for  identification, reconciliation and adjustments, if any,  as on March 31, 2025, (ii)   review and improvement of system of identification  and disclosure of trade payables including MSME  suppliers and their classification into Micro, Small  and Medium category to ensure proper disclosure  of their dues in Consolidated Financial Statements  as on March 31, 2025 which needs improvement by  way of confirmations from such parties. The differential entries reported pertain to the  post-migration phase. Several discrepancies have  already been identified and rectified. The process of  passing the necessary rectification entries is currently  underway and is expected to be completed during  the financial year 2025–26. The system of identification of liabilities as trade  payables and their aging will be revisited and improved  in FY 2025-26 as this is a continuous process. Additionally, during the current financial year,  categorization of vendors under Micro, Small, and  Medium Enterprises (MSME) has been carried  out within the ERP system to enable appropriate  segmentation and compliance. Point 10 of   Emphasis of  Matter (a)   Note No. 76 regarding enhancement of charges  for operation of two Tejas trains by the Railway  Board, Ministry of Railways with effect from August  13, 2021 vide its letter dated June 05, 2023 as  the earlier instructions for charges were valid till  August 12, 2021. During the year ended March  31, 2024, the Company has made provision for  enhanced charges with effect from August 13, 2021  for the period up to March 31, 2023 amounting to  H  5,126.20 Lakhs and shown as an “Exceptional  Item’ in the financial results. However, the Company  has made representation to the Railway Board All  for withdrawal of these instructions for enhanced  charges from retrospective effect which is pending. (b)   Exceptional items include  H  220.72 lakhs towards the  reversal of RU, stabling and other charges waived  off on Golden Chariot train by KTDC for the previous  Financial Year 2022-23 and of  H  3,988.09 lakhs  towards net Impact of one-time reconciliation of  Legacy balances. The Company had made representation to the  Railway Board and had requested that the charging  principle for operation of Tejas trains by IRCTC  issued in June 2023 may kindly be made effective  from prospective effect only as implementation  with retrospective effect would result into loss. The  response from Railways is awaited.  During the year ended 31 st  March 2025, the Company  carried out a one-time reconciliation exercise to  identify and resolve legacy balances that had  remained unadjusted over time. These balances  had accumulated primarily due to reconciliation  difficulties faced during the earlier transition from  the Conventional Accounting System to the New  Accounting System. The net impact of this reconciliation was a gain,  primarily from the write-back of liabilities, and has  been shown as an Exceptional Item in the Statement  of Profit and Loss for the year ended 31 st  March 2025.  166 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

Statutory Reports Point in the  Auditor’s  Report Auditor’s Remarks Management Replies Point 5 (i) of  Annexure-1  to audit  report Maker and checker concept, which is an important  internal financial control, is generally missing i.e. not  being implemented resulting in number of errors and  omissions in financial and other data based on which  transactions are recorded in books of account. Company  needs to strengthen more professional staff. The Company has hired qualified professionals on  contract basis to address the issues. Some system  based restrictions have also been placed in ERP to  control the errors and omissions. Point 5(iv) of  Annexure-1  to audit  report Manual controls are followed instead of system-based  automated controls, checks and balances as the  transactions executed through 3 rd  party applications /  portals are posted manually in ERP by compiling data  through Excel as the existing ERP application is not  integrated with certain functions / segments of the  Group. The ERP team is working in close coordination with  the concerned stakeholders to compile the sourced  data required for seamless integration.

Our engagement scope was  specifically focused on the verification of dis closed BRSR Core indicators and did not extend to evaluating IRCTC's  strategic ESG frameworks, management effectiveness of sustainability initiatives, or comprehensive assessment  beyond the defined nine attributes specified in  Annexure I  -   Format of BRSR Core .   Our  p rofessional  o bligations  i nclude:   •   Designing assurance procedures to achieve reasonable confidence that BRSR Core attributes are materially  accurate and complete   •   Developing objective conclusions through evidence - based sampling and verification methodologies   •   Communicating our professional opinion directly to IRCTC's Board of Directors with clear methodology  disclosure   Assurance Framework  Follows :   •   International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised)  -   Assurance Engagements Other  than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information   •   SEBI BRSR Core Guidance Document   •   National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles   Our procedures were designed to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the accuracy of BRSR Core indicators,  recognizing that reasonable assurance provides high confidence while acknowledging inherent limitations in  detecting all potential misstatements.   This professional engagement is conducted with the fundamental assumption that IRCTC's presented data and  information maintain integrity and are substantially free from material misrepresentation.     ASSURANCE METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES   •   Understanding IRCTC's business model, organizational structure, and operational processes   •   Identifying material BRSR Core indicators and assessing inherent risks   •   Evaluating internal controls over sustainability data collection and reporting   •   Performed  Verification   Activities (29 th   July -   4 th   August, 2025)   ❖   On - site Assessment -   29 th   & 31 st   July, 2025: Corporate Office Delhi, Rail Neer Plant Nangloi, Zonal Office  Delhi   ❖   On - Desk Assessment  -   30 th   July   &   1 st   -   4 t h   August, 2025 : All   37   operational sites   •   Examination of source documents, policies, procedures, invoices, utility bills, waste disposal certificates,  employee records, and management information systems   210 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

Where site - specific or monthl y data was unavailable, representative averages  from comparable operational sites have been applied using conservative estimation methodologies   •   Solar Energy:   Renewable energy consumption verified from solar bills and records.     LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS   The  assurance   scope was limited to the nine BRSR Core indicators as specifically mandated by SEBI guidelines,  thereby excluding broader sustainability disclosures. Forward - looking statements, strategic commitments, and  future targets were excluded from the verification   process as they represent management intentions rather than  historical performance data. Joint venture and subsidiary operations fell outside the defined verification  boundary, maintaining focus on IRCTC's standalone operational control. The  engagement involved reliance on  management representations for certain data points where independent third - party verification was not  operationally feasible or cost - effective.   Exclusions from Environmental Data:   •   Fugitive emissions from fire extinguishing systems are excluded due to minimal contribution to overall  emissions and operational safety requirements   •    C  ompany - owned vehicle fleet emissions  ex cluded as IRCTC does not maintain owned vehicle fleet for  operations   •   Minor refrigerant leakages from air conditioning systems at offices are excluded due to difficulties in  accurate measurement and minimal materiality     AREAS FOR ENHANCEMENT   The following improvement areas are identified for IRCTC's consideration, aligned with the organization's  sustainability objectives:   ❖   Consider pursuing ISO 45001:2018 certification across operational facilities to strengthen occupational  health and safety management systems   ❖   Implement comprehensive  third - party  water audits across all plant operations to establish accurate  measurement protocols, maintain systematic logbooks, and capture multiple parameters that will enhance  data precision for water consumption monitoring and production process optimization   ❖   Explore opportunities for wastewater recycling systems and rainwater harvesting infrastructure across Rail  Neer plants and major operational facilities to enhance water security   ❖   Consider developing Scope 3 emissions inventory following ISO 14064 standards to encompass value chain  emissions     Statutory Reports 211 

6   www.wireconsultancy.com         INDEPENDENCE AND COMPETENCE   WIRE Consultancy maintains complete independence  and as required by SEBI circular  SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD - SEC - 2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12/07/2023 , WIRE confirms no conflict of interest exists with IRCTC. The assurance team  adheres to fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, due care, and confidentiality.     WIRE operated as an independent third - party ESG assurance provider with qualified environmental and social  specialists. During the reporting period, no engagements were undertaken with IRCTC that could compromise  independence or impartiality. WIRE was not  involved in BRSR content preparation except for this assurance  statement and maintained complete impartiality during all stakeholder interviews.     CONCLUSION   Based on our procedures described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that IRCTC's  BRSR Core indicators for FY 2024 - 25 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the SEBI BRSR  Core framework and related gu idance.   The disclosed nine BRSR Core attributes provide fair representation and meet the content and quality  requirements of SEBI's BRSR Core format. The underlying data collection and reporting systems demonstrate  reliability and completeness. IRCTC's BRSR compli es with key requirements including governance oversight,  stakeholder responsiveness, materiality coverage, and information connectivity as specified in SEBI guidelines.   Based on SEBI's reasonable assurance requirements, including scope definition, risk - based methodologies, and  data validation techniques, we conclude that the BRSR Core disclosures are materially accurate and reliable,  supporting stakeholder confidence and  ESG reporting transparency.   Other Matters   IRCTC demonstrates strong commitment to sustainability reporting excellence with appropriate governance  structures supporting reliable ESG data management. The organization maintains effective internal quality  assurance processes with transparent stakehold er engagement mechanisms. This assurance statement should be  read in conjunction with IRCTC's complete Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for FY 2024 - 25.     For WIRE Consultancy       M s.

Independent Auditors’ Report To the Members of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial  Statements of  Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation  Limited  (“the Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as  at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including  Other Comprehensive Income), the Cash Flow Statement and the  Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended and Notes  to the Standalone Financial Statements, including a summary of  material accounting policies and other explanatory information  (hereinafter referred to as “Standalone Financial Statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to  the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial  Statements give the information required by the Companies Act,  2013, as amended, (“the Act”) in the manner so required and  give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting  Standards (“Ind AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the Act  read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) Rules,  2015, as amended, and other accounting principles generally  accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at  March 31, 2025, its profit (financial performance including other  comprehensive income), its cash flows and the changes in equity  for the year ended on that date. Basis of Opinion We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs)  specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities  under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements section of our report. We are independent of the  Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by  the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with  the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the  financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the  Rules made there under, and we have fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the  Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion on the standalone financial statements. Emphasis of Matter We draw attention to: 1.   Note No. 37.2(iv) regarding Arbitration award pronounced  in April 2022 amounting to  H  7,471.65 Lakhs plus simple  interest @ 6% per annum from January 2018 onwards,  given in favour of certain licensees which represents  principal amount towards claims for supply of welcome  drinks not paid to licensees and recovery of differential  costs for the supply of regular meals to the passengers on  the instructions of Railways whereas the price of combo  meal, which is lower than the price of regular meal, was  reimbursed to these licensees.

Key Audit Matter Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements of the current period. These  matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements as a whole and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  these matters. We have determined the matter described below  to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report. Assessment of litigation and related disclosure  of contingent liabilities Refer to Note No. 2 (c) to the Standalone Financial Statements  – Use of estimates and judgements-Provisions, Contingent  liabilities and Contingent assets and Note No. 37.2 to the  Standalone Financial Statements for “Contingent Liabilities”  and other significant litigations stated therein. As at March 31, 2025, the Company has exposures towards  number of litigations relating to various matters as set out in  the aforesaid Note. Significant management’s judgement is required to assess such  matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material  outflow of economic resources and whether a provision should  be made. The judgement is also supported with legal advice in  certain material cases as considered appropriate. As the ultimate outcome of the litigations are uncertain and  the position taken by the management are based on the  application of their best judgement which may be subject to  management bias, related legal advice including those relating  to interpretation of laws/regulations, we have identified this as  a Key Audit Matter. How our audit addressed the key audit matter Our audit procedures included the following: 	   We understood, assessed and tested the design and  operating effectiveness of key controls surrounding  assessment of litigations relating to the relevant laws  and regulations; 	   We read and considered latest orders / awards by various  courts / authorities on these matters; 	   We conducted detailed discussions with in-house  legal head, tax consultants and senior management  to understand their assessment on the most likely  outcome of the material litigations and to understand  the basis considered for the provisions made towards  these litigations; 	   We performed our assessment on a test basis on the  underlying calculations supporting the contingent  liabilities/other significant litigations disclosed in the  Standalone Financial Statements; 	   We considered external legal opinions, where relevant,  obtained by management; 	   We evaluated management’s assessments by  understanding precedent set in similar cases and  assessed the reliability of the management’s past  estimates /judgements; 	   We evaluated management’s assessment around those  matters that are not disclosed or not considered as  contingent liability, as the probability of material outflow  is considered to be remote by the management; and 	   We assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures. Based on the above work performed, the assessment of  management in respect of litigations and related disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities/other significant litigations  in the Standalone Financial Statements is considered  to be reasonable. Information Other than the Financial Statements  and Auditor’s Report Thereon The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other  information. The other information comprises the information  included in the Management Discussion and Analysis,  Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report,  Business Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance and  Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the Standalone  Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not  cover the other information and we do not express any form of  assurance / conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated. When we read the other information, if we conclude that  there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to  communicate the matter to those charged with governance.  Such other information is pending as on the date of  our audit report. Responsibilities of Management for the  Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the  matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the  preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that  215 Financial Statements 

give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial  performance including other comprehensive income, and cash  flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance  with the accounting principles generally accepted in India,  including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified  under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate  accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the  Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  selection and application of appropriate accounting policies;  making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls, that were operating  effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give  a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial Statements, management is  responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as  a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to  going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or  to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing  the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibility for the audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the financial Statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to  issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also: 	   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error,  design and perform audit procedures responsive to those  risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk  of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud  may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; 	   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal  financial controls system in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. 	   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by management. 	   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of  the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty  exists related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue  as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our  auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial  Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to  modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the  audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may cause  the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 	   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and  whether the financial statements represent the underlying  transactions and events in a manner that achieves  fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone  financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes  it probable that the economic decisions of reasonably  knowledgeable user of the Standalone financial statements  may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and  qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work  and evaluating results of that work; and (ii) to evaluate the  effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone  financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and  where applicable, related safeguards. 216 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law  or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or  when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a  matter should not be communicated in our report because  the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably  be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of  such communication.

“Annexure 2” referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date on the  Standalone Financial Statements of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited for the year ended March 31, 2025 Report on the Internal Financial Controls with  reference to Standalone Financial Statements  under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of  the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls with reference  to Standalone Financial Statements of Indian Railway Catering  and Tourism Corporation Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31,  2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 1.     Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial  Controls   The Company’s management is responsible for  establishing and maintaining internal financial controls  based on the internal controls over financial reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over  financial reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include  the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate  internal financial controls that were operating effectively  for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its  business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the  safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of  frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable  financial information, as required under the Act. 2.   Auditors’ Responsibility   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company's internal financial controls over financial  reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial  Statements based on our audit. We conducted our  audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of  Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the  “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued  by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section  143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of  internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit  of internal financial controls and both issued by ICAI.  Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to  these Standalone Financial Statements were established  and maintained and if such controls operated effectively  in all material respects.   Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  control with reference to these Standalone Financial  Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit  of internal financial control over financial reporting  with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements  included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  control with reference to these Standalone Financial  Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness  exists, and testing and evaluating the design and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the  assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks  of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over  financial reporting with reference to these Standalone  Financial Statements. 3.     Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference  to Standalone Financial Statements   A Company's internal financial controls with reference  to the Standalone Financial Statements is a process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  financial Statements for external purposes in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles. A  Company's internal financial controls with reference  to the Standalone Financial Statements include those  policies and procedures that   (1)   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the  Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of  the Company are being made only in accordance  with authorizations of management and directors  of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the  Company's assets that could have a material effect  on the Standalone Financial Statements. 4.     Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  reference to Standalone Financial Statements   Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting with reference to the  Standalone Financial Statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  225 Financial Statements 

material mis-statements due to error or fraud may occur  and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls with reference to the  Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are  subject to the risk that the internal financial control with  reference to the Standalone Financial Statements may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or  procedures may deteriorate. 5.     According to the information and explanations given  to us and based on our audit, we have following  observations in this regard for the year ended March  31, 2025:   i.   Maker and checker concept, which is an important  internal financial control, is generally missing i.e.  not being implemented resulting in number of  errors and omissions in financial and other data  based on which transactions are recorded in books  of account. Company needs to strengthen more  professional staff.   ii.   We noted that: (a) differences exists between  certain subsidiary and control ledger balances in  books of account maintained in ERP where in such  accounts and differences are being identified and  reconciliation is under progress.   iii.   Guidelines issued by the Company for obtaining  balance confirmation letters from parties have been  followed by offices. No balance confirmation letters  were sent to Railways as the Railways maintain their  books of account on cash basis. Further, response  to balance confirmations sought from private  parties and some of the banks was negligible and  the system and procedures of obtaining balance  confirmations at periodical intervals has not been  reviewed and strengthened to ensure better  response from the parties.   iv.   Manual controls are followed instead of system- based automated controls, checks and balances  as the transactions executed through 3 rd  party  applications / portals are posted manually in ERP  by compiling data through Excel as the existing ERP  application is not integrated with certain functions /  segments of the Company.   v.   Large number of inoperative debit and credit  balances exists as on March 31, 2025 including  large number of legacy entries. Identification,  reconciliation of the inoperative balances has been  done during the year. However, the adjustments/  write-off / write-back has been done in respect of  private parties only as approved by the Board. 6.   Opinion   In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and read with our  observations stated in paragraph 5 above, the company  has, in all the material respects, adequate internal financial  controls with reference to the Standalone Financial  Statements in place and such internal financial controls  with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements were  operating effectively as of March 31, 2025, based on the  internal controls over financial reporting criteria established  by the Company considering the components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial reporting issued by ICAI.

Whether the Company has system in place to process  all the accounting transactions through IT? If yes, the  implications of processing of accounting transactions outside  IT system on the integrity of the accounts along with the  financial implications, if any, may be stated.

Further, online train ticket booking amounts, MCDO data of  tourism, E-Catering, Railneer plants data and transactions are  compiled in Excel and uploaded / posted manually in Financial  Accounting Module of ERP as the master data and transaction  data captured in these third-party applications is not compatible  with ERP application. Based on the audit procedures carried out and as per the  information and explanations given to us, the processing of  accounting transactions outside IT system have no material  issues regarding integrity of the accounts. 2.

Accounting Policies as per Indian Standards (Ind AS) cheque account are credited to Miscellaneous income.  For any claim arising in future, the same are debited to  Miscellaneous Expenses” x)   Financial Instruments: -   Initial recognition and measurement   Financial Instruments recognized at its fair value plus or  minus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value  through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial  instruments. However Financial Assets (trade receivables)  that do not contain a significant financing component are  measured at transaction price.   Financial Asset at Amortized Cost   Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised  cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the  financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding. Financial assets measured  at amortised cost using effective interest rate method less  impairment, if any. The EIR amortisation is included in  finance income in the statement of profit and loss.   Following financial assets are measured at amortised cost: -   (i)   Security deposit   (ii)   Retention money   (iii)   Cash and cash equivalent   (iv)   Advances adjustable with other financial instrument     Financial Assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI)   Financial assets are measured at fair value through  other comprehensive income if these financial assets  are held within a business whose objective is achieved  by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial  asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding.   Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category  are measured initially as well as at each reporting date  at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in  the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the  company recognizes interest income, impairment losses  & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the  P&L. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or  loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from  the equity to P&L. Interest earned is recognised using  the EIR method.   Financial Assets at Fair value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL)   FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets. Any  financial assets, which does not meet the criteria for  categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is  classified as at FVTPL.   In addition, the company may elect to designate financial  asset, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI  criteria, as at FVTPL. If doing so reduces or eliminates a  measurement or recognition inconsistency.   Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are  measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.   Financial liabilities at Amortised Cost   Financial liabilities at amortised cost represented by  trade and other payables, security deposits, advances  refundable and retention money are initially recognized  at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortized cost  using the effective interest rate method.     Financial liabilities at Fair Value through Profit & Loss  (FVTPL)   The company has not designated any financial  liabilities at FVTPL.   De-recognition   Financial Asset   A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a  financial asset or part of a group of similar financial  assets) is derecognized only when the contractual rights  to the cash flows from the asset expires or it transfers the  financial assets and substantially all risks and rewards of  the ownership of the asset.   Financial Liability   A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation  under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.  When an existing financial liability is replaced by another  from the same lender on substantially different terms, or  the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified,  such an exchange or modification is treated as a de- recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a  new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying  amounts is recognised in the statement of Profit & Loss. Financial Statements 245 

Accounting Policies as per Indian Standards (Ind AS)   Impairment of Financial Assets   The Company recognizes loss allowances using the  expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets  which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss  allowance for trade receivables with no significant  financing component is measured at an amount equal  to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are  measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL,  unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk  from initial recognition in which case those are measured  at lifetime ECL. The amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is  required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting  date to the amount that is required to be recognized is  recognized as an impairment gain or loss in the Statement  of Profit & Loss Account. y)   Fair Value Measurement   Company measures financial instruments at fair value at  each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be  received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in  an orderly transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. The fair value measurement is based  on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or  transfer the liability takes place either: 	   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or 	   In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability.   The principal or the most advantageous market must be  accessible to the company. The fair value of an asset or  a liability is measured using the assumptions that market  participants would use when pricing the asset or liability,  assuming that market participants act in their economic  best interest. The company uses valuation techniques  that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which  sufficient data are available to measure fair value,  maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and  minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.   Assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or  disclosed in the financial statements are categorized  within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows,  based on the lowest level input that is significant to the  fair value measurement as a whole:   -   Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities   -   Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is directly or indirectly observable.   -   Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is unobservable.   For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the  financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company  determines whether transfers have occurred between  levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization  (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the  fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each  reporting period.   At the reporting date, the Company analyses the  movements in the values of assets and liabilities which  are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per  the accounting policies. For this analysis, the Company  verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by  agreeing the information in the valuation computation to  contracts and other relevant documents.   The Company also compares the change in the fair value  of each asset and liability with relevant external sources  to determine whether the change is reasonable.   For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company  has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the  basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset  or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as  explained above. 246 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

Note :- 37.2 Contingent Liabilities (As ascertained, quantified and certified by the management) (i)   Claim against the Company not acknowledge as debt*:   *Refer Note Nos. 72 regarding advance ruling application pending. Amounts not ascertained. (ii)   Royale Indian Rail Tours Limited (RIRTL) is a Joint Venture of IRCTC and Cox and King (C&K) on the basis of JV agreement  dated 10.12.2008 for running, operating and managing the luxury tourist train, Maharajas’ Express for a minimum period of  15 years on lease to be taken from IRCTC. It operated the train for one season and thereafter dispute arose between the  management of both the companies.   C&K has initiated the Arbitration Proceedings against IRCTC and RIRTL seeking relief inter alia that (i) the JV Agreement be  specifically performed (ii) the termination of the JV agreement be struck down, (iii) pending the hearing and final disposal of   the claim, it be directed that the Train continues to operate as part of RIRTL (iv) IRCTC be permanently restrained from using  the rake/coaches of the Train for any other purpose other than for exclusive use of the JV Company, (v) to execute a formal  lease agreement for the Train in terms of the JV Agreement (vi) IRCTC be directed to pay  H  2000 lakhs towards shortfall of  268 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements the working capital of the JV Company and (vii) in the alternative and in the unlikely event that specific performance of the JV  Agreement is not granted then claim of damages amounting to  H  35,100 lakhs.   During the proceedings dated 26.07.2021, Counsel for Cox and King made a statement that “The Claimant wishes to restrict  its Claim to  H  2270 Lakhs along with interest being the cost thrown away in this Contract”. The final arguments in the matter  was heard on 28.02.2023 and the Arbitral tribunal has passed an Award dated 31.07.2023 in favour of IRCTC   As per the awards, IRCTC has wholly prevailed in the arbitration and the reliefs claimed by Cox and Kings (C&K) have not  been fully accepted. Hence, there are no financial implication of the said award on the Company. The arbitral award has  attained finality as no appeal has been preferred by the claimant. (iii)   VAT Case filled Before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India   IRCTC has been paying service tax towards on-board catering services in trains in which catering charges are included in  railway fare. The commissioner of VAT vide order dated 23.03.2006 considered on-board catering service in trains as sale of  goods within the meaning of section 2(zc)(vii) of the said Act.   IRCTC filed an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Value Added Tax. The Tribunal, while partly allowing the appeal vide  Order dated 07.09.2006, held that the observations pertaining to Central Act were beyond the Commissioner’s jurisdiction as  they pertained to taxability of the goods on sale or purchase taking place in the course of inter-state sale outside the State.   IRCTC assailed the said order by way of filing writ petitions in the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi at New Delhi praying that the  services rendered by IRCTC are not liable to Value Added Tax under the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 and that on-board  catering services of IRCTC are primarily services in which food and beverages are also provided and are liable to service  tax only. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the decision of commissioner of VAT and dismissed the petition of IRCTC. The  Hon’ble High Court had stated IRCTC is liable to pay VAT. However, it may take refund of service tax already paid.   Aggrieved by the Judgement, IRCTC has moved to Hon’ble Supreme Court, filing Special leave petition against the judgment  dated 19.7.2010 passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi. SLP 25292-25319 of 2010 had been admitted and awaiting its turn.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has granted ad-interim direction in the nature of Status Quo on recovery of the demand raised by  VAT authorities. Hence the matter is sub-judice and IRCTC is not liable to pay VAT at present. However, IRCTC has provided VAT  liability (net of service tax) of  H  8251.01 Lakhs up to FY 2017-18(upto 30 th  June,2017) across India as a matter of prudent accounting  policy and not included in 37.2 (i) above. Corresponding VAT input admissibility is shown as balance with Govt. authorities. (iv)   Certain Licensees who are contractors of IRCTC for providing catering services in trains invoked arbitration clause seeking  compensation on account of difference in rates of regular meal and combo meal as provided in terms of CC 63 of 2013 read  with CC 67 of 2013 circular issued by Indian Railways and further claimed price of welcome drink provided in terms of CC  32 of 2014, for the period from 2014 till date. The arbitrator awarded a sum of  H  7471.65 Lakhs (approx.) in 13 petitions for the  aforesaid services for the period from January 2015 to March 2020.   On the basis of appraisal of the factual position, it is matter of record that the claimant never claimed said amount while  submitting invoices for the aforesaid services rendered to the passengers. These all contracts are SBD contracts and were  assigned to IRCTC post Catering Policy 2017. It is also a matter of record that the services were provided to the passengers  of the Indian Railways and the amount so paid is required to be reimbursed to the IRCTC by the Indian Railways. In these  circumstances, there will not be any liability of the IRCTC as a consequence of the award and there is no need to make  provision pursuant to the above awards. As the Company intends to dispute the awards and also has a right of recovery from  Railways, in case the Company is held liable to pay ultimately. However, the same is included in 37.2 (i) above.   The Company has filed objection against Arbitral award and the Hon’ble High Court, Delhi vide Order dated 09.10.2023  directed the Corporation to deposit the awarded amount so as to stay the execution of the Arbitral Award. In compliance of  the aforesaid order, the Corporation deposited a bank Guarantee to the tune of  H  8471.65 Lakhs so as to stay the execution  of the said award. The Hon’ble High Court of Delhi set aside and quashed the award of  H  4200 Lakhs against IRCTC while  upholding the smaller claim of  H  3200 lakhs and the aforesaid Bank guarantee has been released to IRCTC. Aggrieved by the  said decision, the Corporation and the licensee both have separately filed petitions u/s 37 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act,  1996 for challenging the impugned judgment. The Ld. Divisional Bench by way of judgment dated 10.02.2025 has restored  the Arbitral award qua the Claimant's claim towards second regular meal and welcome drinks. IRCTC has filed SLP against  the judgement dated 10.02.2025 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Financial Statements 269 

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements (v)   Demand notice received from National Anti Profiteering Authority for  J  5041.44 Lakhs:   IRCTC is a manufacturer of Rail Neer Bottled Drinking Water for exclusive sale to onboard passengers and at Railway Stations  through 4 owned plants(previous year 5 plants owned by company. Bilaspur plant converted to PPP Plant in FY 2022-23)  and 12 Plants on PPP model. Post implementation of GST regime w.e.f. 01.07.2017, the tax liability on the product was reduced  from 24 % (excise 12.5% (with abatement of 45%) + VAT 12.5%) to 18% GST. Even though there was no reduction in GST rates  subsequent to GST regime, the Anti profiteering Authority has observed that the benefit of tax has not been passed on to the  consumer and as such issued notice for profiteering amount of  H  5041.44 lakhs under section 171 of the CGST Act, 2017.   Rail Neer admittedly falls under controlled price segment like catering services at stations and on-board. It is also a fact that  on the basis of various yardsticks, the price of the Rail Neer is regulated by Ministry of Railways. The present MRP of  H  15/- was  fixed in the year 2012 through Railway Board Commercial Circular no. 72 of 2012. However the transfer price of Rail Neer is   H  10 for 0-75 kilo meter, above 75 KM  H  10.50 and Ex Rail Neer Plant  H  9.33 fixed by the Company. Despite an increase in cost  of raw material, power and HR cost since the year 2012, Ministry of Railways continued to retain subsidised rate as a part  of mandatory government functions and government objectives in supplying standardise Rail Neer at a lower cost than the  market rate. The authority appears to have misinterpreted section 171 of GST Act and there is every likelihood of dropping the  show cause notice against the Central PSU, which is based on conjectures. The show cause notice has been contested by  the Company and matter was argued in August,2022 but final order from Authority still awaited. No provision has been made  for the said amount and the same is also not included in note 37.2 (i) above.   However, as per the notification No. 23/2022-Central tax issued on 23 rd  November, 2022(effective from 1 st  December, 2022) by  the Government of India, Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been empowered to adjudicate the matter. he proceedings  under the notice issued by NAA therefore stands concluded and now proceedings, if any, will be commenced afresh by the  Competition Commission of India (CCI) and as on date no communication has been received from CCI in this matter. (vi)   Kerala Government has fixed the MRP at  H  13/- per 1 ltr. Bottle of Rail Neer under Essential Commodity Act for selling in Kerala  State and advised the Company to sell Rail Neer bottle at  H  13/- instead of  H  15/-. There is a stay of order against show cause  and seizure vide order dated 27.4.2022 and stay is continuing. No further date has been fixed in this matter as yet. Since, the  financial implication for the same is not ascertainable, the same is not included in note 37.2 (i) above of contingent liabilities. (vii)   The Company has received a show cause cum demand notice dated 18.10.2012 from the Directorate General of Central  Excise Intelligence (DGCEI), Pune, in which the department has raised the demand of  H  7902 lakhs (included in Note No.37 (2) (i) above) on the ground that IRCTC has not paid the service tax on the various services covered under Renting of immovable  property services, Outdoor Catering, business Auxiliary Services, Supply of tangible Goods and Rail Travel Agents.   As per the Department, IRCTC has leased out Food plaza, fast food units and various static units etc. to other catering/vending  contractor for which IRCTC has received license fees. According to DGCEI, service tax is payable on the said license fees  under the service category of "Renting of immovable property".   In the opinion of the IRCTC, such services do not cover under the service category of ""Renting of immovable property""  services as the land is owned by the Indian Railways not by IRCTC and the purpose is to serve the passenger not to earn the  profit. IRCTC filed an appeal before the CESTAT which is under process.   Meanwhile, In the financial year 2019-20. Constitutional validity of the services fall under the "Renting of immovable property"  is challenged through a Special Leave Petition (SLP) by some other aggrieved assesses and the same had been admitted by  the Apex court.   The last hearing on the above mentioned show cause notice was held on 08.05.2019 and the same is adjourned sine die.  Same will be taken up by the CESTAT after the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in the above mentioned SLP. 270 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

The Company has taken  Group Leave Encashment Scheme from LIC for payment towards leave encashment which is not treated as plan assets above. (l)   Sensitivity Analysis   For the year ended March 31 st  2025   The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In  practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity  of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit credit method) has been  applied as when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognized within the statement of financial position.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements The accounting principles used in the preparation of the Standalone financial statements is consistently applied to record revenue  & expenditure in individual segments, as set out in the note of significant accounting policies. Revenue and direct expenses in relation to segment are allocated based on items that are individually identifiable to the respective  segment while the remainder of the costs are allocated to all segments on proportionate basis. The management believes that it  is  not practical to provide segment disclosure to Income Tax expense and accordingly these are separately disclosed as unallocated  and adjusted only against the total income of the Corporation. Assets and Liabilities used in the company’s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments as these are used  interchangeably between segments. The company believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segmental disclosure  relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data could be onerous. 284 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

The inputs to these methods are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this it is not feasible, a degree of  judgement is required in arriving at fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit r isk  and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. b)   Taxes   Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which losses  can be utilized Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax asset that can be  recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profit together with future tax planning strategies. c)   Defined benefit Obligations   Employee benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate,  future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long term nature, a def ined  benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date d)   Useful lives of property, plant and equipment   The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment is as given in the Note 2A(d). Estimated useful lives of property,  plant and equipment are based on number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other  economic factors The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting date. e)   Leases   Company uses its judgement in determining whether or not contract contains a lease, extension option of the lease agreement  and termination option of the lease agreement will be exercised or not. For the land on lease from the railways refer Note No.  2A(d) to estimate the future lease term. Financial Statements 291

However, due to the COVID -19 pandemic, these trains could not run during FY 2020-21. The representations had been made to  Railway Board for waiver of fixed commitments against both Tejas and Kashi Mahakal trains for the non operational period during  the financial year 2020-21. The Railway Board has allowed only partial waive off. IRCTC had again requested Railway Board to  reconsider waiving off the fixed charges (fixed haulage and Custody charges) amounting to  J  2793 Lakhs for non-operational  period of the three trains. However, IRCTC had made full provision for that amount during Financial Year 2020-21. Further, during  the financial year 2022-23, Railway Board had further allowed waiver off amounting  J  174.91 lakhs relating to Tejas trains on  account of Custody and Fixed Haulage charges out of  J  2793 Lakhs. For the balance amount, no communications has been  received from Railway Board till date. Note :- 72 The Company has applied for advance ruling for following issues for which decision of AAR  is still awaited: 1.   Reimbursement of Service Charges: The Government of India through Ministry of Railways, in the public interest had waived  off the service charges from the passengers for booking of online train tickets through IRCTC's website. The Government of  India has reimbursed consolidated amount of  J  8000 Lakhs,  J  8800 Lakhs and  J  3227 Lakhs for the 2017-18 , 2018-19 and  2019-20(up to July-19) respectively. Section 15 (2) of CGST Act 2017, excludes the amount of reimbursement of expenses  received from the Central Government and State Governments from the value of taxable supply, hence the amount received  from the Indian Railways being the Central Government towards the reimbursement of expenses incurred for the providing of  same should not be charged to GST. Therefore no GST was paid by IRCTC for above reimbursement. 2.   Reimbursement of Travel Insurance: The Government of India has decided to provide travel insurance on free of Cost to  the passengers who have booked the train ticket through online to promote digitalization. Accordingly, IRCTC provided the  Insurance free of Cost for which Ministry of Railway had reimbursed the travel insurance of  J  4700 Lakhs on which no GST  was paid by the Company being reimbursement of expenses received from the Central Government. 3.   MDR Received from Acquirer Banks. The IRCTC has received  J  300 Lakhs in FY 2019-20 from Acquirer Banks towards its  share of MDR charges being rate or fee charged on the merchant service providers The Company has treated this payment as  subsidy and no GST was paid on the aforesaid amount, as subsidy received from Central Government and State Governments  shall be excluded from the value of supply and same shall not form part of consideration for the purpose of levying GST.

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements 4.   The IRCTC has received pro-rata Licensee fees from Indian Railways for taken over of catering of SBD trains in the terms of  Catering Policy, 2017 of  J  1385 Lakhs,  J  7058 Lakhs,  J  125 Lakhs for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20 respectively and no  GST was paid on the aforesaid amounts in view of the fact that the GST is not applicable on the aforesaid amount as it was  received from Licensee by the Indian Railways prior to Introduction of GST and service tax was not applicable on the grant of  license for payable to Indian Railways as per Finance Act at the time of its receipt. The proportionate amount paid by Indian  Railways to IRCTC is towards the remaining part of the tender period which was awarded prior to the implementation of GST.  The assigning of license by Indian Railways to its subsidiary i.e. IRCTC does not change the nomenclature of the transaction  as the license has been awarded prior to the implementation of GST. The incidence of tax is the event when the service is  provided/supplied to the service recipient. Thus, the Service being “grant of license” was provided by Indian Railways at the  time when the license was awarded. Note :- 73 Railway Board vide Commercial Circular no. CC60 of 2019 has increased the catering tariff for post and pre-paid trains. However,  the effect of enhancement of License Fee for the periods from 18 th  November,2019 to 22 nd  March, 2020 (for post paid trains) and  27 th  November,2021 to 31 st  December, 2023 (for post and pre-paid trains) on account of increase in catering tariff stated above has  not been ascertained & recognized pending sale assessment in its entirety. After the resumption of regular train services from  27 th   Nov 2021 onwards, the Company has conducted and completed the sales assessment, for all the trains (post-paid trains as well as  prepaid trains). Further, the company has raised certain demand notices for increased License fee, but some of the licensees have  challenged Company’s decision of increased License fees in respective Hon’ble High Courts of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Guwahati.  Further, some of the licensees have requested for arbitration. As the matter is sub-judice and the occurrence is dependent on outcome  of certain event in future, the impact of increase in License fees for pre-paid and post paid trains has not been recognized in  the  Standalone financial statements for the year ended on 31 st  March, 2025 and for previous years up to 31 st  March, 2024. Note :- 74 The menu and tariff of standard meals/items is controlled by Railway Board and these were revised & enhanced vide CC-64  dated 12.12.2019. As per the instructions, these were to be implemented with immediate effect and as an interim measure, sales  assessment in limited units was undertaken to assess the impact of enhancement in License fees. Accordingly, guidelines were  issued on 28.01.2020 for incorporating the impact of enhancement in license fees by adding the weightage assigned to the  License fees of the unit or by undertaking sales assessment within 6 months, whichever is higher. However, unforeseen COVID  pandemic started and lockdown was imposed due to which passenger train operation and stations operations for passengers  were suspended by MoR w.e.f 23.03.2020. The static units at stations were closed and due to lockdown followed by severe restrictions as per Govt. instructions, the sal es  assessment of the units could not be conducted. The temporary passenger train operations started w.e.f. 01.06.2020. Only limited  (PAD & RTE) items were permitted for sale @10% license fee w.e.f. 01.06.2020. However, this was limited to few stations only as  passenger movement at most of the stations was restricted due to local restrictions. On 20.01.2021 guidelines for charging reduced license fees@20% of license fees were issued due to prevailing impact of COVID.  Further, on 04.10.2021 revised guidelines were issued to implement the reduced License fees @ 20% up to 31.10.2021 and new  methodology was implemented for charging of LF w.e.f 01.11.2021 based on footfall. The interim method was followed for ongoing  contracts till 31.05.2022. Instructions were issued for charging 100% license fee w.e.f. 01.06.2022. The sales assessment for all the static units has been completed in the financial year 2022-23. But some of the licensees have  challenged the company decision on enhanced LF in the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala(WP(C) WP 26745/20,WP26795/20,WP267 21/20,WP26703/20. As the matter is sub- judice and there is uncertainty and occurrence is dependent on outcome of certain event in future, hence  the  impact of increase in License fees for Static units has not been recognized in the books of account for the financial years 2022-23,  2023-24 & 2024-25. 296 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements Note :- 78 Legacy Transactions (A)   During the year ended 31 st  March 2025, the Company carried out a one-time reconciliation exercise to identify and resolve  legacy balances that had remained unadjusted over time. These balances had accumulated primarily due to reconciliation  difficulties faced during the earlier transition from the Conventional Accounting System to the New Accounting System.   To ensure accuracy and completeness, each Zonal Office conducted an in-depth review of the third-party balances under its  purview. The exercise aimed to determine whether these balances were still payable or recoverable based on the current  facts and circumstances.   Following this review: 	   Certain liabilities were written back where it was determined that no further payments were due. 	   Certain receivables and advances were written off where recovery was no longer expected. Most of these had already  been provided for in earlier periods under the Expected Credit Loss model in accordance with Ind AS 109, and hence,  these write-offs did not affect the current year’s profit or loss. 	   Some inter-party adjustments (such as between related vendors or internal accounts) were also carried out. These had  no impact on the financial results. 	   A few third-party balances are currently under legal dispute or, in the view of the respective Zones, may still be adjustable  in the future. These have been left unchanged and will be reviewed further when more clarity is available.   The net impact of this reconciliation was a gain, primarily from the write-back of liabilities, and has been shown as an Exceptional  Item in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended 31 st  March 2025. This disclosure is in line with paragraphs 97 and  98 of Ind AS 1, which require separate presentation of items that are significant in nature or size.   Although these balances relate to earlier periods, they do not represent prior period errors. The specific period to which  many of these balances relate could not be determined reliably. For this reason, and in keeping with Ind AS 8, the financial  statements for prior years have not been restated. (B)   The system of classification/identification of liabilities as trade payables including MSME vendors and the aging of payables/ receivables will be revisited and improved in FY 2025-26. Further, identification/Reconciliation/Adjustment of certain  differences between control and subsidiary balances is in progress. Note :- 79 Ex-gratia/Performance related pay to the deputationists The C&AG had commented that the payments of ex-gratia either in lieu of PRP or as pay parity to employees on deputation on  CDA scale was in violation of the DPE and DoPT instructions, and thus inadmissible. Further C&AG have recommended that the  payment of ex-gratia/PRP to the deputationists to be stopped and to ensure recovery of the inadmissible payments of  J  230.13  Lakhs made to deputationists. Accordingly, no such provision has been made w.e.f. financial year 2022-23 and the provisions  outstanding (net of interim payments made) for financial year 2021-22 of  J  30.65 lakhs was written back as on March 31,2023.  However, the Company had represented Railway Board that the performance award paid to the deputationists is not in violation of  the DPE and DoPT instructions. The amount of performance award paid to deputationists is a form of incentive to boost the moral e  of the employees and to retain them with the company. As on date no further communication has been received from Ministry of  Railways by the Company. Appropriate decision will be taken on this matter as and when response is received from Ministry of  Railways which is still awaited. 298 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

Independent Auditors’ Report To the Members of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements  Opinion We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial  Statements of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation  Limited (“hereinafter referred to as Holding Company”) and its  Subsidiary Company (the Holding Company and its Subsidiary  together referred as to “the Group”) comprising the Consolidated  Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive  Income), the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the  Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then  ended and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  including a summary of material accounting policies and  other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the  Consolidated Financial Statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated  Financial Statements give the information required by the  Companies Act, 2013, as amended, (“the Act”) in the manner  so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with  the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) prescribed under  section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standard) Rules, 2015, as amended, and other  accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state  of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025, its profit (financial  performance including other comprehensive income), its  Consolidated cash flows and the Consolidated changes in  equity for the year ended on that date. Basis of Opinion We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs)  specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities  under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements section of our report. We are independent of  the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by  the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with  the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the  financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the  Rules made there under, and we have fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the  Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion on the Consolidated financial statements. Emphasis of Matter We draw attention to: 1.   Note No. 37.2(iv) regarding Arbitration award pronounced  in April 2022 amounting to  H  7,471.65 Lakhs plus simple  interest @ 6% per annum from January 2018 onwards,  given in favour of certain licensees which represents  principal amount towards claims for supply of welcome  drinks not paid to licensees and recovery of differential  costs for the supply of regular meals to the passengers on  the instructions of Railways whereas the price of combo  meal, which is lower than the price of regular meal, was  reimbursed to these licensees. The company has filed  objections against the award and the same was listed  before Honourable High Court of Delhi. The company  contends that the main liability in this matter would be of  Railways and the company has the right to recovery from  Railways in case ultimately it is made liable to pay.   The hearing before Hon’ble high court was done on  19.07.2023 and as per the order dated 09.10.2023, of  Hon’ble high court, the company has been advised to  deposit bank guarantee amount. The company has filed  objections appeal against the award. In compliance of  Hon’ble Delhi High Court order, Bank Guarantee to the  tune of  H  8,471.65 lakhs have been deposited with the court  registry as per the orders of Hon’ble Delhi High Court.   The Hon’ble High Court of Delhi set aside and quashed  the award of  H  4200 Lakhs against group while upholding  the smaller claim of  H  3200 lakhs and the aforesaid  bank guarantee(s) has been released IRCTC. Aggrieved  by the said decision, the Corporation and the licensee  both have separately filed petitions u/s 37 of Arbitration  and Conciliation Act, 1996 for challenging the impugned  judgment. The Ld. Divisional Bench by way of judgment  dated 10.02.2025 has restored the Arbitral award qua  the Claimant's claim towards second regular meal and  welcome drinks. Group has filed SLP against the judgement  dated 10.02.2025 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. 2.   Note No.37.2(v) regarding Notice dated 25.02.2022  issued by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority (GST)  alleging profiteering amounting to  H  5,041.44 Lakhs for the  period July 1, 2017 to May 31, 2020 against the Company  under Section 171 of the CGST Act, 2017 for not passing on  the benefit of reduction in rate of tax to the consumers by  way of commensurate reduction in the MRP of Railneer  brand of drinking water manufactured and sold by the  Company even though there was reduction in the tax  rate on the introduction of GST w.e.f. July 1, 2017. The  Company contends that Railneer drinking water falls  302 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

under controlled price segment as the MRP is fixed by  Ministry of Railways, Government of India and the MRP  fixed in the year 2012 is still continuing despite substantial  increase in prices of raw-materials, power, HR cost, freight  etc. Legal opinion obtained by the Company justifies the  contention of the Company. Competent Commission of  India (“CCI”) is now vested with powers to adjudicate all  such cases in which benefit of tax  reduction not being  passed to consumers by the assesses and the matter is  now pending with CCI. 3.   Note Nos. 49(b) regarding railway share on railneer,  railway board clarified that for Rail Neer plants run  departmentally by the company, the profits between  Railway board and company shall be shared in the ratio  of 15:85 and for plants operated under PPP model/run by  DCO, profits between Railway board and company shall  be shared in the ratio 40:60. Provision for the differential  amount of profit sharing @25% (40%-15%) up to 31 st   March, 2023 amounting  H  1451.24 Lakhs was shown as  an exceptional item for the year ended 31 st  March, 2024,  even though the Company had made representation to  the Railway Board for sharing of profit at uniform ratio  of 15:85 for all Railneer plants till FY 2022-23. However,  Railway Board has advised IRCTC for sharing of profit in  the ratio of 40:60 for PPP plants. 4.   Note No. 39 regarding Balance confirmation letters from  parties & banks: Guidelines issued by the Company  for obtaining balance confirmation letters from parties  & banks have been followed. We are informed that  no balance confirmation letters are sent to Railways/ Government Bodies since their books of account are  maintained on cash basis. The third-party balances are  subject to confirmations and reconciliations from the  various parties. The balance confirmation letters have  been sent to private parties but the response from the  parties is not satisfactory. The system and the procedures  of obtaining balance confirmations at periodic intervals  need to be strengthened to ensure better response  from the parties. 5.   Note No.51(b) regarding non-sharing of input tax credit  data of GST for certain periods by Developer cum  Operators (“DCO”) of four Rail Neer plants resulting in  non-recognition of these claims receivables in the books  of account of the Group.

As the matter is sub-judice and the occurrence  is dependent on outcome of certain event in future, the  impact of increase in License fees for pre-paid and post- paid trains has not been recognized in the financial  statements for the quarter and year ended 31 st  March,  2025 and for previous years up to 31 st  March, 2024. 9.   Note No. 78 regarding: (i) Differences between certain  subsidiary and control ledger balances which are  under process for identification, reconciliation and  adjustments, if any, as on March 31, 2025, (ii) review and  improvement of system of identification and disclosure  of trade payables including MSME suppliers and their  classification into Micro, Small and Medium category to  ensure proper disclosure of their dues in Consolidated  Financial Statements as on March 31, 2025 which needs  improvement by way of confirmations from such parties. 10.

However, the Company has made representation  to the Railway Board All for withdrawal of these  instructions for enhanced charges from retrospective  effect which is pending.   (b)   Exceptional items include  H  220.72 lakhs towards  the reversal of RU, stabling and other charges  waived off on Golden Chariot train by KTDC for the  previous Financial Year 2022-23 and 2023-24 and  of  H  3,988.09 lakhs towards net Impact of one-time  reconciliation of Legacy balances. Our opinion on  the Consolidated Financial Statement is not modified  in respect of above matters. Financial Statements 303 

Key Audit Matter Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit  of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole and  in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a  separate opinion on these matters. We have determined  the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be  communicated in our report. Assessment of litigation and related disclosure  of contingent liabilities Refer to Note No. 2 (c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements  – Use of estimates and judgements-Provisions, Contingent  liabilities and Contingent assets and Note No. 37.2 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements for “Contingent Liabilities”  and other significant litigations stated  therein. As at March 31, 2025, the Group has exposures towards  number of litigations relating to various matters as set out in  the aforesaid Note. Significant management’s judgement is required to assess such  matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material  outflow of economic resources and whether a provision should  be made. The judgement is also supported with legal advice in  certain material cases as considered appropriate. As the ultimate outcome of the litigations are uncertain and the  position taken by the management are based on the application  of their best judgement which may be subject to management  bias, related legal advice including those relating to interpretation  of laws/regulations, we have identified this as a Key Audit Matter. How our audit addressed the k ey audit matter Our audit procedures included the following: 	   We understood, assessed and tested the design and  operating effectiveness of key controls surrounding  assessment of litigations relating to the relevant laws  and regulations; 	   We read and considered latest orders / awards by various  courts / authorities on these matters; 	   We conducted detailed discussions with in-house  legal head, tax consultants and senior management  to understand their assessment on the most likely  outcome of the material litigations and to understand  the basis considered for the provisions made towards  these litigations; 	   We performed our assessment on a test basis on the  underlying calculations supporting the contingent  liabilities/other  significant litigations  disclosed in the  Consolidated Financial Statements; 	   We considered external legal opinions, where relevant,  obtained by management; 	   We evaluated management’s assessments by  understanding precedent set in similar cases and  assessed the reliability of the management’s past  estimates/judgements; 	   We evaluated management’s assessment around those  matters that are not disclosed or not considered as  contingent liability, as the probability of material outflow  is considered to be remote by the management; and 	   We assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures. Based on the above work performed, the assessment of  management in respect of litigations and related disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities/other significant litigations  in the Consolidated Financial Statements is considered  to be reasonable.

changes in equity of the in accordance with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of  the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate  accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing  and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,  relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial Statements,  management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,  matters related to going concern and using the going concern  basis of accounting unless management either intends to  liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic  alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing  the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibility for the audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the financial Statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to  issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also: 	   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial Statements, whether due to fraud  or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The  risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; 	   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Group has adequate internal  financial controls system in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. 	   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by management. 	   Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use  of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material  uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may  cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue  as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our  auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial  Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to  modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the  audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may cause  the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 	   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and  whether the financial statements represent the underlying  transactions and events in a manner that achieves  fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the  Consolidated financial statements that, individually or in  aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of  reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated financial  statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative  materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope  of our audit work and evaluating results of that work; and (ii)  to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the  Consolidated financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and  where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of  most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial  Financial Statements 305 

Statements of the current period and are therefore the key  audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s  report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure  about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,  we determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our report because the adverse consequences of doing so  would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication. Other matters We did not audit the financial statements of subsidiary company,  whose financial statements reflect total assets of  H  2562.93 lakhs  as of March 31, 2025, total income of  H  85.59 lakhs and Net Profit/ (loss) of  H  24.62 lakhs and net cash inflow of  H  171.79 lakhs for  the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated  financial statements. The financial statements of subsidiary  company have not been audited till the date of our report by  their statutory auditor, who has been appointed by the CAG.

“Annexure 1”   referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date  on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited for the year ended  March 31, 2025 Report on the Internal Financial Controls with  reference to Consolidated Financial Statements  under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143  of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to  Consolidated Financial Statements of Indian Railway Catering  and Tourism Corporation Limited (“the Group”) as of March 31,  2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements of the Group for the year ended on that date. 1.   Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial  Controls   The Group’s management is responsible for establishing and  maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal  controls over financial reporting criteria established by the  Group considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls over financial reporting issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating  effective for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of  its business, including adherence to Group’s policies, the  safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of  frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable  financial information, as required under the Act. 2.   Auditors’ Responsibility   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's  internal financial controls over financial reporting with  reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements  based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance  with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”)    and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed  to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the  extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls,  both applicable  to an audit of internal financial controls and  both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance  Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and  plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether adequate internal financial  controls  with    reference  to these Consolidated Financial Statements  were established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects.   Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  control with reference to these Consolidated Financial  Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit  of internal financial control over financial reporting with  reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements  included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  control with reference to these Consolidated Financial  Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness  exists, and testing and evaluating the design and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the  assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks  of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls over  financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated  Financial Statements. 3.   Meaning  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  with  reference   to  Consolidated  Financial Statements   A Group's internal financial controls with reference to  the Consolidated Financial Statements is a process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  financial Statements for external purposes in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles. A  Group's internal financial controls with reference to the  Consolidated Financial Statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the  Group; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of  Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that  receipts and expenditures of the Group are being made  only in accordance with authorizations of management  and directors of the Group; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the  Group's assets that could have a material effect on the  Consolidated Financial Statements. 308 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

4.   Inherent  Limitations  of  Internal  Financial  Controls    with  reference  to  Consolidated Financial Statements   Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting with reference to  the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the  possibility of collusion or improper management override  of controls, material mis-statements due to error or fraud  may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any  evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference  to the Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods  are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with  reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or  procedures may deteriorate. 5.   According to the information and explanations given to us  and based on our audit, we have following observations  in this regard for the year ended March 31, 2025:   i.   Maker and checker concept, which is an important  internal financial control, is generally missing i.e.  not being implemented resulting in number of  errors and omissions in financial and other data  based on which transactions are recorded in books  of account. Company needs to strengthen more  professional staff.   ii.   We noted that: (a) differences exists between  certain subsidiary and control ledger balances in  books of account maintained in ERP where in such  accounts and differences are being identified and  reconciliation is under progress.   iii.   Guidelines issued by the Group for obtaining  balance confirmation letters from parties have been  followed by offices. No balance confirmation letters  were sent to Railways as the Railways maintain their  books of account on cash basis. Further, response  to balance confirmations sought from private  parties and some of the banks was negligible and  the system and procedures of obtaining balance  confirmations at periodical intervals has not been  reviewed and strengthened to ensure better  response from the parties.   iv.   Manual controls are followed instead of system- based automated controls, checks and balances  as the transactions executed through 3 rd   party  applications / portals are posted manually in ERP  by compiling data through Excel as the existing ERP  application is not integrated with certain functions /  segments of the Group.   v.   Large number of inoperative debit and credit  balances exists as on March 31, 2025 including  large number of legacy entries. Identification,  reconciliation of the inoperative balances has been  done during the year. However, the adjustments/  write-off / write-back has been done in respect of  private parties only as approved by the Board. 6.   Opinion   In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and read with our  observations stated in paragraph 5 above, the Group has, in  all the material respects, adequate internal financial controls  with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements  in place and such internal financial controls with reference  to the Consolidated Financial Statements were operating  effectively as of March 31, 2025, based on the internal  controls over financial reporting criteria established by the  Group considering the components of internal control stated  in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  Over Financial reporting issued by ICAI.

However Financial Assets (trade receivables)  that do not contain a significant financing component are  measured at transaction price.   Financial Asset at Amortized Cost   Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised  cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the  financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding. Financial assets measured  at amortised cost using effective interest rate method less  impairment, if any. The EIR amortisation is included in  finance income in the statement of profit and loss.   Following financial assets are measured at amortised cost: -   (i)   Security deposit   (ii)   Retention money   (iii)   Cash and cash equivalent   (iv)   Advances adjustable with other financial instrument   Financial Assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI)   Financial assets are measured at fair value through  other comprehensive income if these financial assets  are held within a business whose objective is achieved  by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial  asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding.   Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category  are measured initially as well as at each reporting date  at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in  the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the  company recognizes interest income, impairment losses  & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the  Financial Statements 327 

Accounting Policies as per Indian Standards (Ind AS) P&L. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or  loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from  the equity to P&L. Interest earned is recognised using  the EIR method.   Financial Assets at Fair value through Profit & Loss  (FVTPL)   FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets. Any  financial assets, which does not meet the criteria for  categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is  classified as at FVTPL.   In addition, the company may elect to designate financial  asset, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI  criteria, as at FVTPL. If doing so reduces or eliminates a  measurement or recognition inconsistency.   Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are  measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.   Financial liabilities at Amortised Cost   Financial liabilities at amortised cost represented by  trade and other payables, security deposits, advances  refundable and retention money are initially recognized  at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortized cost  using the effective interest rate method.   Financial liabilities at Fair Value through Profit & Loss  (FVTPL)   The company has not designated any financial  liabilities at FVTPL.   De-recognition   Financial Asset   A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a  financial asset or part of a group of similar financial  assets) is derecognized only when the contractual rights  to the cash flows from the asset expires or it transfers the  financial assets and substantially all risks and rewards of  the ownership of the asset.   Financial Liability   A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation  under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.  When an existing financial liability is replaced by another  from the same lender on substantially different terms, or  the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified,  such an exchange or modification is treated as a de- recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a  new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying  amounts is recognised in the statement of Profit & Loss.   Impairment of Financial Assets   The Company recognizes loss allowances using the  expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets  which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss  allowance for trade receivables with no significant  financing component is measured at an amount equal  to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are  measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL,  unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk  from initial recognition in which case those are measured  at lifetime ECL. The amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is  required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting  date to the amount that is required to be recognized is  recognized as an impairment gain or loss in the Statement  of Profit & Loss Account. y)   Fair Value Measurement   Company measures financial instruments at fair value at  each reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be  received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in  an orderly transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. The fair value measurement is based  on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or  transfer the liability takes place either: 	   In the principal market for the asset or liability, or 	   In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability.   The principal or the most advantageous market must be  accessible to the company. The fair value of an asset or  a liability is measured using the assumptions that market  participants would use when pricing the asset or liability,  assuming that market participants act in their economic  best interest. The company uses valuation techniques  that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which  sufficient data are available to measure fair value,  maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and  minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.   Assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or  disclosed in the financial statements are categorized  within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows,  based on the lowest level input that is significant to the  fair value measurement as a whole: 328 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

Accounting Policies as per Indian Standards (Ind AS)   -   Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities   -   Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is directly or indirectly observable.   -   Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is unobservable.   For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial  statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines  whether transfers have occurred between levels in the  hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on  the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.   At the reporting date, the Company analyses the  movements in the values of assets and liabilities which  are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per  the accounting policies. For this analysis, the Company  verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by  agreeing the information in the valuation computation to  contracts and other relevant documents.   The Company also compares the change in the fair value  of each asset and liability with relevant external sources  to determine whether the change is reasonable.   For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company  has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the  basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset  or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as  explained above.

(ii)   Royale Indian Rail Tours Limited (RIRTL) is a Joint Venture of IRCTC and Cox and King (C&K) on the basis of JV agreement  dated 10.12.2008 for running, operating and managing the luxury tourist train, Maharajas’ Express  for a minimum period of  15 years on lease to be taken from IRCTC. It operated the train for one season and thereafter dispute arose between the  management of both the companies.   C&K has initiated the Arbitration Proceedings against IRCTC  and RIRTL seeking relief inter alia that (i) the JV Agreement be  specifically performed (ii) the termination of the JV agreement be struck down, (iii) pending the hearing and final disposal of   the claim, it be directed that the Train continues to operate as part of RIRTL (iv) IRCTC be permanently restrained from using  the rake/coaches of the Train for any other purpose other than for exclusive use of the JV Company, (v) to execute a formal  lease agreement for the Train in terms of the JV Agreement (vi) IRCTC  be directed to pay  H 2000 lakhs towards shortfall of  the working capital of the JV Company and (vii) in the alternative and in the unlikely event that specific performance of the JV  Agreement is not granted then claim of damages amounting to  H 35,100 lakhs.   During the proceedings dated 26.07.2021, Counsel for Cox and King made a statement that “The Claimant wishes to restrict  its Claim to  H  2270 Lakhs along with interest being the cost thrown away in this Contract”. The final arguments in the matter  was heard on 28.02.2023 and the Arbitral tribunal has passed an Award dated 31.07.2023 in favour of IRCTC   As per the awards, IRCTC has wholly prevailed in the arbitration and the reliefs claimed by Cox and Kings (C&K) have not  been fully accepted.  Hence, there are no financial implication of the said award on the Group. The arbitral award has  attained finality as no appeal has been preferred by the claimant. (iii)   VAT Case filled Before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India   IRCTC has been paying service tax towards on-board catering services in trains in which catering charges are included in  railway fare. The commissioner of VAT vide order dated 23.03.2006 considered on-board catering service in trains as sale of  goods within the meaning of section 2(zc)(vii) of the said Act. Financial Statements 351 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   IRCTC filed an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Value Added Tax. The Tribunal, while partly allowing the appeal vide  Order dated 07.09.2006, held that the observations pertaining to Central Act were beyond the Commissioner’s jurisdiction as  they pertained to taxability of the goods on sale or purchase taking place in the course of inter-state sale outside the State.   IRCTC assailed the said order by way of filing writ petitions in the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi at New Delhi praying that the  services rendered by IRCTC are not liable to Value Added Tax under the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 and that on-board  catering services of IRCTC are primarily services in which food and beverages are also provided and are liable to service  tax only. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the decision of commissioner of VAT and dismissed the petition of IRCTC. The  Hon’ble High Court had stated IRCTC is liable to pay VAT. However, it may take refund of service tax already paid.   Aggrieved by the Judgement, IRCTC has moved to Hon’ble Supreme Court, filing Special leave petition against the judgment  dated 19.7.2010 passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi.  SLP 25292-25319 of 2010 had been admitted and awaiting its  turn. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has granted ad-interim direction in the nature of Status Quo on recovery of the demand  raised by VAT authorities. Hence the matter is sub-judice and IRCTC is not liable to pay VAT at present. However, IRCTC has  provided VAT liability (net of service tax) of  H  8251.01 Lakhs up to FY 2017-18(upto 30 th  June,2017) across India as a matter of  prudent accounting policy and not included in 37.2 (i) above. Corresponding VAT input admissibility is shown as balance with  Govt. authorities. (iv)   Certain Licensees who are contractors of IRCTC for providing catering services in trains invoked arbitration clause seeking  compensation on account of difference in rates of regular meal and combo meal as provided in terms of CC 63 of 2013 read  with CC 67 of 2013 circular issued by Indian Railways and further claimed price of welcome drink provided in terms of CC  32 of 2014, for the period from 2014 till date. The arbitrator awarded a sum of  H  7471.65 Lakhs (approx.) in 13 petitions for the  aforesaid services for the period from January 2015 to March 2020.   On the basis of appraisal of the factual position, it is matter of record that the claimant never claimed said amount while  submitting invoices for the aforesaid services rendered to the passengers. These all contracts are SBD contracts and were  assigned to IRCTC post Catering Policy 2017. It is also a matter of record that the services were provided to the passengers  of the Indian Railways and the amount so paid is required to be reimbursed to the IRCTC by the Indian Railways.  In these  circumstances, there will not be any liability of the IRCTC as a consequence of the award and there is no need to make  provision pursuant to the above awards. As the Group intends to dispute the awards and also has a right of recovery from  Railways, in case the Group is held liable to pay ultimately. However, the same is included in 37.2 (i) above.   The Group has filed objection against Arbitral award and the Hon’ble High Court, Delhi vide Order dated 09.10.2023 directed  the Corporation to deposit the awarded amount so as to stay the execution of the Arbitral Award. In compliance of the  aforesaid order, the Corporation deposited a bank guarantee to the tune of  H  8471.65 Lakhs so as to stay the execution of the  said award.  The Hon’ble High Court of Delhi set aside and quashed the award of  H  4200 Lakhs against IRCTC while upholding  the smaller claim of  H  3200 lakhs and the aforesaid Bank guarantee(s) has been released to IRCTC. Aggrieved by the said  decision,  the Corporation and the licensee both have separately filed petitions u/s 37  of Arbitration and Conciliation Act,  1996 for challenging the impugned judgment. The Ld. Divisional Bench by way of judgment dated 10.02.2025 has restored  the Arbitral award qua the Claimant's claim towards second regular meal and welcome drinks. IRCTC has filed SLP against  the judgement dated 10.02.2025 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. (v)   Demand notice received from National Anti Profiteering Authority for  H  5041.44 Lakhs:   IRCTC is a manufacturer of Rail Neer Bottled Drinking Water for exclusive sale to onboard passengers and at Railway Stations  through 4owned plants(previous year 5 plants owned by Group. Bilaspur plant  converted to PPP Plant in FY 2022-23) and  12 Plants on PPP model. Post implementation of GST regime w.e.f. 01.07.2017, the tax liability on the product was reduced  from 24 % (excise 12.5% (with abatement of 45%) + VAT 12.5%) to 18% GST. Even though there was no reduction in GST rates  subsequent to GST regime, the Anti profiteering Authority has observed that the benefit of tax has not been passed on to the  consumer and as such issued notice for profiteering amount of  H  5041.44 lakhs under section 171 of the CGST Act, 2017.   Rail Neer admittedly falls under controlled price segment like catering services at stations and on-board. It is also a fact  that on the basis of various yardsticks, the price of the Rail Neer is regulated by Ministry of Railways. The present MRP of  H   15/- was fixed in the year 2012 through Railway Board Commercial Circular no. 72 of 2012. However the transfer price of Rail  Neer is  H  10 for 0-75 kilo meter, above 75 KM  H  10.50 and Ex Rail Neer Plant  H  9.33 fixed by the Group. Despite an increase  in cost of raw material, power and HR cost since the year 2012, Ministry of Railways continued to retain subsidised rate as a  352 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements part of mandatory government functions and government objectives in supplying standardise Rail Neer at a lower cost than  the market rate. The authority appears to have misinterpreted section 171 of GST Act and there is every likelihood of dropping  the show cause notice against the Central PSU, which is based on conjectures. The show cause notice has been contested  by the Group and matter was  argued in August,2022 but final order from Authority still awaited. No provision has been made  for the said amount and the same is also not included in note 37.2 (i) above.   However, as per the notification No. 23/2022-Central tax issued on 23 rd  November, 2022(effective from 1 st  December, 2022)  by the Government of India, Competition Commission of India (CCI)  has been empowered to adjudicate the matter. The  proceedings under the notice issued by NAA therefore stands concluded and now proceedings, if any, will be commenced  afresh by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and as on date no communication has been received from CCI  in this matter. (vi)   Kerala Government has fixed the MRP at  H  13/- per 1 ltr. Bottle of Rail Neer under Essential Commodity Act for selling in Kerala  State and advised the Group to sell Rail Neer bottle at  H  13/- instead of  H  15/-. There is a stay of order against show cause  and seizure vide order dated 27.4.2022 and stay is continuing. No further date has been fixed in this matter as yet.  Since, the  financial implication for the same is not ascertainable, the same is not included in note 37.2 (i) above of contingent liabilities. (vii)   The Group has received a show cause cum demand notice dated 18.10.2012 from the Directorate General of Central Excise  Intelligence (DGCEI), Pune, in which the department has raised the demand of  H   7902 lakhs (included in Note No.37 (2)(i)  above) on the ground that IRCTC has not paid the service tax on the various services covered under Renting of immovable  property services, Outdoor Catering, business Auxiliary Services, Supply of tangible Goods and Rail Travel Agents.   As per the Department, IRCTC has leased out Food plaza, fast food units and various static units etc. to other catering/vending  contractor for which IRCTC has received license fees. According to DGCEI, service tax is payable on the said license fees  under the service category of "Renting of immovable property".   In the opinion of the IRCTC, such services do not cover under the service category of ""Renting of immovable property""  services as the land is owned by the Indian Railways not by IRCTC and the purpose is to serve the passenger not to earn the  profit. IRCTC filed an appeal before the CESTAT which is under process.   Meanwhile, In the financial year 2019-20. Constitutional validity of the services fall under the "Renting of immovable property"  is challenged through a Special Leave Petition (SLP) by some other aggrieved assesses and the same had been admitted by  the Apex court.   The last hearing on the above mentioned show cause notice was held on 08.05.2019 and the same is adjourned sine die.  Same will be taken up by the CESTAT after the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in the above mentioned SLP. Note :- 37.3 Contingent Assets Amount ( H  in Lakhs) S.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note :- 53 Segment Reporting The CODM & Manager for corporate planning examines the business performance on the basis of the nature of the services  rendered by the Group, organization structure & internal reporting system and has identified five reportable segments of its  business as follows:- 	   Catering 	   Railneer 	   Tourism & Train Operation 	   Internet Ticketing." The Group caters mainly to the needs of the domestic market.  As such there are no reportable geographical segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the Consolidated financial statements is consistently applied to record  revenue & expenditure in individual segments, as set out in the note of significant accounting policies. Revenue and direct expenses in relation to segment are allocated based on items that are individually identifiable to the respective  segment while the remainder of the costs are allocated to all segments on proportionate basis. The management believes that it  is  not practical to provide segment disclosure to Income Tax expense and accordingly these are separately disclosed as unallocated  and adjusted only against the total income of the Corporation. Assets and Liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments as these are used  interchangeably between segments. The Group believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segmental disclosure  relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data could be onerous.

The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's financial risk activities are governed by appropriate  policies and procedures and that financial risk are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the companies policies  and  risk objectives. The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risk, which are summarized belo w:-" a)   Market Risk   Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes  in  market prices. Market risk comprises Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk  includes security deposits, Bank deposits and other non derivative financial instruments.   i)   Interest Rate Risk     Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of  change in market interest rate.  The Group manages its interest risk in accordance with the companies policies and risk  objective. Financial instruments affected by interest rate risk includes deposits with banks. Interest rate risk on these  financial instruments are very low as interest rate is for the period of financial instruments.   ii)   Foreign Currency Risk     The Group operates internationally. In view of low volume of foreign currency transactions, no material exposure exists  from foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency transactions. Group does not hedge any foreign currency risk. b)   Credit risk   Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet  its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. The Group is exposed to  credit risk from its financial activities including trade receivable, deposits with banks, financial institutions and other fin ancial  instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. The objective of  managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Group assesses the credit quality of the  counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. c)   Financial Instruments and cash deposits   Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Group's policy. Investment  of surplus are made only with approved counterparty on the basis of the financial quotes received from the counterparty. d)   Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Group  manages its liquidity risk by ensuring , as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when  due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Group's reputation.   The Group's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations.  The Group  has no bank borrowings. The Group believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current operational  requirements. Any short term- surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management  and other operational requirements, are retained as cash and investment in short term deposits with banks. The said  investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity. 370 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

The inputs to these methods are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this it is not feasible, a degree of  judgement is required in arriving at fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit r isk  and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. b)   Taxes   Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which losses  can be utilized Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax asset that can be  recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profit together with future tax planning strategies. c)   Defined benefit Obligations   Employee benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate,  future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long term nature, a def ined  benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date d)   Useful lives of property, plant and equipment   The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment is as given in the Note 2A(d). Estimated useful lives of property,  plant and equipment are based on number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other  economic factors The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting date. e)   Leases   Group uses its judgement in determining whether or not contract contains a lease, extension option of the lease agreement  and termination option of the lease agreement will be exercised or not.  For the land on lease from the railways refer Note  No. 2 (A)(d) to estimate the future lease term. 372 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited

Note :- 72 The Group has applied for advance ruling for following issues for which decision of AAR is  still awaited: 1.   Reimbursement of Service Charges:  The Government of India through Ministry of Railways, in the public interest had waived  off the service charges from the passengers for booking of online train tickets through IRCTC's website. The Government of  India has reimbursed consolidated amount of  H  8000 Lakhs,  H  8800 Lakhs and  H  3227 Lakhs for the 2017-18 , 2018-19 and  2019-20(up to July-19) respectively. Section 15 (2) of CGST Act 2017, excludes the amount of reimbursement of expenses  received from the Central Government and State Governments from the value of taxable supply, hence the amount received  from the Indian Railways being the Central Government towards the reimbursement of expenses incurred for the providing of  same should not be charged to GST. Therefore no GST was paid by IRCTC for above reimbursement. 2.   Reimbursement of Travel Insurance: The Government of India has decided to provide travel insurance on free of Cost to  the passengers who have booked the train ticket through online to promote digitalization. Accordingly, IRCTC provided the  Insurance free of Cost for which Ministry of  Railway had reimbursed the travel insurance of  H  4700 Lakhs on which no GST  was paid by the Company being reimbursement of expenses received from the Central Government. 3.   MDR Received from Acquirer Banks. The IRCTC has received  H  300 Lakhs in FY 2019-20 from Acquirer Banks towards its  share of MDR charges being rate or fee charged on the merchant service providers The Company has treated this payment as  subsidy and no GST was paid on the aforesaid amount, as subsidy received from Central Government and State Governments  shall be excluded from the value of supply and same shall not form part of consideration for the purpose of levying GST. 376 Annual Report 2024-25 Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 4.   The IRCTC has received pro-rata Licensee fees from Indian Railways for taken over of catering of SBD trains in the terms of  Catering Policy, 2017 of  H  1385 Lakhs,  H  7058 Lakhs,  H  125 Lakhs for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20 respectively and no  GST was paid on the aforesaid amounts in  view of the fact that the GST is not applicable on the aforesaid amount as it was  received from Licensee by the Indian Railways prior to Introduction of GST and  service tax was not applicable on the grant of  license for payable to Indian Railways as per Finance Act at the time of its receipt. The proportionate amount paid by Indian  Railways to IRCTC is towards the remaining part of the tender period which was awarded prior to the implementation of GST.  The assigning of license by Indian Railways to its subsidiary i.e. IRCTC  does not change the nomenclature of the transaction  as the license has been awarded prior to the implementation of GST. The incidence of tax is the event when the service is  provided/supplied to the service recipient. Thus, the Service being “grant of license” was provided by Indian Railways at the  time when the license was awarded. Note :- 73 Railway Board vide Commercial Circular no. CC60 of 2019 has increased the catering tariff for post and pre-paid trains. However,  the effect of enhancement of License Fee for the periods from 18 th  November,2019 to 22 nd  March, 2020 (for post paid trains) and  27 th  November,2021 to 31 st  December, 2023 (for post and pre-paid trains) on account of increase in catering tariff stated above has  not been ascertained & recognized pending sale assessment in its entirety .After the resumption of regular train services from  27 th   Nov 2021 onwards, the Company has conducted and completed the sales assessment, for all the trains (post-paid trains as well  as prepaid trains). Further, the company has raised certain demand notices for increased License fee, but some of the licensees  have challenged Company’s decision of increased License fees in respective Hon’ble High Courts of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata  and Guwahati. Further, some of the licensees have requested for arbitration. As the matter is sub-judice and the occurrence is  dependent on outcome of certain event in future, the impact of increase in License fees for pre-paid and post paid trains has n ot  been recognized in the Consolidated  financial statements for the year ended on 31 st  March, 2025 and for previous years up to  31 st  March, 2024. Note :- 74 The menu and tariff of standard meals/items is controlled by Railway Board and these were revised & enhanced vide CC-64  dated 12.12.2019. As per the instructions, these were to be implemented with immediate effect and as an interim measure, sales  assessment in limited units was undertaken to assess the impact of enhancement in License fees. Accordingly, guidelines were  issued on 28.01.2020 for incorporating the impact of enhancement in license fees by adding the weightage assigned to the  License fees of the unit or by undertaking sales assessment within 6 months, whichever is higher. However, unforeseen COVID  pandemic started and lockdown was imposed due to which passenger train operation and stations operations for passengers  were suspended by MoR w.e.f 23.03.2020. The static units at stations were closed and due to lockdown followed by severe restrictions as per Govt. instructions, the sal es  assessment of the units could not be conducted. The temporary passenger train operations started w.e.f. 01.06.2020. Only limited  (PAD & RTE) items were permitted for sale @10% license fee w.e.f. 01.06.2020. However, this was limited to few stations only as  passenger movement at most of the stations was restricted due to local restrictions. On 20.01.2021 guidelines for charging reduced license fees@20% of license fees were issued due to prevailing impact of COVID.  Further, on 04.10.2021 revised guidelines were issued to implement the reduced License fees @ 20% up to 31.10.2021 and new  methodology was implemented for charging of LF w.e.f 01.11.2021 based on footfall. The interim method was followed for ongoing  contracts till 31.05.2022. Instructions were issued for charging 100% license fee w.e.f. 01.06.2022. The sales assessment for all the static units has been completed in the financial year 2022-23. But some of the licensees have  challenged the company decision on enhanced LF in the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala(WP(C) WP 26745/20,WP26795/20,WP267 21/20,WP26703/20. As the matter is sub- judice and there is uncertainty and occurrence is dependent on outcome of certain event in future, hence  the  impact of increase in License fees for Static units has not been recognized in the books of account for the financial years 2022-23,  2023-24 & 2024-25.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note :- 78 Legacy Transactions (A)   During the year ended 31 st  March 2025, the Company carried out a one-time reconciliation exercise to identify and resolve  legacy balances that had remained unadjusted over time. These balances had accumulated primarily due to reconciliation  difficulties faced during the earlier transition from the Conventional Accounting System to the New Accounting System.   To ensure accuracy and completeness, each Zonal Office conducted an in-depth review of the third-party balances under its  purview. The exercise aimed to determine whether these balances were still payable or recoverable based on the current  facts and circumstances.   Following this review: 	   Certain liabilities were written back where it was determined that no further payments were due. 	   Certain receivables and advances were written off where recovery was no longer expected. Most of these had already  been provided for in earlier periods under the Expected Credit Loss model in accordance with Ind AS 109, and hence,  these write-offs did not affect the current year’s profit or loss. 	   Some inter-party adjustments (such as between related vendors or internal accounts) were also carried out. These had  no impact on the financial results. 	   A few third-party balances are currently under legal dispute or, in the view of the respective Zones, may still be adjustable  in the future. These have been left unchanged and will be reviewed further when more clarity is available.   The net impact of this reconciliation was a gain, primarily from the write-back of liabilities, and has been shown as an Exceptional  Item in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended 31 st  March 2025. This disclosure is in line with paragraphs 97 and  98 of Ind AS 1, which require separate presentation of items that are significant in nature or size.   Although these balances relate to earlier periods, they do not represent prior period errors. The specific period to which  many of these balances relate could not be determined reliably. For this reason, and in keeping with Ind AS 8, the financial  statements for prior years have not been restated. (B)   The system of classification/identification of liabilities as trade payables including MSME vendors and the aging of payables/ receivables will be revisited and improved in FY 2025-26. Further, identification/Reconciliation/Adjustment of certain  differences between control and subsidiary balances is in progress. Note :- 79 Ex-gratia/Performance related pay to the deputationists The C&AG had commented that the payments of ex-gratia either in lieu of PRP or as pay parity to employees on deputation on  CDA scale was in violation of the DPE and DoPT instructions, and thus inadmissible. Further C&AG have recommended that the  payment of ex-gratia/PRP to the deputationists to be stopped and to ensure recovery of the inadmissible payments of  H  230.13  Lakhs made to deputationists. Accordingly, no such provision has been made w.e.f. financial year 2022-23 and the provisions  outstanding (net of interim payments made) for financial year 2021-22 of  H   30.65 lakhs was written back as on March 31,2023.  However, the Company had represented Railway Board that the performance award paid to the deputationists is not in violation of  the DPE and DoPT instructions. The amount of performance award paid to deputationists is a form of incentive to boost the moral e  of the employees and to retain them with the company. As on date no further communication has been received from Ministry of  Railways by the Company. Appropriate decision will be taken on this matter as and when response is received from Ministry of  Railways  which is still awaited. Note :- 80 Disclosures required under Ind-AS and Schedule III of Companies Act,2013 (as amended) The Group has made the disclosures at appropriate place regarding the relevant items or transactions of balance sheet and  statement of profit and loss.
