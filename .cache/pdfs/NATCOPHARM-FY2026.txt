This is complemented  by on-site solar and off-site wind  energy installations, as well as  renewable power procurement  through third-party PPAs, which  together reduce dependence on  fossil fuel-based energy. In parallel,  we are increasingly adopting green  and clean fuels to meet our thermal  energy needs. Our efficiency drive  is further supported by advanced  systems such as LED lighting, IE3  motors, VFDs (Variable Frequency  Drives), and Building Management  Systems (BMS) that regulate energy  use in controlled environments like  HVAC and R&D labs. 	 » Integrated solar PV systems  across multiple units 	 » Shifted to  energy-efficient  HVAC systems  and  motorised equipment 	 » Replaced conventional lighting  with LEDs across plants 	 » Commissioned energy audits at  API and formulation units Key Initiatives 20,060 MWh  Renewable Energy  Generated 14,582 Mt CO 2 e avoided through clean  energy use 1,054 MWh Energy saved through  energy conservation  measures implemented Emissions and Air Quality  Management We maintain strict control over  both point and fugitive emissions  through multi-stage air pollution  control equipment, including  scrubbers, bag filters and activated  carbon beds. Continuous Emission  Monitoring Systems (CEMS) are  installed at major stacks to ensure  real-time compliance. We have  adopted process improvements  and material substitutions that  reduce emissions at source, in  addition to tracking Scope 1  and Scope 2 emissions as part  of our ESG roadmap. Waste Minimisation and Green Chemistry We have adopted a cradle-to-cradle philosophy, where waste is not a burden  but a resource to be repurposed. Our hazardous waste is stored, handled  and disposed of in strict accordance with regulatory norms, including  pre-processing in co-processing units to ensure zero landfill. We have also  invested in solvent recovery systems and green chemistry protocols to  reduce the environmental load of manufacturing processes. 	 » CEMS for real-time  monitoring of emissions 	 » Advanced scrubbers and  scrub towers installed at  high-emission units 	 » Transition to low-sulphur  fuels and improved  combustion efficiency 	 » Ongoing replacement of  high-GWP refrigerants  in cooling systems 	 » Installed solvent  recovery systems with  >90% recovery rates 	 » Replaced hazardous  reagents with safer  alternatives in API synthesis 	 » Pre-processed hazardous waste  through authorised cement kilns Key Initiatives Key Initiatives 4,694 Tonnes 2,765 KL 4 About 3% About 98.50% 95%+ 100% Waste is safely recycled or  co-processed Solvents recovered and reused/ recycled through authorized  solvent recovery agencies Manufacturing facilities  achieved Zero waste to  landfills status Waste sent to    secured landfills Waste is diverted from    landfills in three    manufacturing facilities Emission capture efficiency  across key stacks Compliance with ambient  air quality standards at all  locations Hazardous Waste  -  Managed  through pre-processing and  co-processing in authorised  cement kilns, treatment at TSDFs,  and structured recycling of  used oil, e-waste and batteries  through licensed recyclers  and buy-back systems.

Implementation Approach Community and Learning Outcomes The program follows the Telangana pre-school framework  – Priyadarshini, guided by ECE experts from RIVER in  classroom engagement and content delivery. While  Anganwadi Teachers oversee overall child welfare,  the assistant educators focuses on the education and  development of the children. Classrooms are redesigned  with age-appropriate teaching-learning materials  and daily schedules are structured to support holistic  child development. The initiative has improved children’s learning  outcomes, hygiene habits and confidence. With full- day engagement, active parent involvement and  regular assessments, the programme builds strong  early educational foundation while enhancing trust  and fostering collaboration between parents, teachers  and the community. A Parent’s Perspective – Kothur Empowering  Education Delivery  My daughter has shown remarkable improvement  since she began attending the Anganwadi  centre with the support of an assistant educator.  Every evening, she excitedly recounts the day’s  activities, elaborating upon her lessons, stories  and rhymes she enjoyed as well as the games she  played. She now confidently recognises Telugu  and English alphabets, counts numbers and sings  rhymes fluently. Additionally, she is more aware  of her personal space and politely communicates  with others. The assistant educator has played  a key role in nurturing her growth academically,  emotionally and socially. I started as an Assistant  Educator at NATCO Trust in  2018. After receiving training in  the RIVER MGML methodology  in 2024, I have been able to  handle multi-grade classrooms  more efficiently. Further, regular  refresher sessions and feedback  from mentors have improved  my teaching skills and helped  children learn faster. It gives  me immense joy to witness  the happiness of parents who  attend our monthly meetings.  Many even compare the  learning outcomes to those  of private preschools, while  also appreciating the reduced  financial pressure thanks to  government support.

Management  Discussion and  Analysis Economic Environment Global Economic Environment 1   The world economy suffered setbacks yet recorded steady growth of 3.3%, as weak  performance in Europe was offset by strong expansion in the United States. Global inflation continued to moderate, with an annual average down from 6.6% in  CY2023 to 5.7% in CY2024, driven primarily by advanced economies returning toward  their inflation targets. The US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates, to stimulate liquidity  into the economy, by 25 basis points for a total cut of one percentage point over the past  year, bringing rates to 4.25–4.50%. Governments across the globe have taken selective policies, such as financing  infrastructure development, widening social protection programs and providing incentives  to businesses-to shore up their economies and insulate from geopolitical shocks. Investor  sentiment was subdued by Middle Eastern and European geopolitical tensions, weaker  growth in China and policy changes in the US, as indicated by increasing bond yields in  most advanced economies.  1 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/04/22/world-economic-out look-april-2025 NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    80 

In developed economies, governments have introduced  structural changes that harness digital technologies and  green investments to tackle demographic changes and  productivity differentials. At the same time, emerging and  developing economies have registered sustained growth,  boosted by softening inflationary pressures and strong  manufacturing bases. Outlook Global GDP growth is projected to moderate to 2.8% in  2025 and 3% in 2026 term as policy makers adapt policy  and trade uncertainty continues. Ongoing disinflation is  anticipated amid a slowing labour market and decreasing oil  prices owing to increased output and weak Chinese demand,  potentially triggering divergence between European and US  central bank monetary policies. Global headline inflation is  expected to decline to 4.2% in 2025 and further to 3.5% in  2026. According to the IMF, inflation in advanced economies  is anticipated to return to central bank targets, in contrast to  emerging and developing economies, where inflation may  persist at higher levels. Healthy aging policies, technological innovation, and increased  labour force participation-particularly among older workers  and women-can reduce fiscal pressures and promote growth.  Keeping credible monetary and fiscal policies in place will  anchor inflation expectations in all economies. Sound budget  management is necessary to maintain financial buffers,  and investment in robust infrastructure can raise long-term  productivity. Structural changes combined with increased  international cooperation will guide through uncertainty,  leading to both domestic and global economic stability on a  more sustainable growth trajectory.

Urban consumption has moderated, with  rural demand holding up due to strong agricultural production.  The services sector drove the growth again, while manufacturing  exports in high-value sectors like electronics, semiconductors,  defence products, and pharmaceuticals remained robust  despite supply chain interruptions in the Red Sea. Fiscal control maintained the deficit at 4.4-4.5% of GDP, leaving  room for further government expenditure to propel demand. A  rise in funds for the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)  will increase health insurance coverage, adding to demand for  healthcare services. Investment in infrastructure increased by  38.8% from FY2020 to FY2025, and although capital spending  in the first half of FY2025 was restrained, increased outlays  later this year are forecast to boost demand and induce  private investment. 81 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Outlook In the future, India will continue to be among the global fastest- growing economies, with its growth picking up pace on the  back of declining inflation, good monsoons, and robust rural  consumption. GDP growth is projected at 6.5% in FY2026  on the back of substantial income tax subsidy in the Union  Budget and higher consumer expenditure due to the 8 th  Pay  Commission. Retail inflation is expected to stabilise around  4%, remaining within the RBI’s target range. Ongoing trade tensions and volatile tariffs can constrain export  growth and discourage business investment. Supply chain  resilience and foreign direct investment diversification will be  critical to maintaining export momentum. At home, policies  that raise labour-force participation, improve skills training,  and raise rural incomes can enhance productivity. Improved  migrant integration and targeted upskilling initiatives will also  ease potential workforce shortages. Prudent fiscal policies, wider financial inclusion, and more  robust digital infrastructure can sustain buffers against potential  shocks. Collective action on trade and investment across the  globe, along with coherent and credible policy, will be essential  to sustaining external stability and ensuring a sustained path  towards inclusive, sustainable growth.

Global medicine spending, the amount spent purchasing  medicines from manufacturers before off-invoice discounts  and rebates, is expected to reach US$ 2.3 Trillion by 2028 -  growth rate of 6-9% per year. Key drivers of growth through the  forecast period include the contribution of new products and  the impact of patent expiries, including the growing impact of  biosimilars. Higher adoption of speciality medicines for treating  chronic, complex or rare conditions in the developed markets  and volume-driven growth in the pharmerging markets would  also be key pillars of growth US Pharmaceutical Industry 5   The US pharmaceutical market is estimated at $ 639 billion in  2024 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.15% from 2024  to 2033, reaching around $ 1,093 billion by 2033.  The United  States is the world leader in spending on prescription drugs  per capita, accounting for approximately 30-40% of the global  market and approximately 45% of the world's pharmaceutical  sales and producing 22% of all medications. Federal policies  like the Affordable Care Act and the BIOSECURE Act will have  transformative impact on the industry. In the U.S. market for  pharmaceuticals, the transformative clinical outcomes of GLP- 1 receptor agonists and GLP-1/GIP dual agonists, have set a  new benchmark for obesity treatment.  These medications, such  as semaglutide and tirzepatide, have demonstrated weight loss  of up to 25%, significantly outperforming earlier drug classes,  which achieved only about 7% weight reduction. The approval  of cutting-edge drugs such as CAR-T cell therapies for certain  cancers exemplifies the market's growing focus on precision  medicine, offering hope for previously untreatable conditions. A  notable advancement is the continued progression in immuno- oncology treatments, which are redefining cancer care. The  growing market adoption of innovative and modern medicines  is another key driver of the U.S. pharmaceutical market. The  uptake of biologics, gene therapies, and immunotherapies in  oncology, autoimmune diseases, and other areas has been  particularly notable. 5 https://www.biospace.com/u-s-pharmaceutical-market-size-to-reach-usd-1-093-79- billion-by-2033 Source: S&P Global Outlook The future of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry in the next five  years is defined by continued innovation and major regulatory  reforms. Expansion will be driven by innovation in such areas  as oncology, obesity and new-generation biotherapeutics,  whereas diabetes and immunology spending will decelerate  with more competition from biosimilars and pricing pressures.  While new product launches will continue to add to market  growth, the rate of overall growth is slowing as large patent  expirations and the launch of biosimilars chip away at  exclusivity benefits. The Inflation Reduction Act and other policy initiatives are likely  to rein in price growth and squeeze profit margins modestly,  but not radically, as legislators are still sensitive to the need  to reward research and development. The incorporation  of new manufacturing technologies, including continuous  manufacturing, is improving efficiency and enabling more  rapid drug introductions. In the face of reputational issues  and bipartisan support for additional drug pricing reforms,  the industry is using scientific advancements and regulatory  pragmatism to keep pace competitively and bring new therapies  to market. Overall, the U.S. pharma sector is positioned for  steady, innovation-fuelled growth tempered with continued  cost containment and policy oversight. Key trends in Pharma Advancements in Biologics, Biosimilars and Personalized  MedicineThe increased chronic disease prevalence has  created the need for personalized medicines, biosimilars, and  biologics, leading to improved patient outcomes. The ongoing  innovations in biologics, target drugs, and gene therapies are  driving market growth. Economic and Pricing Pressures Payers and governments are using various treatment alternatives  to make deeper discounts, while precision therapies address  smaller patient populations. International trade tensions and  policy disruptions led by the US have also influenced investor  sentiment. This change diminishes conventional pricing power  and challenges pharma companies to reframe their cost  structure and value propositions. Digital Transformation in R&D and Patient Engagement Artificial intelligence will find approximately 30 percent of new  medicines in 2025, reducing preclinical times and costs by  as much as half. Analytics powered by AI reduce candidate  selection to a smooth-running process, optimise clinical trials  and facilitate personalised treatment regimens. At the same  time, digital solutions-digital health, mobile applications and  wearables are engaging patients in symptom monitoring,  improving adherence and sharing data in real-time. 2005 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 No. of approvals 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    84

Digitalisation and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine  learning (ML) are anticipated to revolutionise drug discovery,  clinical development, manufacturing, and supply chain  management. Regulatory simplification, quality improvement,  and sustainable manufacturing are also recognised as key  enablers for future growth. Meanwhile, the nation is afflicted  by an increasing burden of metabolic dysfunction-associated  steatosis liver disease (MASLD) due to obesity, diabetes,  physical inactivity and insulin resistance among non-drinkers  as well which will further accelerate demand for medication. India's API export business is projected to rise to $22 billion by  2030 at a CAGR of 8.3%, driven by changes in global supply  chains and policy initiatives. 18   The biotech industry, with more  than 800 core firms and a thriving startup ecosystem, is ready  for faster growth, further consolidating India's biopharma  capabilities. 19   Strong private equity and venture capital  investments are driving innovation and capacity augmentation. Crop health sciences About 2.5 billion individuals in the developing world depend  on agriculture for their livelihoods. Small farms in countries like  India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa contribute about 35% of  global production of staple grains-corn, soybean, wheat, and  rice. Though their contribution is large, these farmers hardly  have access to modern technology, formal training in agronomy,  and timely knowledge on climate change, pests, and diseases  of plants. Such a knowledge deficit limits them to expand their  output and adjust to changing agricultural challenges.  The real Gross Value Added of the Indian agricultural sector  has increased by almost double, and agricultural budgetary  expenditures have increased more than ten times to  H 1,22,528  crore during FY2024-25. The Indian government has taken  several steps to improve crop health and promote the agriculture  sector. The key reforms involve regular MSP hikes, currently a  minimum of 50% higher than production levels, and income  support under PM-KISAN, covering over 11 crore farmers. The  Agricultural Infrastructure Fund has facilitated investments of  H 86,798 crore for post-harvest and community infrastructure.  Digital programs such as e-NAM have connected markets,  covering 1.79 crore farmers and facilitating transparent  trade. Efforts of recent years also include research and seed  improvement, dairy and livestock sector development, and  missions for self-sufficiency in horticulture and pulses. 20   Crop protection usage in India stands at 0.37 kg/hectare.  H  2  lakh crores worth of crop yield is lost annually due to pests.  State governments play a key role in enabling ease of doing  business and ease of doing agriculture. India now stands as  the 2 nd  largest exporter of agrochemicals globally, after China,  making it a key participant in the global crop protection industry.  Introduction and use of safe, man-made crop-protection  products have eased some of the limitations in agriculture.  Through the reduction of crop loss to pests and diseases,  estimated at some 45% of gross production in the past, these  inputs allow farmers to capture a larger proportion of their  possible harvest. Outlook With increasing global demand for food, smallholder farmers will  have to almost double their crop production by 2050 to sustain  rural prosperity and ensure food security. Greater availability of  such solutions, combined with directed training and information  services, can also enable smallholders to increase productivity  and contribute more to world food supplies. The India agrochemicals market size from USD 5.4 billion in 2023  is forecast to increase by USD 17 billion at a CAGR of 11.8%  between 2024 and 2029. 21   Climate change and crop monitoring  have emerged as major threats to growth, leading to the use  of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), drone  monitoring, and data analysis to maximise resource efficiency  and forecast yield variations. Farm mechanisation and digital  solutions are revolutionising practice, increasing efficiency in  seeding, irrigation, and pest control. The agrochemical industry  is changing via research-based innovations in formulation  and seed treatment, while brand loyalty and retail networks  drive distribution strategies. Sustainability initiatives focus on  integrated pest management (IPM), organic farming practices,  and water preservation measures to minimise environmental  footprint. At the same time, yield forecasting and quality  assurance systems ensure productivity is balanced with  ecological resilience as agrochemicals become essential but  responsive to market forces and climatic realities. 87 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Queries can be  submitted via our dedicated email ID:  grievanceredressal@natcopharma.co.in  or addressed by post to Natco House, Hyderabad.   Upon receipt, the Marketing Department logs the complaint and collects the relevant information and the support document  from the complainant before logging the complaint. Subsequently, they route it through the Quality Assurance for further  investigation. Since pharma companies do not market the product directly to the patients, direct surveys are avoided at best.  Whereas such feedbacks are regularly taken from the Doctors through PSUR. This is a regulatory approved practice.  following  established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Depending on the nature of the issue, departments such as Regulatory  Affairs and Product Development may also be involved. Natco also operates a robust Pharmacovigilance system in alignment  with national and international regulations to monitor and address adverse drug reactions and safety-related concerns.   Once investigations are complete, responses and resolution updates are shared with the complainant, and appropriate  corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) are taken to mitigate recurrence. This process ensures continuous improvement in  product quality and enhances consumer trust. 181 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of  NATCO Pharma Limited Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements Opinion We have audited the standalone financial statements of NATCO  Pharma Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the standalone  balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the standalone  statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive  income), standalone statement of changes in equity and  standalone statement of cash flows for the year then ended,  and notes to the standalone financial statements, including  material accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone  financial statements give the information required by the  Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and  give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of  the Company as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and other  comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its cash flows for  the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards  on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act.  Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in  the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent  of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with  the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the  standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act  and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the  Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key Audit Matter(s) Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone  financial statements of the current period. These matters were  addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial  statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and  we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Revenue Recognition See Note 3(d) and Note 23 to standalone financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Revenue is recognised when the control of the products being sold  has transferred to the customer. The Company has a large number of  customers operating in various geographies and sale contracts with  customers have a variety of different terms relating to the recognition  of revenue. Control is usually transferred upon shipment/ delivery  to/ upon receipt of goods by the customer, in accordance with the  delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customers. We identified the recognition of revenue from sale of products  as a key audit matter because the Company and its external  stakeholders focus on revenue as a key performance indicator.  There could be a risk that revenue is recognised before the  control has been transferred to the customer. The Company also enters into product supply agreements which  also requires revenue to be recognised on profit sharing basis in  certain cases. The nature of these arrangements are inherently  complex. Considering the complexity involved, recognition of  revenue from such contracts has also been considered as a key  audit matter. In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following  audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient  and appropriate audit evidence: 1.   Assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition  accounting policies by comparing with applicable  accounting standards. 2.   Tested design, implementation and operating effectiveness  of the Company’s key controls over measurement, timing  and recognition of revenue in accordance with customer  contracts. 3.   Performed substantive testing (including year-end cut- off testing) by selecting samples of revenue transactions  recorded during the year (and before and after the financial  year end), by verifying the underlying documents, which  included sales invoices, contracts and shipping documents,  as applicable. 185 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company routinely enters into development and  commercialisation arrangements relating to research and  development of new products in the pharmaceutical sector  including collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies  leading to recognition of revenue from sale of services.  Considering the complexity involved, recognition of revenue from  such contracts has also been considered as a key audit matter. 4.   We have verified the terms of the agreement, invoices,  confirmations and payments received by the Company for  revenues recognised during the year in relation to product  supply agreements. 5.   Analysed the terms of development and commercialisation  arrangements to determine that revenue is recognised for  the rights transferred under the contract having regard to  the performance obligations under the contract. 6.   Tested manual journals posted to revenue to identify  unusual transactions. The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company operates in a complex tax jurisdiction in India  with various tax exemptions available. The Company has paid  minimum alternate tax (MAT) under Section 115JB of the Income- tax Act, 1961. The MAT paid would be available as offset over a  period of 15 years. The MAT credit is recognised as a deferred  tax asset that will be available for offset when the Company pays  regular taxes under the provisions of Income-tax Act, 1961. In assessing whether the deferred tax assets will be realised,  the Company considers whether some portion or all of the  deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation  of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of  future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary  differences become deductible. The extent of recognition of  deferred tax asset on account of MAT credit requires significant  judgment regarding the Company’s future taxable income which  will result in utilisation of the MAT credit within the time limits  available under the applicable Income-tax laws and accordingly  the same has been considered as a key audit matter. In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the following  audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient  appropriate audit evidence: 1.   Tested the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of the Company’s key controls over  recognition of deferred tax asset relating to MAT credit. 2.   Challenged the key business assumptions like profit  margins in the foreseeable future years against historical  data and trends, to assess their reasonableness. 3.   Analysed origination of MAT credit entitlement and assessed  the reasonableness of Company’s assessment in relation  to its utilisation within the period allowed for carry forward  and set off against foreseeable forecast taxable income  streams. 4.   Evaluated appropriateness of taxation disclosures in the  financial statements, including the disclosures made in  respect of the utilisation period of deferred tax assets in  relation to MAT credit entitlement. Deferred tax asset on Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) credit entitlement See Note 30 (D) and (E) to standalone financial statements Impairment of Property, plant and equipment of Agro chemicals segment (identified as cash generating  unit (‘CGU’) See Note 5 to standalone financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company has significant property, plant and equipment  with respect to Agro Chemical Segment (‘CGU’). Owing to the  continuous losses in the CGU, there is a risk of impairment that  the carrying amount of the aforesaid assets are lower than its  recoverable value. In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the following  audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient  appropriate audit evidence: 1.   Tested the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of the Company’s key controls over  impairment analysis of CGU. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    186 

The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The identification of impairment event and the determination of  impairment charge requires application of significant judgement by  the Company. The value in use is determined based on a discounted  cash flow model. It involves making certain assumptions, in  particular, with respect to the timing and amount of future cash  flows of the asset and using estimates like long term growth rate  and applicable discounting rates, due to the inherent uncertainty  and judgment in forecasting and discounting future cash flows. Accordingly, impairment assessment of property, plant and  equipment in the CGU is identified as a key audit matter. 2.   Tested budgeting procedures upon which the cash flow  forecasts were based. We also compared the actual past  performances with the budgeted figures. 3.   Involved valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating  the key assumptions and methodology used by the  Company, in particular those relating to the forecast of the  revenue growth, profit margins, terminal growth rate and  discount rate. The valuation specialists also compared the  assumptions to externally derived data in relation to key  inputs such as projected economic growth, competition,  cost of inflation and discount rates. 4.   Assessed the sensitivity of the outcome of impairment  assessment to changes in key assumptions. 5.   Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in accordance  with the applicable accounting standards. Other Information The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the other information. The other information  comprises the information included in the annual report, but  does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report  thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to  us after the date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not  cover the other information and we will not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated. When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a  material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate  the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary  actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations. Management's and Board of Directors'  Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial  Statements The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act  with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial  statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs,  profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in  equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the  accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section  133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions  of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection  and application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, the  Management and Board of Directors are responsible for  assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and  using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board  of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the  Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to  issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  187 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also: 	   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud  or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The  risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 	   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the company has adequate internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements in  place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 	   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by the Management and  Board of Directors. 	   Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis  of accounting in preparation of standalone financial  statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If  we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are  required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the standalone financial statements  or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our  opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence  obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,  future events or conditions may cause the Company to  cease to continue as a going concern.  	   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the standalone financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the standalone financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement  that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements  regarding independence, and to communicate with them  all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be  thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,  related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter  should not be communicated in our report because the adverse  consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to  outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements and such internal financial controls were operating  effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements  criteria established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the  “Guidance Note”). Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are  responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial  controls based on the internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include  the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate  internal financial controls that were operating effectively for  ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,  including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding  of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors,  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,  and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as  required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements  based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with  the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed  under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to  an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements were established and maintained and if such  controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements and their operating  effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements included obtaining an  understanding of internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based on  the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the standalone financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    196 

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial Statements A company's internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements is a process designed to provide  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of financial statements for  external purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls  with Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements to future  periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of  compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) 1.   Reporting entity information   NATCO Pharma Limited  (“the Company”) is a public  limited company domiciled in India with its registered  office situated at NATCO House, Road No. 2, Banjara  Hills, Hyderabad – 500034. The Company has been  incorporated under the provisions of Companies Act,  1956 and its equity shares are listed on the National Stock  Exchange (NSE) and BSE Limited (BSE) in India.   The Company is engaged in the business of pharmaceuticals  and agricultural chemicals which comprises research  and development, manufacturing and selling of bulk  drugs, finished dosage formulations. The Company has  manufacturing facilities in India which caters to both  domestic and international markets including regulated  markets like United States of America and Europe. 2.   Basis of preparation A.   Statement of Compliance   These standalone financial statements of the Company  have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (“Ind AS”) as per the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules 2015, as amended, notified under Section  133 of Companies Act, 2013, (the 'Act') and other relevant  provisions of the Act under the historical cost convention  on an accrual basis and going concern except for certain  financial instruments which are measured at fair values,  notified under the Act and Rules prescribed thereunder.   The standalone financial statements for the year ended 31  March 2025 were authorised and approved for issue by  the Company’s Board of Directors on 28 May 2025.   Details of Company’s accounting policies are  included in Note 3. B.   Functional and presentation currency   These standalone financial statements are presented in  Indian Rupee (‘INR’ or ‘₹’) which is also the Company’s  functional currency. All amounts have been rounded- off to the nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.  Transactions and balances with values below the rounding  off norm adopted by the Company have been reflected as  ‘0’ in relevant notes in the standalone financial statements. C.   Operating cycle   The Company has ascertained its operating cycle as  12 months that is the time between the acquisition of  assets for processing and their realisation in cash or  cash equivalents. D.   Basis of Measurement   These standalone financial statements have been  prepared on the historical cost basis except for the  following items which are measured on an alternative  basis on each reporting date: Items Measurement basis Certain financial  assets and liabilities Fair value Net defined benefit  asset/ (liability) Fair value of plan assets less  present value of defined benefit Leases Obligations (Refer Note 20) Lease liability is measured at the  present value of the remaining  lease payments, discounted using  the lessee’s incremental borrowing  rate at the date of initial application. Right-to-use asset has been  measured as an amount equal to  the lease liability, adjusted by the  amount of any prepaid or accrued  lease payments relating to that lease  recognised in the balance sheet  immediately before the date of initial  application. Practical expedient on  transition to exclude initial direct  costs from ROU asset measurement  is considered. (Refer Note 41) E.   Use of estimates and judgements   In preparing these standalone financial statements,  Management has made judgements, estimates and  assumptions that affect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,  income and expenses. Actual results may differ from  the estimates.    Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised prospectively.    Refer Note 4 for the estimates and judgments made in  preparation of these standalone financial statements. F.   Measurement of fair values   A number of the Company’s accounting policies and  disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for  both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. 203 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   The Company has an established control framework with  respect to the measurement of fair values. The finance  team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs  and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such  as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure  fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence  obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion  that these valuations meet the requirements of the  Accounting Standards, including the level in the fair value  hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.   Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair  value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation  techniques as follows:   -   Level 1:  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets  for identical assets or liabilities.   -   Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included  in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or  liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e.  derived from prices).   -   Level 3:  inputs for the asset or liability that  are not based on observable market data  (unobservable inputs).   When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the  Company uses observable market data as far as possible.  If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or  a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy,  then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety  in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest  level input that is significant to the entire measurement.   The Company recognises transfers between levels of the  fair value hierarchy at the end of reporting period during  which the change has occurred. G.   Current/ Non-current classification   Based on the time involved between acquisition of assets  for processing and their realisation of cash and cash  equivalents, the Company has identified twelve months as  it operating cycle for determining current and non-current  classification of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. 3.   Material accounting policies a.   Property, plant and equipment (PPE)   Recognition and initial measurement   The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall  be recognised as an asset if, and only if it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.   Items of property, plant and equipment (including capital- work-in progress) are measured at cost (which includes  capitalised borrowing costs, if any) less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if  any. Freehold land is carried at historical cost less any  accumulated impairment losses.   Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes  its purchase price, duties, taxes, after deducting trade  discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of  bringing the item to its working condition for its intended  use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the  item and restoring the site on which it is located.   The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and  equipment comprises the cost of materials, direct labour  and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the  item to its intended working condition and estimated  costs of dismantling, removing and restoring the site on  which it is located, wherever applicable.   If significant parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, then they are  accounted for as separate items (major components)  of property, plant and equipment. Any gain or loss on  disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is  recognised in profit or loss.   Transition to Ind AS   The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 April  2016, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS was  determined with reference to its carrying value recognized  as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of  transition to Ind AS   Subsequent expenditure   Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable  that the future economic benefits associated with the  expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost can be  measured reliably.   Depreciation   Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property,  plant and equipment less their estimated residual value  using straight line method over the useful lives of assets  estimated by the Company. Depreciation rates followed  by the Company coincides with rates prescribed in  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    204 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) amount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  Depreciation for assets purchased / sold during the period  is proportionately charged i.e. from/(upto) the date on  which asset is ready for use/(disposed off).   The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and  equipment are as follows: Assets Management’s  Estimated  useful life   (in years) Useful life as  per Schedule II    (in years) Buildings 5 to 60 5 to 60 Plant and machinery 5 to 20 5 to 20 Computers 3 to 6 3 to 6 Vehicles 8 to 10 8 to 10 Office equipment 5 5 Furniture and fixtures 10 10   Freehold land is not depreciated.   The residual values, useful lives and methods of  depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed  at each reporting date and adjusted prospectively,  if appropriate.   De-recognition   An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant  part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected from its  use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition  of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset)  is included in the Statement of profit and loss, when the  asset is derecognised.   Capital work-in-progress   Capital work-in-progress includes cost of property, plant  and equipment under installation / under development as  at the balance sheet date. b.   Other Intangible assets   Recognition and measurement   Other Intangible assets (software) acquired separately  are measured on initial recognition at their cost. The cost  comprises purchase price, borrowing cost if capitalisation  criteria are met and costs directly attributable cost of  bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended  use. Any trade discount and rebates are deducted in  arriving at the purchase price.   Following initial recognition, other intangible assets are  measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any  accumulated impairment losses.   Amortisation   Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of  intangible assets less their estimated residual values  using the straight line method over their useful lives and is  generally recognized in depreciation and amortisation in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.   The cost of capitalised software is amortised over a period  of 6 years and the Abbreviated New Drug Application  (‘ANDA’) acquired are amortised over a period of 10 years,  on a straight-line basis. Amortisation on the addition/ disposals is charged on pro-rata basis from/(until) the  date of such addition/(disposal).   Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values  are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted  if appropriate.   Transition to Ind AS   The cost of intangible assets at 1 April 2016, the Company’s  date of transition to Ind AS was determined with reference  to its carrying value recognized as per the previous GAAP  (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS   Subsequent expenditure   Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it  increases the future economic benefits embodied in  the specific asset to which it relates and the cost can  be measured reliably. All other expenditure, including  expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands,  is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. c.   Foreign currencies   Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded  by the Company at its functional currency spot rates at  the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currency are translated at the  functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting  date. Exchange differences that arise on settlement of  monetary items or on reporting at each balance sheet  date are recognised as income or expenses in the period  in which they arise. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are  translated into the functional currency at the exchange  rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary  assets and liabilities which are carried at historical cost  205 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) denominated in a foreign currency are reported using  the exchange rates at the date of transaction. Foreign  currency exchange differences are generally recognised  in profit or loss, except foreign currency exchange  differences arising from the translation of the following  items which are recognised in OCI –   -   an investment in equity securities designated as at  FVOCI (except on impairment, in which case foreign  currency differences that have been recognised in  OCI are reclassified to profit or loss). d.   Revenue from Contracts with Customer   The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of  finished dosage formulations, active pharmaceutical  ingredients (APIs) and agricultural chemicals, including  niche and technically complex molecules.   The Company generates revenue from its ordinary  activities i.e. from sale of goods and services. A contract  in this context shall fulfill all of the following conditions:   -   Both the parties to the contract agree on  the contract terms   -   Performance obligation of each of the parties  is identifiable and there exists a commitment to  perform their respective obligations; and   -   The commercial substance or the purchase  consideration is measurable and the  collectability is probable.   Disaggregation of revenue   The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with  customers by the nature of sale i.e. manufactured and  traded goods of pharmaceutical or agro chemical products  and sale of service and geography. The Company believes  that this disaggregation best depicts how the nature,  amount, timing and uncertainty of Company’s revenues  and cashflows are affected by industry, market and other  economic factors.   Contract balances   The Company classifies the right to consideration in  exchange for sales of goods as trade receivables, advance  consideration as contract liability against payment and  unredeemable customer loyalty points as contract liability  against performance obligation.   The specific recognition criteria described below must  also be met before revenue is recognised:   Sale of goods:   Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when a promise  in a customer contract (performance obligation) has  been satisfied by transferring control over the promised  goods to the customer. Control is usually transferred  upon shipment, delivery to, upon receipt of goods by the  customer, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance  terms agreed with the customers. The amount of revenue  to be recognised is based on the consideration expected  to be received in exchange for goods, excluding trade  discounts, volume discounts, sales returns, where  applicable and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of  the government which are levied on sales such as goods  and services tax, etc., where applicable.   The Company from time to time enters into marketing  arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of  its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements,  the Company sells its products to the business partners at  a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the  arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which  is over and above the base purchase price. The profit  share is typically dependent on the business partner’s  ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any  reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms  of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require  the business partner to provide confirmation of units sold  and net sales or net profit computations for the products  covered under the arrangement.   Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is  recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products  to the business partners. The variable consideration i.e.  additional amount representing the profit share component  is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly  probable that a significant reversal will not occur.   At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates  the estimated transaction price (including updating  its assessment of whether an estimate of variable  consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully  the circumstances present at the end of the reporting  period and the changes in circumstances during the  reporting period.   Sale of services:   Revenue from sale of dossiers/ licenses/services, includes  in certain instances, certain performance obligations and  based on evaluation of whether or not these obligations  are in consequential or perfunctory, revenue is recognised  in accordance with the terms of the contracts with the  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    206 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) customers when the related performance obligation is  completed at point in time or spread over a period of time,  as applicable. These arrangements typically consist of an  initial upfront payment on inception of the agreement and  subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain  milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in  the agreement. Milestone payments which are contingent  on achieving certain milestones are recognised as  revenues either on achievement of such milestones or  over the performance period depending on the terms  of the contract.   The Company does not expect to have any contracts  where the period between the transfer of the promised  goods or services to the customer and payment by the  customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, it does  not require to adjust any of the transaction prices for the  time value of money. e.   Borrowing costs   Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including  exchange differences relating to foreign currency  borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an  adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection  with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly  attributable to the acquisition or construction of those  property, plant and equipment which necessarily takes a  substantial period of time to get ready for their intended  use are capitalised. All other borrowing costs are expensed  in the period in which they are incurred in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. f.   Government grants   Government grants are recognised where there is  reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and  all attached conditions will be complied with. When the  grant relates to revenue, it is recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods  to which they relate. When the grant relates to an asset,  it is presented as a reduction to the carrying value of  the related asset.   Export benefits available under prevalent schemes are  accrued in the year in which the goods are exported  and no significant uncertainty exist regarding its  ultimate collection. g.   Leases   At inception of a contract, the Company assesses  whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is,  or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to  control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in  exchange for consideration.   i.   Leases as a lessee     The Company applies a single recognition and  measurement approach for all leases, except for  short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.  The Company recognises lease liabilities to make  lease payments and right-of-use assets representing  the right to use the underlying assets.     The Company recognises right-of-use asset  representing its right to use the underlying asset for  the lease term at the lease commencement date.  The right-of-use assets is measured at cost which  comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for any lease payments made at or before  the commencement date, plus any initial direct  costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle  and remove the underlying asset or to restore the  underlying asset or the site on which it is located,  less any lease incentives received.     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using the straight-line method from the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of the  useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the  lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of  the underlying asset to the Company by the end of  the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset  reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase  option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be  depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset,  which is determined on the same basis as those of  property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use  asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if  any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the  lease liability. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised  in the Statement of profit and loss.     The Company measures the lease liability at the  present value of the lease payments that are not  paid at the commencement date of the lease. The  lease payments are discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily  determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined,  the Company uses incremental borrowing rate.  The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate  as the discount rate. The Company determines its  incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest  rates from various external financing sources and  207 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms  of the lease and type of the asset leased. For  leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the  Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt  either the incremental borrowing rate specific to  the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the  portfolio as a whole.     The lease payments include     -   fixed payments, including in  substance fixed payment;     -   variable lease payments that depend on an  index or a rate, initially measured using the  index or rate as at the commencement date;     -   amount expected to be payable under a  residual value guarantees,     -   exercise price of a purchase option where the  Company is reasonably certain to exercise that  option and payments of penalties for terminating  the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee  exercising an option to terminate the lease.     The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by  increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on  the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to  reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring  the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or  lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance  fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the  amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due  to modification as an adjustment to the right-of use  asset and Statement of profit and loss depending  upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero  and there is a further reduction in the measurement  of the lease liability, the Company recognises  any remaining amount of the re-measurement in  Statement of profit and loss.     The lease liability is measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest method. It is remeasured  when there is a change in future lease payments  arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is  a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount  expected to be payable under a residual value  guarantee, if the Company changes its assessment  of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension  or termination option or if there is a revised in- substance fixed lease payment.     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way,  a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero     The Company presents right-of-use assets in  ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities  in ‘Financial liabilities’ in the Balance sheet.     Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets     The Company has elected not to apply the  requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term  leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12  months or less and leases for which the underlying  asset is of low value. The lease payments associated  with these leases are recognised as an expense on a  straight-line basis over the lease term.   ii.   Leases as lessor     When the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at  lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease  or an operating lease.     To classify each lease, the Company makes an overall  assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially  all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of  the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease  is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease.  As part of this assessment, the Company considers  certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the  major part of the economic life of the asset.     When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it  accounts for its interests in the head lease and  the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease  classification of a sub-lease with reference to the  right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not  with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease  is a short-term lease to which the Company applies  the exemption described above, then it classifies the  sub-lease as an operating lease.     The Company recognises lease payments received  under operating leases as income on straight-line  basis over the lease term as part of ‘other income’. h.   Impairment of non-financial assets (Intangible  assets and property, plant and equipment)   At each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying  amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    208 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there  is any indication of impairment. If any such indication  exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful life are tested  annually for impairment.   For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable  amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell  and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset  basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that  are largely independent of those from other assets. In  such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the  cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. If such  assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment  to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss is  measured by the amount by which the carrying value of  the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of  the asset. Value in use is based on the estimated future  cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  of the time value of money and the risks specific to the  asset or cash generating unit.   An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit  and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates  used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying  amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable  amount, provided that this amount does not exceed  the carrying amount that would have been determined  (net of any accumulated amortisation or depreciation)  had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset  in prior years. i.   Financial instruments   i.   Recognition and Initial measurement     Trade receivables and debt securities issued are  initially recognised when they are originated. All other  financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  recognised when the Company becomes a party  to the contractual provisions of the instrument. At  the time of initial recognition, these financial assets  (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant  financing component) or financial liabilities are  measured at fair value. A trade receivable without a  significant financing component is initially measured  at the transaction price.     Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the  acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial  liabilities, that are not at fair value through profit or  loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.   ii.   Classification and subsequent measurement    Financial  assets     On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified  as measured at:    -   amortised  cost;     -   FVOCI – debt investment;     -   FVOCI – equity investment; or    -   FVTPL.     The Company classifies financial assets as  subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value  through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or  fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) on the  basis of following: 	   the entity’s business model for managing the  financial assets and 	   the contractual cash flow characteristics of the  financial asset.     Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent  to their initial recognition unless the Company  changes its business model for managing financial  assets, in which case all affected financial assets  are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting  period following the change in the business model.    Amortised  Cost:     A financial asset shall be classified and measured at  amortised cost if both of the following conditions are  met and is not designated as FVTPL: 	   the financial asset is held within a business  model whose objective is to hold financial assets  in order to collect contractual cash flows; and 	   the contractual terms of the financial asset give  rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.     Fair Value through OCI:     A financial asset shall be classified and measured  at fair value through OCI if both of the following  conditions are met and is not designated as FVTPL: 	   the financial asset is held within a business  model whose objective is achieved by both  209 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets; and 	   the contractual terms of the financial asset give  rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.     On initial recognition of an equity investment that is  not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably  elect to present subsequent changes in the  investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made  on an investment-by-investment basis.     Fair Value through Profit or Loss:     A financial asset shall be classified and measured at  fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured  at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI.     All recognised financial assets are subsequently  measured in their entirety at either amortised cost  or fair value, depending on the classification of the  financial assets.     Classification of investments:    a.   Debt instruments at amortised cost -  A ‘debt  instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost  if both the following conditions are met: 	   The asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for  collecting contractual cash flows, and 	   Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.       After initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.  Interest income, foreign exchange gains and  losses and impairment are recognised in profit  or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is  recognised in profit or loss.     b.   Equity investments -  All equity investments in  scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value.  Equity instruments which are held for trading  are classified at fair value through profit and loss  (FVTPL). For all other equity instruments, the  Company decides to classify the same either  as at fair value through other comprehensive  income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit  and loss (FVTPL). The Company makes such  election on an instrument by instrument basis.  The classification is made on initial recognition  and is irrevocable.       These assets are subsequently measured at  fair value. Dividends are recognised as income  in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly  represents a recovery of part of the cost of  the investment. Other net gains and losses are  recognised in OCI and are not reclassified to  profit or loss.    c.   Mutual funds -  All mutual funds in scope of  Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value through  profit and loss (FVTPL). Net gains and losses,  including any interest or dividend income, are  recognised in profit or loss.     Interest income and dividend income:     For all financial instruments measured at amortised  cost, interest income is recorded using the effective  interest rate (EIR). Interest income is included in  other income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly  discounts estimated future cash payments  or receipts through the expected life of the  financial instrument to:     -   the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or     -   the amortised cost of the financial liability     In calculating interest income and expense, the  effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying  amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit- impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.  However, for financial assets that have become  credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition,  interest income is calculated by applying the  effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the  financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit- impaired, then the calculation of interest income  reverts to the gross basis.     Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on  the date when the Company’s right to receive the  payment is established, which is generally when  shareholders approve the dividend. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    210 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)    Financial  liabilities     Financial liabilities are classified as measured  at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability  is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held- for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as  such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at  FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains  and losses, including any interest expense, are  recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method. Interest expense and  foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised  in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is  also recognised in profit or loss. For trade and other  payables maturing within one year from the balance  sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair  value due to the short maturity of these instruments.   iii.   De-recognition    Financial  assets     The Company derecognises a financial asset when  the contractual rights to the cash flows from the  financial asset expire, or it transfers the right to  receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in  which either substantially all of the risks and rewards  of ownership of the financial assets are transferred  or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains  substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership  and does not retain control of the financial asset.     If the Company enters into transactions whereby it  transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but  retains either all or substantially all of the risks and  rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred  assets are not derecognised.    Financial  liabilities     The Company derecognises a financial liability  when its contractual obligations are discharged or  cancelled or expire.     The Company also derecognises a financial liability  when its terms are modified and the cash flows under  the modified terms are substantially different. In this  case, a new financial liability based on the modified  terms is recognised at fair value. The difference  between the carrying amount of the financial liability  extinguished and a new financial liability with  modified terms is recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.   iv.   Offsetting     Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset  and the net amount presented in the balance sheet  when, and only when, the Company currently has a  legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it  intends either to settle them on a net basis or realise  the asset and settle the liabilities simultaneously.   v.   Financial guarantee contracts     Financial guarantee contracts are those contracts  that require a payment to be made to reimburse the  holder for a loss it incurs because the specified party  fails to make a payment when due in accordance with  the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee  contracts are recognised initially as a liability at  fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.  Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of  the amount of expected loss allowance determined  as per impairment requirements of Ind-AS 109 and  the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation. j.   Impairment of financial assets   The Company recognises loss allowances for ECLs on: 	   financial assets measured at amortised cost; 	   debt investments measured at FVOCI;   At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether  financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit –  impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental  impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial  asset have occurred.   Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes  the following observable data:   -   Significant financial difficulty of the borrower   -   a breach of contract;   -   it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy  or other financial reorganisation; or   -   the disappearance of an active market for a security  because of financial difficulties   The Company measures loss allowances at an amount  equal to lifetime expected credit losses.   Loss allowances for trade receivables, loans, contract  assets are always measured at an amount equal to  211 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit  losses are the expected credit losses that result from  all possible default events over the expected life of a  financial instrument.   12-month expected credit losses are the portion of  expected credit losses that result from default events that  are possible within 12 months after the reporting date (or a  shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less  than 12 months).   In all cases, the maximum period considered when  estimating expected credit losses is the maximum  contractual period over which the Company is exposed  to credit risk.   When determining whether the credit risk of a financial  asset has increased significantly since initial recognition  and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers  reasonable and supportable information that is relevant  and available without undue cost or effort. This includes  both quantitative and qualitative information and  analysis, based on the Company’s historical experience  and informed credit assessment, that includes forward- looking information.   Measurement of ECLs   ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses.  Credit losses are measured as the present value of all  cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows  due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the  cash flows that the Company expects to receive).   Write-off   The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written  off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no  realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case  when the Company determines that the debtors does not  have assets or sources of income that could generate  sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the  write off. However, financial assets that are written off  could still be subject to enforcement activities in order  to comply with the Company’s procedures for recovery  of amounts due. k.   Inventories   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable  value. The cost of inventories is determined on a moving  weighted average basis, and includes acquiring the  inventories, production or conversion costs and other  costs incurred in bringing them to their present location  and condition. In the case of raw materials and stock-in- trade, cost comprises of cost of purchase. In the case  of finished goods and work in progress, cost includes  an appropriate share of production overheads based on  normal operating capacity.   Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in  the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs  of completion and the estimated costs necessary  to make the sale.   The net realisable value of work-in-progress is determined  with reference to the selling prices of related finished  goods. Raw materials, components and other supplies  held for use in the production of finished products are not  written down below cost except in cases when a decline  in the price of materials indicates that the cost of the  finished products shall exceed the net realisable value.  The comparison of cost and net realisable value is made  on an item-by-Item basis.   The provision for inventory obsolescence is assessed  regularly based on estimated usage and shelf  life of products. l.   Income taxes   Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is  recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it  relates to an item recognised directly in equity or in other  comprehensive income. The Company has determined  that interest and penalties related to income taxes,  including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the  definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for  them under Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and Contingent Assets.   i.   Current tax     Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or  receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year  and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable  in respect of previous years. The amount of current  tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount  expected to be paid or received after considering  the uncertainty, if any related to income taxes. It is  measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or  substantively enacted by the reporting date.     Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there  is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised  amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and  settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    212 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   ii.   Deferred tax     Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary  differences between the carrying amounts of assets  and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the  corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes.     Deferred tax is not recognised for:     -   temporary differences arising on the initial  recognition of assets or liabilities in a  transaction that 	   is not a business combination and 	   at the time of the transaction (i) affects  neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss  and (ii) does not give rise to equal taxable  and deductible temporary differences     Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax  losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary  differences to the extent that it is probable that future  taxable profits will be available against which they  can be used. Future taxable profits are determined  based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary  differences. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each  reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it  is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will  be realised; such reductions are reversed when the  probability of future taxable profits improves.     Deferred tax assets recognised or unrecognised are  reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised  / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer  probable respectively that the related tax benefit  will be realised.     Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are  expected to apply to the period when the asset is  realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws  that have been enacted or substantively enacted by  the reporting date.     The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax  consequences that would follow from the manner in  which the Company expects, at the reporting date,  to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets  and liabilities.     The Company offsets, the current tax assets and  liabilities (on a year on year basis) and deferred  tax assets and liabilities, where it has a legally  enforceable right and where it intends to settle such  assets and liabilities on a net basis. Deferred tax  relating to items recognised outside profit or loss  is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other  comprehensive income or in equity). m.   Cash and cash equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand,  demand deposits with banks, other short-term highly  liquid investments with original maturities of three months  or less that are readily convertible into known amounts  of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value. n.   Post-employment, long-term and short-term  employee benefits   Defined contribution plan   A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit  under which an entity pays a specific contribution to a  separate entity and has no obligation to pay any further  amounts. The Company’s contribution to provident fund  and employee state insurance schemes is charged to the  Statement of profit and loss during the period in which  the employee renders the related service. The Company’s  contributions towards Provident Fund are deposited  with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner under a  defined contribution plan. The Company has no obligation,  other than the contribution payable to these funds.   Defined benefit plan   The Company has gratuity as defined benefit plan where  the amount that an employee will receive on retirement is  defined by reference to the employee’s length of service  and final salary. The liability recognised in the balance  sheet for defined benefit plans is the present value of the  defined benefit obligation (DBO) at the reporting date net of  fair value of plan assets. Management estimates the DBO  annually with the assistance of independent actuaries,  by adopting the projected unit credit method. Actuarial  gains and losses resulting from re-measurements of the  liability are included in other comprehensive income. The  Company determines the net interest expense (income)  on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period  by applying the discount rate determined by reference  to market yields at the end of the reporting period on  government bonds. Net interest expense and other  expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised  in profit or loss. 213 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   The Company has subscribed to a group gratuity scheme  of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Under the  said policy, the eligible employees are entitled for gratuity  upon their resignation, retirement or in the event of death  in lumpsum after deduction of necessary taxes upto a  maximum limit of ₹2 million. Liabilities in respect of the  Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation,  based upon which the Company makes contributions to  the Gratuity Fund.   Other long-term employee benefits   The Company also provides benefit of compensated  absences to its employees which are in the nature of long- term benefit plan. Liability in respect of compensated  absences becoming due and expected to be availed more  than one year after the balance sheet date is estimated  on the basis of an actuarial valuation performed by an  independent actuary using the projected unit credit  method as on the reporting date. Actuarial gains and  losses arising from experience adjustments and changes  in actuarial assumptions are recorded in the Statement of  profit or loss in the year in which such gains or losses arise.   Short-term employee benefits   Short-term employee benefits comprise of employee  costs such as salaries, bonus etc. is recognized on the  basis of the amount paid or payable for the period during  which services are rendered by the employee. Short-term  employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted  basis and expensed as the related service is provided. A  liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid  under short-term, if the Company has a present legal or  constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of  past service provided by the employee and the obligation  can be estimated reliably. o.   Share-based payments   Certain employees of the Company are entitled to  remuneration in the form of equity settled instruments, for  rendering services over a defined vesting period. Equity  instruments granted are measured by reference to the  fair value of the instrument at the date of grant using an  appropriate valuation model.   The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed  over the vesting period of the respective tranches of such  grants. The stock compensation expense is determined  based on the Company’s estimate of equity instruments  that will eventually vest using fair value in accordance with  Ind AS 102, Share based payment. The cost is recognised,  together with a corresponding increase in ‘Share options  outstanding account’ reserves in Equity, over the period  in which the performance and / or service conditions are  fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The dilutive effect  of outstanding options is reflected as additional share  dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share. p.   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent  assets   General   Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a  past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of the obligation. When the Company expects  some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the expense  relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of  Profit and Loss, net of any reimbursement.   If the effect of the time value of money is material,  provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate  that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the  liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the  provision due to the passage of time is recognised as  a finance cost.   Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets   Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from  past events and whose existence will be confirmed only  by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more  uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the  entity or a present obligation that arises from past events  but is not recognised because it is not probable that  an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits  will be required to settle the obligation or the amount  of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient  reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent  liability but discloses its existence in the consolidated  financial statements.   Contingent asset is not recognised in standalone financial  statements since this may result in the recognition of  income that may never be realised. However, when the  realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related  asset is not a contingent asset and is recognized.   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are  reviewed at each Balance Sheet date   Onerous contracts NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    214 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   Provision for onerous contracts. i.e. contracts where the  expected unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations  under the contract exceed the economic benefits  expected to be received under it, are recognised when  it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle a present  obligation as a result of an obligating event based on a  reliable estimate of such obligation.   A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the  present value of the lower of the expected cost of  terminating the contract and the expected net cost of  continuing with the contract, which is determined based  on the incremental costs of fulfilling the obligation under  the contract and an allocation of other costs directly  related to fulfilling the contract. Before a provision is  established, the Company recognises any impairment  loss on the assets associated with that contract q.   Earnings per share   Basic Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) is computed by dividing  the net profit attributable to the equity shareholders by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed  by dividing the net profit (considered in determination of  Basic EPS) after considering the effect of interest and  other financing costs or income (net of attributable taxes)  associated with the dilutive potential equity shares by the  weighted average number of equity shares considered for  deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been  issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity  shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  converted as of the beginning of the year, unless issued  at a later date. In computing diluted earnings per share,  only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that either  reduces earnings per share or increases loss per share are  included. The number of shares and potentially dilutive  equity shares are adjusted for bonus issue, bonus element  in a rights issue to existing shareholders, share split and  reverse share split (consolidation of shares) r.   Cash flow statement   Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby  net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of  transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or  accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and  items of income or expenses associated with investing or  financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue  generating (operating activities), investing and financing  activities of the Company are segregated. s.   Research and development   Expenditure on research activities are expensed as and when  incurred. Development expenses which meet defined criteria  for capitalisation are capitalised if its the expenditure can  be measured reliably, the product or process is technically  and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are  probable and the Company intends to and has sufficient  resources to complete development and to use or sell the  asset. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.  Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure  is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and  any accumulated impairment losses. Capital expenditure  incurred on research and development is capitalised  as property, plant and equipment and depreciated in  accordance with the depreciation policy of the Company. t.   Investments in subsidiaries   The Company’s investment in its subsidiaries are carried  at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where  an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of  the investment is assessed and written down immediately  to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments  in subsidiaries, the difference between net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the  profit or loss. u.   Events after reporting date   Where events occurring after the balance sheet date  provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of  the reporting period, the impact of such events is adjusted  within the standalone financial statements. Otherwise,  events after the balance sheet date of material size or  nature are only disclosed. v.   Recent accounting pronouncements   Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards  or amendments to the existing standards under Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time  to time. For the year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has  notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance Contracts and amendments  to Ind AS 116 –Leases, relating to sale and lease back  transactions, applicable to the Company w.e.f. April 1, 2024.  The Company has reviewed the new pronouncements and  based on its evaluation has determined that it does not have  any significant impact in its financial statements. 4.   Use of Judgements and estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity  with the Ind AS requires judgements, estimates and  215 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts  of assets and liabilities on the date of the financial  statements, the reported amounts of revenues and  expenses during the reporting period and the disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities as of the date of the  financial statements. Although these estimates are based  on the management’s best knowledge of current events  and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and  estimates could result in outcomes different from the  estimates. Difference between actual results and estimates  are recognised in the period in which the results are known  or materialise. Estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting  estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and  future periods.   Management considers the accounting estimates and  assumptions discussed below to be its critical accounting  estimates and, accordingly, provide an explanation  of each below. The discussion below should also be  read in conjunction with the Company’s disclosure  of Material accounting policies which are provided in  Note 3 to the standalone financial statements, ‘Material  accounting policies’.   Judgments:   Taxes on income:   Significant judgments are involved in determining the  provision for income taxes, including possibility of  utilisation of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit in  future. Refer Note 30.   Impairment of investments:   Significant judgment is involved in determining the  estimated future cash flows from the investments to  determine their value in use to assess whether there is  any impairment in their carrying amounts as reflected in  the standalone financial statements. Refer Note 8.   Impairment of property, plant and equipment   Significant judgment is involved in determining the  estimated future cash flows from the cash-generating unit  to determine their value in use to assess whether there is  any impairment in their carrying amounts as reflected in  the standalone financial statements. Refer Note 5.   Assumptions and estimation uncertainties:   Recognition of deferred tax assets –  The extent to  which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based  on an assessment of the probability of the Company’s  future taxable income against which the deferred tax  assets can be utilised. In addition, significant judgement is  required in assessing the impact of any legal or economic  limits. Refer Note 30.   Evaluation of indicators for impairment of assets:  The  evaluation of applicability of indicators of impairment  of assets requires assessment of several external and  internal factors which could result in deterioration of  recoverable amount of the assets.   Useful lives of property, plant and equipment/ intangible  assets:  Management reviews its estimate of the useful  lives of property, plant and equipment/ intangible assets  at each reporting date, based on the expected utility of  the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates relate to  technical and economic obsolescence that may change  the utility of certain software, IT equipment and other plant  and equipment. Refer Note 5 and Note 6.   Defined benefit obligation (DBO):  Management’s  estimate of the DBO is based on a number of critical  underlying assumptions such as standard rates of  inflation, mortality, discount rate and anticipation of  future salary increases. Variation in these assumptions  may significantly impact the DBO amount and the annual  defined benefit expenses. Refer Note 20.   Fair value measurements:  Management applies  valuation techniques to determine the fair value of  financial instruments (where active market quotes are  not available) and non-financial assets. This involves  developing estimates and assumptions consistent with  how market participants would price the instrument.  Management uses the best information available.  Estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that  would be achieved in an arm’s length transaction at the  reporting date. Refer Note 32.   Provisions:  The Company exercises judgement in  measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures  to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or  other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement,  mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well  as other contingent liabilities. Judgement is necessary  in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will  succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the  possible range of the financial settlement. Because of  the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual  losses may be different from the originally estimated  provision. Refer Note 20. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    216

Under the said policy,  the eligible employees are entitled for gratuity upon their resignation, retirement or in the event of death in lumpsum after  deduction of necessary taxes up to a maximum limit of ₹2. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an  actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. The defined benefit plans  expose the Company to actuarial risk, interest rate risk and investment risk etc.   Interest Rate Risk:  The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an  increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of liability.   Liquidity Risk:  This is the risk that the Company is not able to meet the short-term gratuity payouts. This may arise due to non  availability of enough cash/cash equivalent to meet the liabilities or holding of illiquid assets not being sold in time.   Investment Risk:  The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment.   The Gratuity plan is administered through Group Gratuity Scheme with Life Insurance Corporation of India ('LIC'). Every  employee who has completed five years or more of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days salary (last drawn salary)  for each completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months.   The Company has determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the gratuity plan, and in accordance with  statutory requirements (including minimum funding requirements) of the plan of the relevant jurisdiction, the present value of  refund or reduction in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the total fair value of the plan assets less the total  present value of obligations. As such, no decrease in the defind benefit asset is necessary at 31 March 2025 (31 March 2024:  no decrease in defined benefit asset). Project unit credit method has been used for valuation.   The following tables sets out the status of the gratuity plan and the reconciliation of opening and closing balances of the  present value and defined benefit obligation:   (i)   Reconciliation of the present value of defined benefit obligation As at   31-03-2025 As at   31-03-2024 Opening balance  850   733  Current service cost  87   75  Interest cost   61   55  Benefits paid   (42)  (47) NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    232

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   The Company’s financial liabilities comprise of borrowings from banks, trade payables and other financial liabilities. The main  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include  loans, trade receivables, other financial assets, cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances that derive directly from  its operations. The Company also holds certain investments in entities other than in subsidiaries.   The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, trade receivables, loans, investment in quoted and unquoted  debentures and bonds, borrowings, trade payables, other financial assets and other financial liabilities approximate their  carrying amount largely due to the nature of these instruments. The Company's loans have been contracted at market rates  of interest. Accordingly, the carrying value of such loans approximate fair value. B.   Measurement of fair values   Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs   Level 1:  The fair value of the quoted equity investments are based on market price at the reporting date.   Level 3:  The Investments measured at fair value and falling under fair value hierarchy Level 3 are valued on the basis of  valuation reports provided by valuers with the exception of certain investments, where the impact of fair valuation of investment  is considered as insignificant and hence carrying value and fair value is considered as same. The valuers have considered  discounted cashflow method for the purpose of valuation of investments. The significant unobservable inputs involved are  primarily growth rate, discount rate and terminal growth rate. The relationship of significant unobservable value and fair  value is as follows:   the estimated fair value will increase/(decrease) if the expected growth rate and terminal rate increases/(decreases);   the estimated fair value will (decrease)/increase if the expected discount rate increases/(decreases)"   Transfer between Level 1 and 2   There have been no transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 or vice-versa in 2024-25 and no transfers in either direction in 2023-24.

Financial risk management The Board of Directors of the Company has overall responsibility for the establishment and deployment of risk management  framework. The Board of Directors have adopted a Risk Policy, which empowers the management to access and monitor the risk  management parameters along with action taken and the same is updated to Board of Directors. The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks being faced by the Company, to set  appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are  reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and  management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees  understand their roles and obligations.

The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and adhoc reviews of  risk management controls and procedures, the result of which are reported to the Audit Committee.  A.   Market risk:   Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk comprises two types of risks: interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments affected by  market risk include borrowings, deposits, loans, trade receivables and trade payables.   i.   Interest rate risk     Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  in market interest rates. The Company's entire borrowings carried at amortised cost are variable rate instruments and  are subject to fluctuation because of a change in market interest rates. The Company considers the impact of fair value  interest rate risk on variable rate borrowings as not material.     The Company’s variable rate borrowing is subject to interest rate risk. Below are the details of exposure to fixed rate and  variable rate instruments:     Sensitivity-Interest rate risk     The interest rate sensitivity is based on the closing balance of loans from banks.   ii.   Foreign currency risk:     Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes  in foreign exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is mismatch between the  currencies in which sales, purchase are denominated and the respective functional currencies of the Company. The  Company exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s operating activities. 249 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

These are  realised amounts and hence, there is no further foreign currency risk involved.     Foreign currency sensitivity     A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the Indian Rupee against various foreign currencies at 31 March  would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and affected equity  and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates,  remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases.

Credit risk   Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet  its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers and loans given. Credit  risk arises from cash held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients, including outstanding  accounts receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. The objective  of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Company assesses the credit quality of the  counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.   Trade and other receivables:   The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics  of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on  credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring  the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.   Impairment losses on financial assets and contract assets recognised in profit or loss were as follows.   The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables (Gross) by geographic region is as follows:   The above exposure does not include unbilled revenue.  251 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Notes to standalone Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) C.   Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial  liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to  ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and  stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.   Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of  expected cash flows. The Company takes into account the liquidity of the market in which the entities operates. In addition,  the Company’s liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level  of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory  requirements and maintaining debt financing plans.   The Company's principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from operations. The Company has no long- term borrowings and believes that the working capital loan is sufficient for its current requirements. Accordingly, no liquidity  risk is perceived.   Maturities of financial liabilities   The tables below analyse the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual  maturities for all non-derivative financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash  flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is insignificant.

Pending resolution of the  aforesaid respective proceedings, it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any, in  respect of the above.   (ii)   The Company is contesting certain process and product patent infringement cases filed against it by the innovators  in the ordinary course of business. A few of these cases pertain to products already launched by the Company in the  market. These cases are pending before different authorities / courts and most of the claims involve complex issues.  The outcome from these claims are uncertain due to a number of factors involved in legal trial such as stage of the  proceedings and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal  a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the  possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. Often, these issues  are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount  of any loss is difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable  estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. Further, at  present, the management does not expect such liabilities to be significant.   (iii)   The Company has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has adequately provided for where provisions  are required and disclosed as contingent liabilities where applicable, in its standalone financial statements. The Company  does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position. 39.  The Company does not have any long-term contracts including derivatives for which there are any material foreseeable losses. 259 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Independent Auditor’s Report The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Revenue is recognised when the control of the products being sold  has transferred to the customer. The Group has a large number of  customers operating in various geographies and sale contracts with  customers have a variety of different terms relating to the recognition  of revenue. Control is usually transferred upon shipment/ delivery  to/ upon receipt of goods by the customer, in accordance with the  delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customers. We identified the recognition of revenue from sale of products as a  key audit matter because the Group and its external stakeholders  focus on revenue as a key performance indicator. There could  be a risk that revenue is recognised before the control has been  transferred to the customer. In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following  audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient  and appropriate audit evidence: 1.   Assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition  accounting policies by comparing with applicable  accounting standards. 2.   Tested design, implementation and operating effectiveness  of the Group’s key controls over measurement, timing and  recognition of revenue in accordance with customer contracts. 3.   Performed substantive testing (including year-end cut- off testing) by selecting samples of revenue transactions  recorded during the year (and before and after the financial  year end), by verifying the underlying documents, which  included sales invoices, contracts and shipping documents,  as applicable. To the Members of  NATCO Pharma Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of  NATCO Pharma Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding  Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its  subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which  comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2025,  and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including  other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of  changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows  for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial  statements, including material accounting policies and  other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the  consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated  financial statements give the information required by the  Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and  give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state  of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2025, of its consolidated  profit and other comprehensive loss, consolidated changes in  equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our  responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent  of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that  are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements  in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of  the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit  evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of reports  of the other auditor(s) referred to in paragraph (a) of the “Other  Matter” section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current period. These  matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming  our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters. Revenue Recognition See Note 3(e) and Note 22 to consolidated financial statements NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    266 

The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Holding company operates in a complex tax jurisdiction in  India with various tax exemptions available. The Holding company  has paid minimum alternate tax (MAT) under Section 115JB of  the Income-tax Act, 1961. The MAT paid would be available as  offset over a period of 15 years. The MAT credit is recognised as a  deferred tax asset that will be available for offset when the Holding  company pays regular taxes under the provisions of Income-tax  Act, 1961. In assessing whether the deferred tax assets will be realised, the  Holding company considers whether some portion or all of the  deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation  of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of  future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary  differences become deductible. The extent of recognition of  deferred tax asset on account of MAT credit requires significant  judgment regarding the Holding company’s future taxable income  which will result in utilisation of the MAT credit within the time limits  available under the applicable Income-tax laws and accordingly  the same has been considered as a key audit matter. In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the following  audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient  appropriate audit evidence: 1.   Tested the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of the Holding company’s key controls over  recognition of deferred tax asset relating to MAT credit. 2.   Challenged the key business assumptions like profit  margins in the foreseeable future years against historical  data and trends, to assess their reasonableness. 3.   Analysed origination of MAT credit entitlement and assessed  the reasonableness of Holding company’s assessment in  relation to its utilisation within the period allowed for carry  forward and set off against foreseeable forecast taxable  income streams. 4.   Evaluated appropriateness of taxation disclosures in the  financial statements, including the disclosures made in  respect of the utilisation period of deferred tax assets in  relation to MAT credit entitlement. The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group also enters into product supply agreements which  also requires revenue to be recognised on profit sharing basis in  certain cases. The nature of these arrangements are inherently  complex. Considering the complexity involved, recognition of  revenue from such contracts has also been considered as a key  audit matter. The Group routinely enters into development and commercialisation  arrangements relating to research and development of new  products in the pharmaceutical sector including collaboration  with other pharmaceutical companies leading to recognition  of revenue from sale of services. Considering the complexity  involved, recognition of revenue from such contracts has also  been considered as a key audit matter. 4.   We have verified the terms of the agreement, invoices,  confirmations and payments received by the Group for  revenues recognised during the year in relation to product  supply agreements. 5.   Analysed the terms of development and commercialisation  arrangements to determine that revenue is recognised for  the rights transferred under the contract having regard to  the performance obligations under the contract. 6.   Tested manual journals posted to revenue to identify  unusual transactions. Deferred tax asset on Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) credit entitlement See Note 29 (D) and (E) to consolidated financial statements 267 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Holding company has significant property, plant and  equipment with respect to Agro Chemical Segment (‘CGU’). Owing  to the continuous losses in the CGU, there is a risk of impairment  that the carrying amount of the aforesaid assets are lower than its  recoverable value. The identification of impairment event and the determination of  impairment charge requires application of significant judgement  by the Holding company. The value in use is determined based  on a discounted cash flow model. It involves making certain  assumptions, in particular, with respect to the timing and amount  of future cash flows of the asset and using estimates like long term  growth rate and applicable discounting rates, due to the inherent  uncertainty and judgment in forecasting and discounting future  cash flows. Accordingly, impairment assessment of property, plant and  equipment in the CGU is identified as a key audit matter. In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the following  audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient  appropriate audit evidence: 1.   Tested the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of the Holding company’s key controls over  impairment analysis of CGU. 2.   Tested budgeting procedures upon which the cash flow  forecasts were based. We also compared the actual past  performances with the budgeted figures. 3.   Involved valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the  key assumptions and methodology used by the Holding  company, in particular those relating to the forecast of the  revenue growth, profit margins, terminal growth rate and  discount rate. The valuation specialists also compared the  assumptions to externally derived data in relation to key  inputs such as projected economic growth, competition,  cost of inflation and discount rates. 4.   Assessed the sensitivity of the outcome of impairment  assessment to changes in key assumptions. 5.   Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in accordance  with the applicable accounting standards. Impairment of Property, plant and equipment of Agro chemicals segment (identified as cash generating  unit (‘CGU’) See Note 5 to consolidated financial statements Other Information The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the other information. The other information  comprises the information included in the Holding Company's  Annual report, but does not include the financial statements  and auditor’s report thereon. The Holding Company's Annual  report is expected to be made available to us after the date of  this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not  cover the other information and we will not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated. When we read the Holding Company's Annual report, if we  conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are  required to communicate the matter to those charged with  governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under  the relevant laws and regulations. Management's and Board of Directors'  Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial  Statements The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these  consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements  of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state  of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive  income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and  consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the  accounting principles generally accepted in India, including  the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under  Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and  Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group  are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for  safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing  and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection  and application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    268 

and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate  internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for  ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the  consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view  and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation  of the consolidated financial statements by the Management  and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the  respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies  included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability  of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board  of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in  the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting  process of each company. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they  could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated  financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also: 	   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from  error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. 	   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the company has adequate internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements in  place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 	   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by the Management and  Board of Directors. 	   Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis  of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial  statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw  attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up  to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue  as a going concern. 	   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the consolidated financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 	   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding  the financial statements of such entities or business  activities within the Group to express an opinion on the  consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for  the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of  the financial statements of such entities included in the  consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent auditors. For the other entities included in  the consolidated financial statements, which have been  audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain  responsible for the direction, supervision and performance  of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely  responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in  this regard are further described in paragraph (a) of the  section titled “Other Matter” in this audit report. We communicate with those charged with governance of the  Holding Company regarding, among other matters, the planned  scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  269 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we  identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement  that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements  regarding independence, and to communicate with them  all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be  thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,  related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter  should not be communicated in our report because the adverse  consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to  outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Other Matter a.   We did not audit the financial statements of 11  subsidiaries/ step down subsidiaries, whose financial  statements reflects total assets (before consolidation  adjustments) of INR 9,152 million as at 31 March 2025,  total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of INR  4,669 million and net cash inflows (before consolidation  adjustments) amounting to INR 440 million for the year  ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated  financial statements. These financial statements have  been audited by other auditors whose reports have been  furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on the  consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to  the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these  subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-section (3)  of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the  aforesaid subsidiaries is based solely on the reports of the  other auditors.   These subsidiaries/step down subsidiaries are located  outside India whose financial statements and other financial  information have been prepared in accordance with  accounting principles generally accepted in their respective  countries and which have been audited by other auditors  under generally accepted auditing standards applicable  in their respective countries. The Holding Company’s  management has converted the financial statements of  such subsidiaries/ step down subsidiaries located outside  India from accounting principles generally accepted in their  respective countries to accounting principles generally  accepted in India. We have audited these conversion  adjustments made by the Holding Company’s management.  Our opinion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs  of such subsidiaries/ step down subsidiaries located  outside India is based on the reports of other auditors and  the conversion adjustments prepared by the management  of the Holding Company and audited by us.   Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and  our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements  below, is not modified in respect of the above matters with  respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports  of the other auditors. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory  Requirements 1.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on  the consolidated financial statements of NATCO  Pharma Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025 Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause (i)  of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act (Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) Opinion In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements of NATCO Pharma Limited (hereinafter referred to  as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 31  March 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company  , as of that date. In our opinion, the Holding Company, has, in all material  respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements and such internal financial controls were  operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria  established by the Holding Company considering the essential  components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial  Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (the “Guidance Note”). Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls The Holding Company's Management and the Board of  Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements criteria  established by the Holding Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note.  These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to  the Holding Company's policies, the safeguarding of its  assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors,  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,  and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as  required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements based  on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed  under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to  an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements were established and maintained and if such  controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements and their operating  effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing  and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal  control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

A company's internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls  with Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements to future  periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of  compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 275 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) 1.   Reporting entity information   NATCO Pharma Limited  (“the Company” or “the Parent”)  is a public limited company domiciled in India and  incorporated in India with its registered office situated at  NATCO House, Road No. 2, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad –  500034. The Company has been incorporated under the  provisions of Companies Act, 1956 and its equity shares  are listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE  Limited (BSE) in India.   These consolidated financial statements comprise the  Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the  Group”) for the year ended 31 March 2025 is engaged  in the business of pharmaceuticals and agricultural  chemicals which comprises research and development,  manufacturing and selling of bulk drugs, finished dosage  formulations. The Group has manufacturing facilities in  India which caters to both domestic and international  markets including regulated markets like United States of  America and Europe. 2.   Basis of preparation A.   Statement of Compliance   These consolidated financial statements of the Group  have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) as per the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, notified under Section  133 of Companies Act, 2013, (the 'Act') and other relevant  provisions of the Act under the historical cost convention  on an accrual basis and going concern except for certain  financial instruments which are measured at fair values,  notified under the Act and Rules prescribed thereunder.   The consolidated financial statements for the year ended  31 March 2025 were authorized and approved for issue by  the Company’s Board of Directors on 28 May 2025.   Details of Group’s accounting policies are  included in Note 3. B.   Functional and presentation currency   These consolidated financial statements are presented in  Indian Rupee (‘INR’ or ‘₹’) which is also the Company’s  functional currency. All amounts have been rounded- off to the nearest millions, unless otherwise indicated.  Transactions and balances with values below the rounding  off norm adapted by the Group have been reflected as ‘0’  in relevant notes in the consolidated financial statements. C.   Current and non-current classification   Based on the time involved between acquisition of assets  for processing and their realisation of cash and cash  equivalents, the Group has identified twelve months as it  operating cycle for determining current and non-current  classification of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. D.   Operating cycle   The Group has ascertained its operating cycle as 12  months that is the time between the acquisition of  assets for processing and their realisation in cash or  cash equivalents. E.   Basis of Measurement   These consolidated financial statements have been  prepared on the historical cost basis except for the  following items which are measured an alternative basis  each reporting date: Items Measurement basis Certain financial  assets and liabilities Fair value Net defined benefit  asset/ (liability) Fair value of plan assets less  present value of defined benefit  obligations (Refer Note 19) Leases Lease liability is measured at the  present value of the remaining  lease payments, discounted using  the lessee’s incremental borrowing  rate at the date of initial application. Right-to-use asset has been  measured as an amount equal to  the lease liability, adjusted by the  amount of any prepaid or accrued  lease payments relating to that lease  recognised in the balance sheet  immediately before the date of initial  application. Practical expedient on  transition to exclude initial direct  costs from ROU asset measurement  is considered. (Refer Note 40) F.   Use of estimates and judgements   In preparing these consolidated financial statements,  Management has made judgements, estimates and  assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies  and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and  expenses. Actual results may differ from the estimates. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    282 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised prospectively.   Key accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions in  preparation of these consolidated financial statements are  given in Note 4. G.   Measurement of fair values   A number of the Group’s accounting policies and  disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for  both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.   The Group has an established control framework with  respect to the measurement of fair values. The finance  team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs  and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such  as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure  fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence  obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion  that these valuations meet the requirements of the  Accounting Standards, including the level in the fair value  hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.   Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair  value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the  valuation techniques as follows:   -   Level 1:  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets  for identical assets or liabilities.   -   Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included  in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or  liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e.  derived from prices).   -   Level 3:  inputs for the asset or liability that  are not based on observable market data  (unobservable inputs).   When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the  Group uses observable market data as far as possible. If  the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a  liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy,  then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety  in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest  level input that is significant to the entire measurement.   The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair  value hierarchy at the end of reporting period during which  the change has occurred. 3.   Material accounting policies a.   Basis of consolidation   i.   Business combinations     The Group accounts for business combinations  using the acquisition method when the acquired  set of activities and assets meets the definition of a  business and control is transferred to the Group. In  determining whether a particular set of activities and  assets is a business, the Group assesses whether  the set of assets and activities acquired includes,  at a minimum, an input and substantive process  and whether the acquired set has the ability to  produce outputs.     The consideration transferred in the acquisition  is generally measured at fair value as at the date  the control is acquired (acquisition date), as are  the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill  that arises is tested annually for impairment (see  3(c)). Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised  in the Other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) and  accumulated in equity as capital reserve if there  exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for  classifying the business combination as a bargain  purchase. If there does not exist clear evidence of  the underlying reasons for classifying the business  combination as a bargain purchase, then gain on  a bargain purchase is recognised directly in equity  as capital reserve. Transaction costs/ acquisition  related costs are expensed as incurred and services  are received, except if related to the issue of debt or  equity securities.     The consideration transferred does not include  amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing  relationships with the acquiree. Such amounts  are generally recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.     Any contingent consideration is measured at fair  value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay  contingent consideration that meets the definition of  a financial instrument is classified as equity, then  it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted  for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent  consideration is remeasured at fair value at each  reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair  value of the contingent consideration are recognised  in the statement of profit and loss. 283 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   ii.   Subsidiaries     Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has  control. The Group controls an entity when the Group  is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from  its involvement with the entity and has the ability  to affect those returns through its power to direct  the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are  fully consolidated from the date on which control is  transferred to the Group. The financial statements  of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated  financial statement from the date on which control  commences until the date on which control ceases.     Consolidation procedure followed is as under:     Items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses  and cash flows of the parent with those of its  subsidiaries are combined like to like basis. For this  purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are  based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities  recognized in the consolidated financial statements  at the acquisition date.   iii.   Non-controlling interests (NCI)     NCI are measured initially at their proportionate  share of the acquiree’s net identifiable asset at the  date of acquisition. Changes in the Group’s equity  interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of  control are accounted for as equity transactions.     Non-controlling interest is presented separately  from the liabilities or assets and the equity of the  shareholders in the consolidated Balance Sheet.  Non-controlling interest in the profit or loss of the  Group is separately presented.

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   v.   Change in ownership interests     The Group treats transactions with non-controlling  interests that do not result in a loss of control as  transactions with equity owners of the Group. A  change in ownership interest results in an adjustment  between the carrying amounts of the controlling  and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative  interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between  the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling  interests and any consideration paid or received is  recognised within equity.   vi.   Translation elimination     The Group combines the separate financial  statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by  line adding together like items of assets, liabilities,  contingent liabilities, equity, income and expenses.  Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised  gains on transactions between group companies  are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated  in the same way as unrealised gains unless the  transaction provide (except for foreign currency  translation gain or losses) evidence of an impairment  of the transferred asset.     The consolidated financial statements have  been prepared using uniform accounting policies  for like transactions and other events in similar  circumstances. The accounting policies adopted in  the preparation of consolidated financial statements  are consistent with those of previous year. The  financial statements of each of the subsidiaries used  for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to  same reporting date as that of the Company, i.e.,  year ended on 31 March 2025.   vii.   Loss of control     When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it  derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary,  and any related NCI and other components of equity.  Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or  loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is  measured at fair value when control is lost. b.   Property, plant and equipment (PPE)   Recognition and initial measurement   The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall  be recognised as an asset if, and only if it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.   Items of property, plant and equipment (including capital- work-in progress) are measured at cost (which includes  capitalised borrowing costs, if any) less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.  Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes  its purchase price, duties, taxes (non-deductible), after  deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly  attributable cost of bringing the item to its working  condition for its intended use and estimated costs of  dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site  on which it is located. Freehold land is not depreciated.   The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and  equipment comprises the cost of materials, direct labour  and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the item  to its intended working condition for its intended use and  estimated costs of dismantling, removing and restoring  the site on which it is located, wherever applicable.   If significant parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, then they are  accounted for as separate items (major components) of  property, plant and equipment.   Transition to Ind AS   The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 April 2016,  the Group’s date of transition to Ind AS was determined  with reference to its carrying value recognized as per  the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of  transition to Ind AS   Subsequent expenditure   Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable  that the future economic benefits associated with the  expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item  can be measured reliably.   Depreciation   Depreciation is calculated on cost of items of property,  plant and equipment less their estimated residual value  using straight line method over the useful lives of assets  estimated by the Group. Depreciation rates followed by  the Group coincides with rates prescribed in Schedule  II to the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation amount  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  Depreciation for assets purchased / sold during the period  is proportionately charged. i.e., from/(up to) the date on  which the asset is use/(disposed-off). 285 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and  equipment as follows: Assets Management’s  Estimated  useful life   (in years) Useful life as  per Schedule II   (in years) Buildings 3 to 60 3 to 60 Plant and machinery 5 to 20 5 to 20 Computers 3 to 6 3 to 6 Vehicles 8 to 10 8 to 10 Office equipment 5 5 Furniture and fixtures 10 10   Freehold land is not depreciated.   The residual values, useful lives and methods of  depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed  at each reporting date and adjusted, if appropriate.   De-recognition   An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant  part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected from its  use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition  of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset)  is included in the Statement of profit and loss, when the  asset is derecognised.   Capital work-in-progress   Capital work-in-progress includes cost of property, plant  and equipment under installation / under development as  at the balance sheet date. c.   Goodwill and Other Intangible assets   Recognition and initial measurement   Goodwill   Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries  (See Note 3(a(i)) is measured at cost less accumulated  impairment losses.   Other Intangible assets   Intangible assets (software) acquired separately are  measured on initial recognition at their cost. The cost  comprises purchase price, borrowing cost if capitalisation  criteria are met and cost directly attributable cost of  bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended  use. Any trade discount and rebates are deducted in  arriving at the purchase price.   Following initial recognition, other intangible assets are  measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any  accumulated impairment losses.   Transition to Ind AS   The cost of intangible assets at 1 April 2016, the Group’s  date of transition to Ind AS was determined with reference  to its carrying value recognized as per the previous GAAP  (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS   Amortisation   The Group amortises intangible assets with a finite  useful life using the straight-line method over the  following useful lives: Assets Useful life   (in years) Commercial product portfolio 10 to 15 Distributor relationships 10 to 15 Pipeline product portfolio 10 to 15 Abbreviated new drug applications 10 to 15 Computer Software 1 to 6   Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values  are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted  if appropriate.   Subsequent expenditure   Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it  increases the future economic benefits embodied in  the specific asset to which it relates and the cost can  be measured reliably. All other expenditure, including  expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands,  is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. d.   Foreign currencies   Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded  by the Group at its functional currency spot rates at the  date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currency are translated at the  functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting  date. Exchange differences that arise on settlement of  monetary items or on reporting at each balance sheet  date are recognised as income or expenses in the period  in which they arise. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    286 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) translated into the functional currency at the exchange  rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary  assets and liabilities which are carried at historical cost  denominated in a foreign currency are reported using the  exchange rates at the date of transaction. Foreign currency  exchange differences are generally recognised in profit  or loss, except foreign currency exchange differences  arising from the translation of the following items which  are recognised in other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) -   -   an investment in equity securities designated as  at fair value through other comprehensive income  (except on impairment, in which case foreign  currency differences that have been recognised in  OCI are reclassified to profit or loss).   Foreign Operations   The assets and liabilities of foreign operations (subsidiaries,  none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary  economy) that have a functional currency different from the  presentation currency are translated into the presentation  currency as follows:   1.   assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate  at the reporting date,   2.   income and expenses items are translated at average  exchange rates for respective periods; and   3.   Foreign currency differences are recognised in  OCI and accumulated in the equity (as exchange  differences on translating the financial statements  of a foreign operation), except to the extent that the  exchange differences are allocated to NCI.   When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or  partially such that control is lost, the cumulative amount  of exchange differences related to that foreign operation  recognised in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as part  of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes off  part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then  the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is re- allocated to NCI. When the Group disposes off only a part  of its interest in an associate while retaining significant  influence, the relevant proportion of the cumulative  amount is reclassified to Statement of Profit or Loss.   Foreign currency translation reserve   The exchange differences arising from the translation of  financial statements of foreign operations with functional  currency other than Indian Rupee is recognised in other  comprehensive income and is presented within equity in  the foreign currency translation reserve. e.   Revenue from contracts with customers   The Group derives revenues primarily from sale of finished  dosage formulations, active pharmaceutical ingredients  (APIs) and agricultural chemicals, including technically  complex molecules.   The Group generates revenue from its ordinary activities  i.e. from sale of goods and services. A contract in this  context shall fulfil all of the following conditions:   -   Both the parties to the contract agree on  the contract terms   -   Performance obligation of each of the parties  is identifiable and there exists a commitment to  perform their respective obligations; and   -   The commercial substance or the purchase  consideration is measurable and the  collectability is probable.   Disaggregation of revenue   The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with  customers by the nature of sale i.e. manufactured  and traded goods of pharmaceutical or agro chemical  products and sale of service and geography. The Group  believes that this disaggregation best depicts how  the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of Group’s  revenues and cashflows are affected by industry, market  and other economic factors.   Contract balances   The Group classifies the right to consideration in exchange  for sales of goods as trade receivables and advance  consideration as contract liability against payment.   The specific recognition criteria described below must  also be met before revenue is recognised:   Sale of goods:   Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when a promise  in a customer contract (performance obligation) has  been satisfied by transferring control over the promised  goods to the customer. Control is usually transferred  upon shipment/ delivery to/ upon receipt of goods by the  customer, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance  terms agreed with the customers. The amount of revenue  to be recognised is based on the consideration expected  287 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) to be received in exchange for goods, excluding trade  discounts, volume discounts, sales returns, chargeback,  medicaid payments, rebates, shelf stock adjustments,  where applicable and any taxes or duties collected on  behalf of the government which are levied on sales such  as goods and services tax, etc., where applicable.   The Group from time to time enters into marketing  arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of  its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements,  the Group sells its products to the business partners at a  non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the  arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which  is over and above the base purchase price. The profit  share is typically dependent on the business partner’s  ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any  reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms  of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require  the business partner to provide confirmation of units sold  and net sales or net profit computations for the products  covered under the arrangement.   Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price  is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of  products to the business partners. An additional amount  representing the profit share component is recognised as  revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a  significant reversal will not occur.   At the end of each reporting period, the Group updates  the estimated transaction price (including updating  its assessment of whether an estimate of variable  consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully  the circumstances present at the end of the reporting  period and the changes in circumstances during the  reporting period.   Sale of services:   Revenue from sale of services, includes in certain  instances, certain performance obligations and based  on evaluation of whether or not these obligations are in  consequential, revenue is recognised in accordance with  the terms of the contracts with the customers when the  related performance obligation is completed at point  in time or spread over a period of time, as applicable.  These arrangements typically consist of an initial upfront  payment on inception of the agreement and subsequent  payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in  accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement.  Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving  certain milestones are recognised as revenues either on  achievement of such milestones or over the performance  period depending on the terms of the contract.   The Group does not expect to have any contracts where  the period between the transfer of the promised goods or  services to the customer and payment by the customer  exceeds one year. As a consequence, it does not require  to adjust any of the transaction prices for the time  value of money. f.   Borrowing costs   Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including  exchange differences relating to foreign currency  borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an  adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection  with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly  attributable to the acquisition or construction of those  property, plant and equipment which necessarily takes a  substantial period of time to get ready for their intended  use are capitalised. All other borrowing costs are expensed  in the period in which they are incurred in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. g.   Government grants   Government grants are recognised where there is  reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and  all attached conditions will be complied with. When the  grant relates to revenue, it is recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods  to which they relate. When the grant relates to an asset,  it is presented as a reduction to the carrying value of  the related asset.   Export benefits available under prevalent schemes are  accrued in the year in which the goods are exported  and no significant uncertainty exist regarding its  ultimate collection. h.   Leases   At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a  contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains,  a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use  of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration.   i.   Leases as a lessee     The Group applies a single recognition and  measurement approach for all leases, except for  short-term leases and lease of low-value assets.  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    288 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease  payments and right-of-use assets representing the  right to use the underlying assets.     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using the straight-line method from the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of the  useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the  lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of  the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the  lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects  that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In  that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated  over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is  determined on the same basis as those of property  and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset  is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,  and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the  lease liability. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised  in the Statement of profit and loss.     The Group measures the lease liability at the  present value of the lease payments that are not  paid at the commencement date of the lease.  The lease payments are discounted using the  interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be  readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily  determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing  rate. The Group uses its incremental borrowing  rate as the discount rate. The Group determines  its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest  rates from various external financing sources and  makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of  the lease and type of the asset leased. For leases  with reasonably similar characteristics, the Group,  on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the  incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or  the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio.     The lease payments include     -   fixed payments, including in  substance fixed payment;     -   variable lease payments that depend on an  index or a rate, initially measured using the  index or rate as at the commencement date;     -   amount expected to be payable under a  residual value guarantees,     -   exercise price of a purchase option where the  Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option and payments of penalties for terminating  the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee  exercising an option to terminate the lease.     The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by  increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on  the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to  reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring  the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or  lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance  fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the  amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due  to modification as an adjustment to the right-of use  asset and Statement of profit and loss depending  upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero  and there is a further reduction in the measurement  of the lease liability, the Group recognises any  remaining amount of the re-measurement in  Statement of profit or loss.     It is remeasured when there is a change in future  lease payments arising from a change in an index  or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate  of the amount expected to be payable under a  residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its  assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase,  extension or termination option or if there is a revised  in-substance fixed lease payment.     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way,  a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero.     The Group presents right-of-use assets in ‘property,  plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities separately  in the Balance sheet within ‘financial liabilities’.     Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets     The Group has elected not to apply the requirements  of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all  assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less  and leases for which the underlying asset is of low  value. The lease payments associated with these  leases are recognized as an expense on a straight- line basis over the lease term. 289 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   ii.   Leases as lessor     When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at  lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease  or an operating lease.     To classify each lease, the Group makes an  overall assessment of whether the lease transfers  substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental  to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the  case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it  is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the  Group considers certain indicators such as whether  the lease is for the major part of the economic  life of the asset.     When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts  for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease  separately. It assesses the lease classification of a  sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset  arising from the head lease, not with reference to  the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term  lease to which the Group applies the exemption  described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as  an operating lease.     The Group recognises lease payments received  under operating leases as income on straight-line  basis over the lease term as part of ‘other income’. i.   Impairment of non-financial assets (Intangible  assets and property, plant and equipment)   At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying  amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories  and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any  indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then  the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Intangible  assets with indefinite useful life are tested annually for  impairment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.   For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable  amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell  and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset  basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that  are largely independent of those from other assets. In  such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the  cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. If such  assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment  to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss is  measured by the amount by which the carrying value of  the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of  the asset. Value in use is based on the estimated future  cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  of the time value of money and the risks specific to the  asset or cash generating unit.   An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not  subsequently reversed. In respect of other assets for which  impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, the  Group reviews at each reporting date whether there is any  indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.  An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit  and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates  used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying  amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable  amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the  carrying amount that would have been determined (net  of any accumulated amortisation or depreciation) had no  impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. j.   Financial instruments   i.   Initial recognition and measurement     Trade receivables and debt securities issued are  initially recognised when they are originated. All other  assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised  when the Group becomes a party to the contractual  provisions of the instrument. At the time of initial  recognition, these financial assets (unless it is a trade  receivable without a significant financing component)  or financial liabilities are measured at fair value. A trade  receivable without a significant financing component  is initially measured at the transaction price.     Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the  acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial  liabilities, that are not at fair value through profit or  loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.   ii.   Classification and subsequent measurement    Financial  assets     On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified  as measured at:    -   amortised  cost;     -   Fair value through other comprehensive  income– debt investment or equity  investment (‘FVOCI’); or NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    290 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)     -   Fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’).     The Group classifies financial assets as  subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value  through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or  fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) on the  basis of following: 	   the entity’s business model for managing the  financial assets and 	   the contractual cash flow characteristics of the  financial asset.     Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to  their initial recognition unless the Group changes  its business model for managing financial assets,  in which case all affected financial assets are  reclassified on the first day of the first reporting  period following the change in the business model.    Amortised  Cost:     A financial asset shall be classified and measured at  amortised cost if both of the following conditions are  met is not designated as FVTPL: 	   the financial asset is held within a business  model whose objective is to hold financial assets  in order to collect contractual cash flows; and 	   the contractual terms of the financial asset give  rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding. 	   On initial recognition of an equity investment  that is not held for trading, the Group may  irrevocably elect to present subsequent  changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI.  This election is made on an investment-by- investment basis.     Fair Value through OCI:     A financial asset shall be classified and measured  at fair value through other comprehensive income if  both of the following conditions are met and is not  designated as FVTPL: 	   the financial asset is held within a business  model whose objective is achieved by both  collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets; and 	   the contractual terms of the financial asset give  rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding. 	   On initial recognition of an equity investment  that is not held for trading, the Group may  irrevocably elect to present subsequent  changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI.  This election is made on an investment-by- investment basis.     Fair Value through Profit or Loss:     A financial asset shall be classified and measured at  fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured  at amortised cost or at fair value through other  comprehensive income.     All recognised financial assets are subsequently  measured in their entirety at either amortised cost  or fair value, depending on the classification of the  financial assets.     Classification of investments:     a.   Debt instruments at amortised cost -  A ‘debt  instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost  if both the following conditions are met:       The asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for collecting  contractual cash flows, and Contractual  terms of the asset give rise on specified dates  to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal  amount outstanding.       After initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.  Interest income, foreign exchange gains and  losses and impairment are recognised in profit  or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is  recognised in profit or loss.    b.   Equity investments -  All equity investments in  scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value.  Equity instruments which are held for trading  are classified at fair value through profit and  loss (FVTPL). For all other equity instruments,  the Group decides to classify the same either  as at fair value through other comprehensive  291 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit and  loss (FVTPL). The Group makes such election  on an instrument by instrument basis. The  classification is made on initial recognition and  is irrevocable.       These assets are subsequently measured at  fair value. Dividends are recognised as income  in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly  represents a recovery of part of the cost of  the investment. Other net gains and losses are  recognised in OCI and are not reclassified to  profit or loss.     c.   Mutual funds -  All mutual funds in scope of  Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value through  profit and loss (FVTPL). Net gains and losses,  including any interest or dividend income, are  recognised in profit or loss.       Interest income and expense and dividend  income:       For all financial instruments measured at  amortised cost, interest income is recorded  using the effective interest rate (EIR).  Interest income is included in other income  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The  ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly  discounts estimated future cash payments  or receipts through the expected life of the  financial instrument to:       -   the gross carrying amount of the  financial asset; or       -   the amortised cost of the financial liability       In calculating interest income and expense, the  effective interest rate is applied to the gross  carrying amount of the asset (when the asset  is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost  of the liability. However, for financial assets that  have become credit-impaired subsequent to  initial recognition, interest income is calculated  by applying the effective interest rate to  the amortised cost of the financial asset. If  the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then  the calculation of interest income reverts to  the gross basis.       Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss  on the date when the Group’s right to receive  the payment is established, which is generally  when shareholders approve the dividend.    Financial  liabilities     Financial liabilities are classified as measured  at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability  is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held- for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as  such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at  FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains  and losses, including any interest expense, are  recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method. Interest expense and  foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised  in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is  also recognised in statement of profit or loss.   iii.   De-recognition    Financial  assets     The Group derecognises a financial asset when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial  asset expire, or it transfers the right to receive the  contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either  substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership  of the financial assets are transferred or in which the  Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all  of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not  retain control of the financial asset.     If the Group enters into transactions whereby it  transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but  retains either all or substantially all of the risks and  rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred  assets are not derecognised.    Financial  liabilities     The Group derecognises a financial liability when  its contractual obligations are discharged or  cancelled, or expire.     The Group also derecognises a financial liability  when its terms are modified and the cash flows under  the modified terms are substantially different. In this  case, a new financial liability based on the modified  terms is recognised at fair value. The difference  between the carrying amount of the financial liability  extinguished and a new financial liability with  modified terms is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    292 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   iv.   Offsetting     Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset  and the net amount presented in the balance sheet  when, and only when, the Group currently has a  legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it  intends either to settle them on a net basis or realise  the asset and settle the liabilities simultaneously.   v.   Financial guarantee contracts     Financial guarantee contracts are those contracts  that require a payment to be made to reimburse the  holder for a loss it incurs because the specified party  fails to make a payment when due in accordance with  the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee  contracts are recognised initially as a liability at  fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.  Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of  the amount of expected loss allowance determined  as per impairment requirements of Ind-AS 109 and  the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation. k.   Impairment of financial assets   The Group recognises loss allowances for ECLs on:   •   financial assets measured at amortised cost;   •   debt investments measured at FVOCI;   At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether  financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit –  impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental  impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial  asset have occurred.   Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes  the following observable data:   -   Significant financial difficulty of the borrower   -   a breach of contract;   -   it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy  or other financial reorganisation; or   -   the disappearance of an active market for a security  because of financial difficulties   The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal  to lifetime expected credit losses.   Loss allowances for trade receivables, loans, contract  assets are always measured at an amount equal to  lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit  losses are the expected credit losses that result from  all possible default events over the expected life of a  financial instrument.   12-month expected credit losses are the portion of  expected credit losses that result from default events that  are possible within 12 months after the reporting date (or a  shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less  than 12 months).   In all cases, the maximum period considered when  estimating expected credit losses is the maximum  contractual period over which the Group is exposed  to credit risk.   When determining whether the credit risk of a financial  asset has increased significantly since initial recognition  and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers  reasonable and supportable information that is relevant  and available without undue cost or effort. This includes  both quantitative and qualitative information and  analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience  and informed credit assessment, that includes forward- looking information.   Measurement of ECLs   ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses.  Credit losses are measured as the present value of all  cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows  due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the  cash flows that the Group expects to receive).   Write-off   The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written  off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no  realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case  when the Group determines that the debtors does not have  assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient  cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write off.  However, financial assets that are written off could still be  subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with  the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. l.   Inventories   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable  value. The cost of inventories is determined on a moving  weighted average basis, and includes cost for acquiring  the inventories, production or conversion costs and other  costs incurred in bringing them to their present location  293 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) and condition. In the case of raw materials and stock-in- trade, cost comprises of cost of purchase. In the case  of finished goods and work in progress, cost includes  an appropriate share of production overheads based on  normal operating capacity.   Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in  the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs  of completion and the estimated costs necessary  to make the sale.   The net realisable value of work-in-progress is determined  with reference to the selling prices of related finished  goods. Raw materials, components and other supplies  held for use in the production of finished products are not  written down below cost except in cases when a decline  in the price of materials indicates that the cost of the  finished products shall exceed the net realisable value.  The comparison of cost and net realisable value is made  on an item-by-Item basis.   The provision for inventory obsolescence is assessed  regularly based on estimated usage and shelf  life of products. m.   Income taxes   Income tax comprises current an d deferred tax. It is  recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it  relates to an item recognised directly in equity or in other  comprehensive income. The Group has determined that  interest and penalties related to income taxes, including  uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition  of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them  under Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets.   i.   Current tax     Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or  receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year  and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable  in respect of previous years. The amount of current  tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount  expected to be paid or received after considering  the uncertainty, if any related to income taxes. It is  measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or  substantively enacted by the reporting date.     Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there  is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised  amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and  settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.   ii.   Deferred tax     Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary  differences between the carrying amounts of assets  and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the  corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes.     Deferred tax is not recognised for:     -   Temporary differences arising on the initial  recognition of assets or liabilities in a  transaction that 	   is not a business combination and 	   at the time of transaction (i)affects neither  accounting nor taxable profit or loss and  (ii) does not give rise to equal taxable and  deductible temporary differences     Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax  losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary  differences to the extent that it is probable that future  taxable profits will be available against which they  can be used. Future taxable profits are determined  based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary  differences. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each  reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it  is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will  be realised; such reductions are reversed when the  probability of future taxable profits improves.     Deferred tax assets recognised or unrecognised are  reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised  / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer  probable respectively that the related tax benefit  will be realised.     Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are  expected to apply to the period when the asset is  realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws  that have been enacted or substantively enacted by  the reporting date.     The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax  consequences that would follow from the manner in  which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to  recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets  and liabilities.     The Group offsets, the current tax assets and  liabilities (on a year on year basis) and deferred  tax assets and liabilities, where it has a legally  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    294 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) enforceable right and where it intends to settle such  assets and liabilities on a net basis. Deferred tax  relating to items recognised outside profit or loss  is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other  comprehensive income or in equity). n.   Cash and cash equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand,  demand deposits with banks, other short-term highly  liquid investments with original maturities of three months  or less that are readily convertible into known amounts  of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value. o.   Post-employment, long-term and short-term  employee benefits   Defined contribution plan   A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit  under which an entity pays a specific contribution to a  separate entity and has no obligation to pay any further  amounts. The Group’s contribution to provident fund and  employee state insurance schemes is charged to the  Statement of profit and loss during the period in which  the employee renders the related service. The Group’s  contributions towards Provident Fund are deposited  with the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner under a  defined contribution plan. The Group has no obligation,  other than the contribution payable to these funds.   Defined benefit plan   The Group has gratuity as defined benefit plan where the  amount that an employee will receive on retirement is  defined by reference to the employee’s length of service  and final salary. The liability recognised in the balance  sheet for defined benefit plans is the present value of the  defined benefit obligation (DBO) at the reporting date net of  fair value of plan assets. Management estimates the DBO  annually with the assistance of independent actuaries, by  adopting the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains  and losses resulting from re-measurements of the liability  are included in other comprehensive income. The Group  determines the net interest expense (income) on the net  defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying  the discount rate determined by reference to market  yields at the end of the reporting period on government  bonds. Net interest expense and other expenses related  to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.   The Group has subscribed to a group gratuity scheme  of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Under the  said policy, the eligible employees are entitled for gratuity  upon their resignation, retirement or in the event of death  in lumpsum after deduction of necessary taxes upto a  maximum limit of ₹2 million. Liabilities in respect of the  Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation,  based upon which the Group makes contributions to  the Gratuity Fund.   Other long-term employee benefits   The Group also provides benefit of compensated absences  to its employees which are in the nature of long-term  benefit plan. Liability in respect of compensated absences  becoming due and expected to be availed more than one  year after the balance sheet date is estimated on the basis  of an actuarial valuation performed by an independent  actuary using the projected unit credit method as on  the reporting date. Actuarial gains and losses arising  from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial  assumptions are recorded in the Statement of profit or  loss in the year in which such gains or losses arise.   Short-term employee benefits   Short-term employee benefits comprise of employee  costs such as salaries, bonus etc. is recognised on the  basis of the amount paid or payable for the period during  which services are rendered by the employee. Short-term  employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted  basis and expensed as the related service is provided. A  liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid  under short-term basis if the Group has a present legal or  constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of  past service provided by the employee and the obligation  can be estimated reliably. p.   Share-based payments   Certain employees of the Group are entitled to  remuneration in the form of equity settled instruments, for  rendering services over a defined vesting period. Equity  instruments granted are measured by reference to the  fair value of the instrument at the date of grant using an  appropriate valuation model.   The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed  over the vesting period of the respective tranches of such  grants. The stock compensation expense is determined  based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that  will eventually vest using fair value in accordance with Ind  295 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) AS 102, Share based payment. The cost is recognised,  together with a corresponding increase in ‘Share options  outstanding account’ reserves in Equity, over the period  in which the performance and / or service conditions are  fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The dilutive effect  of outstanding options is reflected as additional share  dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share. q.   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent  assets   General   Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present  obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event  and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation  and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of  the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of  a provision to be reimbursed, the expense relating to a  provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss,  net of any reimbursement.   If the effect of the time value of money is material,  provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate  that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the  liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the  provision due to the passage of time is recognised as  a finance cost.   Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets   Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past  events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain  future events not wholly within the control of the entity or  a present obligation that arises from past events but is not  recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefits will be required  to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation  cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. The Group  does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its  existence in the consolidated financial statements.   Contingent asset is not recognised in consolidated  financial statements since this may result in the recognition  of income that may never be realised. However, when the  realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related  asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised.   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are  reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.   Onerous contracts   Provision for onerous contracts. i.e. contracts where the  expected unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations  under the contract exceed the economic benefits  expected to be received under it, are recognised when  it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle a present  obligation as a result of an obligating event based on a  reliable estimate of such obligation.   A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the  present value of the lower of the expected cost of  terminating the contract and the expected net cost of  continuing with the contract, which is determined based  on the incremental costs of fulfilling the obligation under  the contract and an allocation of other costs directly  related to fulfilling the contract. Before a provision is  established, the Group recognises any impairment loss  on the assets associated with that contract. r.   Earnings per share   Basic Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) is computed by dividing  the net profit attributable to the equity shareholders by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed  by dividing the net profit (considered in determination of  Basic EPS) after considering the effect of interest and  other financing costs or income (net of attributable taxes)  associated with the dilutive potential equity shares by the  weighted average number of equity shares considered for  deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been  issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity  shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  converted as of the beginning of the year, unless issued  at a later date. In computing diluted earnings per share,  only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that either  reduces earnings per share or increases loss per share are  included. The number of shares and potentially dilutive  equity shares are adjusted for bonus issue, bonus element  in a rights issue to existing shareholders, share split and  reverse share split (consolidation of shares). s.   Cash flow statement   Cash flows are reported using indirect method, whereby  net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects of  transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or  accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments and  items of income or expenses associated with investing or  NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    296 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) financing cash flows. The cash flows from regular revenue  generating (operating activities), investing and financing  activities of the Group are segregated. t.   Research and development   Expenditure on research activities are expensed as and  when incurred. Development expenses which meet  defined criteria for capitalisation are capitalized if its  ability to generate future economic benefits is reasonably  certain. All other development costs are expensed as and  when incurred. Capital expenditure incurred on research  and development is capitalized as property, plant and  equipment and depreciated in accordance with the  depreciation policy of the Group. u.   Events after reporting date   Where events occurring after the balance sheet date  provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of  the reporting period, the impact of such events is adjusted  within the consolidated financial statements. Otherwise,  events after the balance sheet date of material size or  nature are only disclosed. v.   Segment reporting   An operating segment is component of the Group that  engages in business activities from which it may earn  revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are  regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer to  make decisions for which discrete financial information is  available. Based on the management approach as defined  in Ind AS 108, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”)  evaluates the group’s performance and allocates resources  based on analysis of various performance indicators  by business segments and geographic segments. The  analysis of geographical segments is based on the areas in  which the customers of the Group are located. w.   Recent accounting pronouncements   Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new  standards or amendments to the existing standards  under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules  as issued from time to time. For the year ended March  31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance  Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 –Leases,  relating to sale and lease back transactions, applicable  to the Group w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Group has reviewed  the new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has  determined that it does not have any significant impact in  its financial statements. 4.   Use of Judgements and estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  the Ind AS requires judgements, estimates and assumptions  to be made that affect the reported amounts of assets  and liabilities on the date of the financial statements, the  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the  reporting period and the disclosures relating to contingent  liabilities as of the date of the financial statements.  Although these estimates are based on the management’s  best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty  about these assumptions and estimates could result in  outcomes different from the estimates. Difference between  actual results and estimates are recognised in the period  in which the results are known or materialise. Estimates  and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing  basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised  prospectively in the current and future periods.   Management considers the accounting estimates and  assumptions discussed below to be its critical accounting  estimates and, accordingly, provide an explanation  of each below. The discussion below should also be  read in conjunction with the Group’s disclosure of  material accounting policies which are provided in Note  3 to the consolidated financial statements, ‘Material  Accounting policies’.   Judgments:   Taxes on income:   Significant judgments are involved in determining the  provision for income taxes, including possibility of  utilisation of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit in  future. Refer Note 29.   Impairment of property, plant and equipment   Significant judgment is involved in determining the  estimated future cash flows from the cash-generating unit  to determine their value in use to assess whether there is  any impairment in their carrying amounts as reflected in  the consolidated financial statements. Refer Note 5.   Assumptions and estimate uncertainties:   Recognition of deferred tax assets – The extent to which  deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an  assessment of the probability of the Group’s future  taxable income against which the deferred tax assets  can be utilised. In addition, significant judgement is  required in assessing the impact of any legal or economic  limits. Refer Note 29. 297 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   Evaluation of indicators for impairment of intangible  assets:  The evaluation of applicability of indicators  of impairment of assets requires assessment of  several external and internal factors which could  result in deterioration of recoverable amount of the  assets. Refer Note 6.   Useful lives of property, plant and equipment/  intangible assets:  Management reviews its estimate  of the useful lives of depreciable/amortisable assets at  each reporting date, based on the expected utility of the  assets. Uncertainties in these estimates relate to technical  and economic obsolescence that may change the utility  of certain software, IT equipment and other plant and  equipment. Refer Note 5 and Note 6.   Impairment of Goodwill:  Management reviews the  impairment test of goodwill basis key assumptions  underlying recoverable amounts, including the  recoverability of the cash generating unit. Refer Note 5.   Defined benefit obligation (DBO):  Management’s  estimate of the DBO is based on a number of critical  underlying assumptions such as standard rates of  inflation, mortality, discount rate and anticipation of  future salary increases. Variation in these assumptions  may significantly impact the DBO amount and the annual  defined benefit expenses. Refer Note 19.   Fair value measurements:  Management applies  valuation techniques to determine the fair value of  financial instruments (where active market quotes are  not available) and non-financial assets. This involves  developing estimates and assumptions consistent with  how market participants would price the instrument.  Management uses the best information available.  Estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that  would be achieved in an arm’s length transaction at the  reporting date. Refer Note 31.   Provisions:  The Group exercises judgement in measuring  and recognising provisions and the exposures to  contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other  outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement,  mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well  as other contingent liabilities. Judgement is necessary  in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will  succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the  possible range of the financial settlement. Because of  the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual  losses may be different from the originally estimated  provision. Refer Note 19. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    298

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated) (vi)   As required by Ind AS 36, an assessment of impairment of assets has been carried out and based on such assessment and  necessary disclosures are given below:   The Group has identified its reportable segments Pharmaceuticals and Agro Chemicals as separate Cash generating units  ('CGUs') for the purpose of impairment testing. Basis the assessment of indicators of impairment, owing to the continous  losses in the Agro chemical segment and reduction in the forcasted revenue and free cashflows, the Company has performed  an assessment of possible impairment in the Property, plant and equipment of the Agro Chemicals segment.   The recoverable amount of this CGU was based on its value in use, determined by discounting the future cash flows to be  generated from the continuing use of the CGU.   The enterprise value is then compared with net book value of CGU to test for impairment. As at   31-03-2025 Value in use  2,398  Carrying value  2,898  Impairment loss recognised under depreciation and amortisation expense in statement of profit and loss  500    Carrying value is equal to the net assets of the Agro Chemical segment.   Weighted average cost of capital % (WACC) pre tax ('Discount rate') used for arriving at the value in use is 14.99%. 6.

(ii)   Impairment:   See accounting policy in note 3(i).   Impairment testing for cash generating unit ('CGU') containing goodwill -   For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group's operating division which represents the lowest  level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Group's  operating segment. The goodwill acquired through business combination has been allocated to "NATCO Pharma USA LLC"  (Formerly known as Dash Pharmaceuticals LLC) which is part of the pharma segment. The carrying amount of goodwill as at  31 March 2025 is ₹ 574 (31 March 2024: ₹ 560).   Following key assumptions were considered while performing goodwill valuation:   Annual growth rate for 5 years (Average): 32.00% (31-03-2024: 16.50%)   Terminal value growth rate: 2% (31-03-2024: 2%)   Discount rate: 13.17% (pre tax rate: 13.26%) (31-03-2024: 14.02% (pre tax: 14.09%)   The cash flow projections include specific estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter. The terminal growth  rate has been determined based on the management's estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate,  consistent with the assumptions that a market participant would make.   Discount rate = (We*Re)+(Wd*Rd)   Re = Risk free return + (Market premium x Beta for the Company) + additional risk premium   Rd = Cost of debt* (1-tax rate)   We,Wd = Average debt to capital ratio   The Group has performed sensitivity analysis around the base assumptions and has concluded that no reasonable change  in key assumptions would result in the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than the carrying value. Accordingly, no  impairment charges were recognised for FY 2024-2025. 301 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Under the said  policy, the eligible employees are entitled for gratuity upon their resignation, retirement or in the event of death in lumpsum  after deduction of necessary taxes up to a maximum limit of ₹ 2. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by  an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Holding Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. The defined benefit  plans expose the Holding Company to actuarial risk, interest rate risk and investment risk etc.   Interest Rate Risk:  The plan exposes the Holding Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result  in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability.   Liquidity Risk:  This is the risk that the Holding Company is not able to meet the short-term gratuity payouts. This may arise  due to non availability of enough cash/cash equivalent to meet the liabilities or holding of illiquid assets not being sold in  time. NATCO PHARMA LIMITED    314 

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   Investment Risk:  The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment.   The Gratuity plan is administered through Group Gratuity Scheme with Life Insurance Corporation of India ('LIC'). Every  employee who has completed five years or more of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days salary (last drawn salary)  for each completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months.   The Company has determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the gratuity plan, and in accordance with  statutory requirements (including minimum funding requirements) of the plan of the relevant jurisdiction, the present value of  refund or reduction in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the total fair value of the plan assets less the total  present value of obligations. As such, no decrease in the defind benefit asset is necessary at 31 March 2025 (31 March 2024:  no decrease in defined benefit asset). Project unit credit method has been used for valuation.

The excess of MAT tax over current tax  is eligible to be carried forward and set-off in the future against the current tax liabilities over a period of 15 years.   The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities year on year basis only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax  assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the  same tax authority.   Significant management judgement is required in determining provision for income-tax, deferred tax assets and liabilities and  recoverability of deferred tax assets. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of taxable income by each  jurisdiction in which the relevant entity operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recovered.

The above MAT credit expires at various dates ranging from Assesment year 2029 through 2039. (F)   The Group has established the comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents as required by the  transfer pricing legislation under Sections 92-92F of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Since the law requires existence of such  information and documentation to be contemporaneous in nature, the Group is in the process of updating the documentation  for the international transactions and specified domestic transactions entered into with associated enterprises during the  financial year and expects such records to be in existence latest by 31 October 2025 as required by law. The management  confirms its international transaction are at arms' length price so that aforesaid legislation will not have any impact on the  consolidated financial statements, particularly on the amount of tax expense and that of provision for taxation.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial  assets include loans, trade receivables, other financial assets, cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances that derive  directly from its operations. The Group also holds certain investments in other entities.   The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, trade receivables, loans, investment in quoted and unquoted  debentures and bonds, borrowings, trade payables, other financial assets and other financial liabilities approximate their  carrying amount largely due to the nature of these instruments. The Group's loans have been contracted at market rates of  interest. Accordingly, the carrying value of such loans approximate fair value. B.   Measurement of fair values   Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs   Level 1:  The fair value of the quoted investments are based on market price at the reporting date.   Level 3:  The Investments measured at fair value and falling under fair value hierarchy Level 3 are valued on the basis of  valuation reports provided by external valuers with the exception of certain investments, where the impact of fair valuation  of investment is considered as insignificant and hence carrying value and fair value is considered as same. The significant  unobservable inputs involved are primarily growth rate, discount rate and terminal growth rate. The relationship of significant  unobservable value and fair value is as follows:   the estimated fair value will increase/(decrease) if the expected growth rate and terminal rate increases/(decreases);   the estimated fair value will (decrease)/increase if the expected discount rate increases/(decreases)   Transfer between Level 1 and 2   There have been no transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 or vice versa in FY 2024-25 and no transfers in either direction in FY 2023-24.

Financial risk management The Board of Directors of the Group has overall responsibility for the establishment and deployment of risk management framework.  The Board of Directors have adopted a Risk Policy, which empowers the management to access and monitor the risk management  parameters along with action taken and the same is updated to Board of Directors. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks being faced by the Group, to set appropriate  risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly  to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and  procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles  and obligations. The Audit Committee of the Group oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies  and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risk faced by the Group. The  Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and adhoc reviews of risk  management controls and procedures, the result of which are reported to the Audit Committee.  A.   Market risk:   Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk comprises two types of risks: interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments affected by  market risk include borrowings, deposits, loans, trade receivables and trade payables.   i.   Interest rate risk     Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  in market interest rates. The Company's entire borrowings carried at amortised cost are variable rate instruments and  are subject to fluctuation because of a change in market interest rates. The Company considers the impact of fair value  interest rate risk on variable rate borrowings as not material.     The Group’s variable rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Below are the details of exposure to fixed rate and  variable rate instruments: Particulars As at   31-03-2025 As at   31-03-2024 Fixed rate instruments Financial assets  28,424   16,934  Variable rate instruments Financial liabilities (other than lease liability)  2,731   3,632  331 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements

Foreign currency risk:     Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes  in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is mismatch between the  currencies in which sales, purchase are denominated and the respective functional currencies of the Group companies.  The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities.     The Group's exposure to foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities expressed in ₹ are as follows:     Financial assets and financial liabilities: 31-03-2025 Trade  receivables* Other bank  balances Borrowings* Other financial  liabilities Trade    payables - USD  10,500   311   1,547   32   60  - EUR  52    -     32   34   8  - CAD  22    -      -     -    -    - CHF   -      -      -     -   0  - AUD  52    -      -     -    -    - SGD  48    -      -     -   23  31-03-2024 Trade  receivables* Other bank  balances Borrowings* Other financial  liabilities Trade    payables -   USD  8,564   283   968   19   93  -   EUR  78    -     43   4   5  -   CAD  55    -     5   -    -    -   CHF   -      -      -     1    -    -   AUD  77    -      -     -    -    -   GBP  5    -     5   -    -    -   SGD  28    -      -     -    -        * Includes bills discounted which are forming part of trade receivables and borrowings amounting to ₹ 1,579 (31-03-2024: ₹ 1,021).

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates,  remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases.     The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in various foreign currencies.

Credit risk   Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its  contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and loans given. Credit risk arises  from cash held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients, including outstanding accounts  receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets. The objective of  managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Group assesses the credit quality of the  counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.   Trade and other receivables:   The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics  of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on  credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring  the credit worthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business.   Impairment losses on financial assets and contract assets recognised in profit or loss were as follows.

Notes to consolidated Financial Statements (All amounts in ₹ millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)   Other financial assets:   Other financial assets primarily consists of cash and cash equivalents and deposits. Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents  and deposits with banks and financial institutions are generally low as the said deposits have been made with the banks  and financial institutions who have been assigned high credit rating by international and domestic credit rating agencies.  Investments in other entities are strategic investments in the normal course of business of the Group. Loans to related parties  are given for business purposes. The Group reassesss the recoverability of loans periodically. Interest recoveries from these  loans are regular and there is no interest receipt defaults. C.   Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities  that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as  possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions,  without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.   Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of  expected cash flows. The Group takes into account the liquidity of the market in which the entities operates. In addition, the  Group’s liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid  assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements  and maintaining debt financing plans.   The Group's principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from operations. The Group has no long-term borrowings  and believes that the working capital is sufficient for its current requirements. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.   Maturities of financial liabilities   The tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities  for all financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within  12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is insignificant.

The revenue from such major customer(s) during the year is ₹ 26,862 (31-03-2024: ₹18,283) and the outstanding  amount as at 31-03-2025 amounts to ₹ 7,308 (31-03-2024: ₹6,409). 37. Contingent liabilities and commitments (a)   Commitments  As at  31-03-2025 31-03-2024 Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account  and not provided for (including comitment towards purchase of property, plant  and equipment, net of advances amounting to ₹ 200 (31-03-2024: ₹231)  379   490  Pending export obligation under EPCG Scheme  15   11  Other commitment (refer Note - 1 below)  83   83    Note 1:   The Holding Company has an outstanding commitment of investment for an amount of ₹ 83 (31-03-2024: ₹ 83) in Cellogen  Therapeutics Pvt Ltd as at 31-03-2025. (b)   Contingent liabilities    (i)   Matters under appeals with tax authorities:  As at  31-03-2025 31-03-2024 Disputed Income tax liabilities  24   -  Disputed indirect tax liabilities  6   4      The Group is contesting the above demand including few land related claims and the management believes that its  position will likely be upheld in the appellate process and no expenses has been accrued in the consolidated financial  statements for the demand raised/ show cause notice received as the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have  a material adverse effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements. Pending resolution of the aforesaid respective  proceedings, it is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above.   (ii)   The Group is contesting certain process and product patent infringement cases filed against it by the innovators in the  ordinary course of business. A few of these cases pertain to products already launched by the Group in the market. These  cases are pending before different authorities / courts and most of the claims involve complex issues. The outcome from  these claims are uncertain due to a number of factors involved in legal trial such as stage of the proceedings and the  overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as  to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further  legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties  and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is difficult to  ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected  financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. Further, at present, the management  does not expect such liabilities to be significant.   (iii)   The Group has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has adequately provided for where provisions  are required and disclosed as contingent liabilities where applicable, in its consolidated financial statements. The group  does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position. 341 Corporate Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements
