Group Purpose Statement To enrich lives,    by building   dynamic and  responsible  businesses and  institutions, that  inspire trust. Mr. Aditya Vikram Birla 14 th  November 1943 to 1 st  October 1995 We live by his values. Integrity, commitment,  passion, seamlessness    and speed. 

Dear Shareholders, FY 2024-25 was a study in resilience and dynamism,  shaped by the push and pull of uncertainty and the  powerful force of adaptive leadership. For the Aditya Birla  Group, it was a year of unprecedented growth and renewal.  The Group has been an engine of big bets, moving with  conviction across multiple frontiers. “We witnessed, in vivid form, the  breadth, depth, and scale of our  businesses, reflected in the sheer  simultaneity of strategic moves.  New platforms were launched and  rapidly scaled in paints, in jewellery  retail, and in B2B E-commerce.  At the same time, we deepened  leadership in our core sectors like  cement, metals, fibre, chemicals, and  financial services.” Each move was consequential on its own. Together, they  reflect a rare dynamism. A kind of corporate choreography.  What enables it? A distinctive alchemy of capital strength,  institutional talent, brand equity, sectoral expertise, and  trust, carefully built over decades. It is this combination  that has allowed us to move swiftly and with clarity, even  amidst global uncertainty. Global Outlook: Making Sense  of an Uncertain World The global economy in 2024 proved unexpectedly steady,  growing at 3.3%, only a shade below the 3.5% posted a year  earlier, despite persistent noise and disruption. According  to the International Monetary Fund, this resilience  held firm against an unsettled backdrop of inflationary  pressures, geopolitical fault lines, and fragmenting trade  ties. The United States, driven by buoyant consumer and  government spending, led the developed world with GDP  growth of 2.8%. Yet this strength stood in contrast to more  subdued performances across Asia and Europe. China’s recovery, once a cornerstone of global momentum,  remained hesitant. Sluggish consumer demand and  ongoing stress in the property sector weighed heavily.  In parallel, investment levels across major economies  stagnated, productivity gains stalled, and public debt  remained a growing concern. Geopolitical tensions, now more durable than episodic,  compounded market uncertainty. A more fragmented  world economy, shaped by competing spheres of influence  and rising trade friction, added further complexity. Yet not all signals were dim. Inflation eased, dropping from  6.6% in 2023 to 5.7% in 2024, reflecting tighter monetary  policy and a marked softening of supply chain disruptions.  Central banks in advanced economies began pivoting  away from restrictive stances, making financial conditions  more supportive, though not without caution. Looking  ahead, global growth is expected to moderate to 2.8% in  2025 before edging up to 3.0% in 2026. Much of the drag is  expected from advanced economies, with their collective  growth projected to slow from 1.8% to 1.4%. Monetary easing and subsiding inflation offer some  tailwinds. Still, vulnerabilities persist. Geopolitical conflict,  high borrowing costs, and deteriorating trade dynamics  remain formidable obstacles. Inflation is projected to fall  further to 4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026, but service sector  inflation remains sticky, and trade disruptions could yet  spark fresh cost pressures. Merchandise trade, long the engine of global growth, faces  an uncertain future. New tariffs and retaliatory measures  risk pulling global trade volumes into contractionary  territory. Encouragingly, recent bilateral trade deals  suggest that diplomacy is not entirely off the table, even as  rhetoric hardens. India in FY 2024–25: Standing Strong  in a Fractured World India emerged as an outlier of stability and momentum in  a world adrift. With projected GDP growth of 6.4-6.5%, it  retained its crown as the fastest-growing major economy.  The final quarter surged to 7.4%, powered by construction,  manufacturing, and sustained government capital outlay. Policy credibility, macroeconomic resilience, and  diversified growth engines underpinned this performance.  Consumption rebounded and exports rose. Agriculture  benefited from favourable monsoons and strong foodgrain  output. Services, still India’s growth mainstay, grew by  7.2%, accounting for over half of gross value added. India’s export story was particularly telling. Merchandise  and services exports reached an all-time high of  US$824.9 billion, up 6.01% YoY, a feat few economies  could match amid global headwinds. Inflation, a lingering  concern globally, trended down decisively.  “I am pleased to share that  we achieved our highest - eve r  consolidated revenue of  I 1,48,478 crore, crossing US$17 billion.    We have nearly doubled our topline  over FY 2019-20 to FY 2024 - 25,  representing a robust 15%  CAGR, a testament to our enduring  commitment to  ‘ Force for Growth ’.”   Kumar Mangalam Birla Chairman Chairman’s Message Integrated Report      Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements      Consolidated Financial Statements 3 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 2 Grasim Industries Limited 

In Mumbai, 99.5% of eligible employees completed annual  health check-ups. Across the Group, businesses tailored  wellness initiatives to local contexts, ensuring impact  with empathy. Employee engagement levels remain among the highest in  the industry. Our internal survey, ABG Vibes 2025, reported  a 91% engagement score; 87% of employees indicated a  strong intent to build long-term careers within the Group.  These numbers not only exceed external benchmarks but  also speak to the emotional equity we have built over time. Our people philosophy extends beyond the workplace.  Through the A World of Opportunities Foundation,  203 scholarships were awarded to students from  underprivileged backgrounds. Over 33,000 employees  contributed  I 6.7 crore, reflecting a deep culture of giving.  Since inception, nearly 5,000 scholarships have been  granted, and more than 2,000 alumni are now gainfully  employed across India. Meanwhile, our Deep Volunteering  programme enabled 250 employees to contribute directly  to grassroots causes, with 16 selected for immersive  NGO engagements in remote areas -living, learning,  and giving back. The year culminated with  meaningful external recognition.  The Aditya Birla Group was named  a Top Employer 2025 in India by  the Top Employers Institute and  featured among Forbes World’s  Best Employers.  These accolades reaffirm our belief that our people  are the key to our continued success. And in  building a world of opportunities for our people,  we deepen our own purpose as a  Force for Good . The headline inflation rate eased to 4.6%, from 5.4% a  year earlier, helped by effective supply-side interventions,  softening input costs, and timely monetary policy  adjustments. The Reserve Bank of India moved from  tightening to a neutral stance in October 2024, then back  to accommodative in April 2025. The financial system stood firm. Balance sheets  strengthened and asset quality improved. Loan growth  remained in double digits. Yields softened across  government and corporate debt, reinforcing investor  confidence. India enters the new fiscal year with tailwinds  intact. GDP growth is projected at 6.5%, with risks  well - balanced. Consumption is expected to pick up  further. Public investment will likely remain a key growth  lever, while fiscal consolidation continues. Manufacturing momentum is expected to build,  supported by the Production Linked Incentive  (PLI) scheme and the new National Manufacturing  Mission. Infrastructure will remain a priority, buoyed  by initiatives under Gati Shakti, higher allocations for  affordable housing, and a renewed push under the  Asset Monetisation Plan. “The external sector outlook,  though exposed to global  turbulence, remains cautiously  optimistic. Ongoing trade  negotiations and regional  partnerships offer a buffer  against a volatile trade landscape.  While global financial market  volatility, geopolitical tensions,  and trade fragmentation pose  downside risks, India’s sound  macroeconomic fundamentals,  robust financial sector, and  commitment to sustainable  growth position the economy to  remain the fastest-growing major  economy in FY 2025-26.” Aditya Birla Group: Investing in People,  Leading with Purpose In an era of disruption and dynamism, the  Aditya Birla Group has held firm to a foundational  conviction that people are the ultimate differentiator.  In FY 2024-25, this belief took on a new urgency and new  scale. Our investments in talent, culture, and capability  were not just deepened, but future aligned. Through the year, 13,233 professionals joined us in the  management cadre across businesses, 76% of whom  were under the age of 35. This surge in Gen Z hiring  marks a deliberate pivot to next-generation talent that  is digital - first, agile, and ambitious. Diversity hiring  accounted for 18%, reflecting our continued commitment  to inclusion as a business strategy.  A robust pipeline of talent is the cornerstone of any  sustainable business. Internal hiring rose to 76% at senior  levels (up from 72%) and to 70% at mid- and junior levels  (from 54%), reinforcing our commitment to growing from  within. Among critical senior leadership roles, 67% were  filled by planned successors, 19% by other internal talent,  and 14% externally. These figures reflect a healthy blend of  self-reliance and fresh perspective. The engine behind this  momentum is a mix of structured leadership programmes,  mobility frameworks, and strong mentorship architecture. Learning and development remained the cornerstone  of our people strategy. Gyanodaya, our Leadership and  Learning Centre, inaugurated a new 1,58,000 sq. ft.  campus with cutting-edge infrastructure and immersive  learning technologies. Over 6,300 learners attended  programmes across future skills, leadership, and  functional competencies. The Gyanodaya Virtual Campus,  our digital learning platform, saw participation from 92% of  our workforce, touching nearly 60,000 employees. Gyanodaya - Aditya Birla Group’s Global  Center for Leadership Learning New  Campus at Navi Mumbai Our Learning Fest, a three-month Group-wide initiative,  brought future-critical themes like digital transformation,  data analytics, growth mindset, and inspirational  leadership, to the fore. More than 10,000 employees  participated, from factory floors to corporate offices,  reflecting a culture where learning is universal.  Equally, we recognise that high performance must be  underpinned by wellbeing. The Group took significant  strides in mental and physical health support this year.  Awareness programmes, counselling services, and  a network of trained Emotional First Aiders provided  critical care to over 1,400 employees and family members.

Laying Strong Foundations for  Future Growth Over the period FY 2019-20 to FY 2024-25, we have  significantly stepped up our capital expenditure spending  to over  I 67,000 crore, with more than  I 51,000 crore  allocated towards growth capex, laying the foundation  for Grasim’s transformative journey. This strategic  deployment of capital across our core and emerging  businesses reflects our confidence in the long-term  structural demand drivers and our commitment to scaling  with purpose. The investments are directed toward  capacity expansions, new-age business adjacencies,  technology upgrades, and sustainability - lin ked projects,  each designed to strengthen market leadership, enhance  operational efficiency and future-proof our businesses. Your Company’s Performance FY 2024-25 was a defining year in our journey, underscoring  the resilience and strength of our businesses. I am pleased  to share that we achieved our highest - eve r consolidated  revenue of  I 1,48,478 crore, crossing US$17 billion. We have  nearly doubled our topline over FY 2019 - 20 to F Y 2024 - 25,   representing a robust 15% CAGR, a testament to our  enduring commitment to  Force for Growth .  “Our operating performance  has been equally strong,  with consolidated EBITDA  at  I 20,023 crore, reflecting  disciplined execution and a sharp  focus on operational efficiency.”  Growth was broad-based, led by record sales volumes in  our Cement, Cellulosic Fibres, Chlorine Derivatives and  Specialty Chemicals businesses, underscoring the strength  of our market position and distribution network. This year marked a pivotal phase in your Company’s  strategic evolution, as we scaled up our new high growth  businesses, Decorative Paints and B2B E-commerce,  positioning them as key growth drivers in the years ahead.  We started commercial production at five out of six  state-of-the-art decorative paints manufacturing plants,  marking a key milestone in our foray into the high - pot ential  Decorative Paints sector. With this capacity roll-out,  Birla Opus is poised to emerge as the second - lar gest  player in the Indian decorative paints industry. The  Paints business remains steadfast in its ambition to  achieve  I 10,000 crore in revenue in its first three years of  full-scale operations. Simultaneously, our digital-led B2B E-commerce  venture, Birla Pivot, reported strong performance,  crossing  I 5,000 crore in annualised revenue run-rate (ARR)  based on fourth quarter of FY 2024-25. Birla Pivot, through  tech-enabled procurement, streamlines the traditionally  fragmented offline procurement process by providing  real-time pricing, availability, tracking, digital invoicing,  and credit options, leading to improved transparency and  efficiency. Looking ahead, we are confident to scale this  business to  I 8,500 crore (US$1 billion) in annual revenue by  FY 2026-27. Our Cement business, UltraTech, continues to fortify the  Group’s long-standing vision of being a leading global  player in the cement sector. Our overall capacity in India  has increased from 140 million tonnes to 183 million  tonnes, aided by bold organic and inorganic moves.  UltraTech’s scale and capacity footprint is unparalleled,  enabling it to service India’s growing demand for cement,  and support national infrastructure development. Our Financial Services arm, under Aditya Birla Capital,  demonstrated strong momentum, achieving a record  combined loan book (NBFC HFC) of over  I 1,57,000 crore  and the highest-ever AUM of over  I 5,00,000 crore.  Our Cellulosic Fibres and Chemicals businesses continued  to provide stability, reinforcing the strength of our  integrated value chain. Aditya Birla Renewables (ABRen)  is rapidly expanding its clean energy portfolio with an  ambition of adding 1 GW capacity annually. Leveraging a  diverse mix of solar, wind, and hybrid projects, ABRen is  committed to supporting India’s ambitious sustainability  and decarbonisation goals. In addition to powering the  Group’s own renewable energy needs, ABRen plays a  pivotal role in advancing a low-carbon future across all  companies in Aditya Birla Group. Demonstrating Scale, Value, and  Purposeful Impact Over the past decade, your Company has delivered tangible  and measurable progress across key business dimensions,   capacity expansion, revenue growth, and market  capitalisation. Through focused execution, operational  efficiency, and strategic investments, we successfully  scaled our manufacturing and service capacities to meet  rising demand across diverse sectors. This translated  into record revenues and a significant increase in market  capitalisation, reinforcing the trust placed in us by the  market and our stakeholders.  Beyond these metrics, our growth journey has been  rooted in responsibility, guided by the belief that business  success and societal progress go hand in hand. These  achievements are a testament to our ability to create  deep sectoral impact while acting as a  Force for Good ,  contributing meaningfully to the communities we serve  and the economy we help shape. This performance lays a  strong foundation for the future, as we continue to invest  in innovation, sustainability, and digital transformation to  shape long-term value for all our stakeholders. India’s Building Materials sector is witnessing a  transformative shift, driven by rapid urbanisation,  infrastructure expansion, and a renewed focus on quality,  efficiency, and sustainability. Increasing capacities  in the cement business and the launch and scale-up  of Birla Opus in Decorative Paints and Birla Pivot in  B2B E-commerce for construction materials are our  decisive steps towards building a strong, future-ready  presence in this high - pot ential sector. These steps  underscore our commitment to becoming a meaningful  player in the Indian building materials ecosystem, while  creating long - ter m value for our stakeholders. Additionally, expansion of Lyocell-based Cellulosic Fibres  represents a significant leap in sustainable innovation.  Produced from renewable wood pulp via a closed loop  process that recycles over 99% of water and solvents,  it exemplifies our commitment to eco-innovation. Over  the past decade, our Chemicals business has achieved  four times growth in Specialty Chemicals capacity,  marking a substantial transformation. Building on this  momentum, our upcoming investments target over 25%  renewable energy in caustic soda production energy mix,  and enhancing chlorine integration to 70%, furthering both  efficiency and decarbonisation. Conclusion I have long believed that the stronger we grow, the  greater the impact we create. Growth, for us, is a force  multiplier. It compels us to widen the aperture to think  more boldly about the difference we can make. It energises  us to leverage our scale, resources, and leadership to  deliver disproportionately better outcomes for all our  stakeholders, employees, consumers, partners, investors,  and society at large. This dynamic interplay, of purpose and performance,  underpinned by our proven ability to synthesise capital,  talent, and ideas, is what will shape a truly transformative  future. And through this journey, we will continue to  demonstrate, with quiet conviction, the enduring power of  business as a  Force for Good .

India is at a juncture where its rise is inevitable. A youthful  nation, full of enterprise and aspiration, is now the world’s  fourth-largest economy and well on its way to becoming the  third-largest economy. Over the past 15 years, India’s GDP  has grown nearly 5.6 times, moving from about  I 59 trillion in  FY 2009-10 to over  I 331 trillion today. Grasim’s growth has  outpaced that of the nation during the same period, with  revenues and market capitalisation growing by nearly seven  times, recording its highest-ever market capitalisation of  nearly  I 1.85 trillion (in FY 2024-25). The Indian population’s  median age of 28 years is significantly lower than China’s  39 years and the US’s 38 years, positioning the country   as a major driver of global consumption. By 2030, India’s  working - age population is expected to reach over a  billion, making up significant proportion to the global  workforce. Further, India’s share in global consumption  purchasing power parity (in PPP) is poised for significant  improvement by 2050.  The country is on track to be the future consumer  superpower, and Grasim will contribute meaningfully to  India’s consumer growth story. With the Company’s entry into  new businesses, Decorative Paints and B2B E-commerce, the  consumer connect and digital commerce expands. However,  our story is not about numbers, it is a story about choices,  about how we have grown with discipline, responsibility, and  clarity of purpose.  Bigger Ambitions, Bolder Strides The launch of our Paints business embodies the spirit of  an aspirational India. This India, teeming with dynamism,  audacity, and a penchant for disruption, finds a reflection in  our Paints venture. In fact, our Paints venture mirrors India’s  zest for innovation and its refusal to settle for status quo. Why Paints, you might wonder. The answer lies in the bedrock  of booming infrastructure expansion and the growing  construction sector. India’s construction sector, poised to  reach a US$900 billion industry and contribute 9% of GDP  in the next decade, offers an unmatched runway for growth.   However, India’s per capita paint consumption stands at just  3.5 kg, nearly a third of the global average, and far behind  that of the developed markets. For a country of our scale and  ambition, this was a call to action. Aditya Birla Group’s deep  insight into the building material ecosystem, honed over the  years offers a vantage point for our journey into the paints  industry. It is a strategic extension connecting the dots from  the foundation to the facade of homes across the nation. For  Grasim, the Decorative Paints business represents a galactic  opportunity. With rising per capita income, young population,  booming real estate sector and shorter repainting cycles, the  potential for growth in paint consumption is immense. With  long-term investment and a vision to redefine the industry  into a consumer-centric, technology-driven and transparent  practice, Grasim will act as a catalyst for change in this  100 years-old paints sector. “Grasim is already changing the  game. As per internal estimates,  Birla Opus has emerged as India’s  third-largest decorative paints brand  by revenue in less than 6 months  of pan-India operations. This is a  feat unprecedented globally in the  paints industry.”  We have already commissioned five out of six greenfield  plants, adding 1,096 MLPA capacity in FY 2024-25,  representing ~21% of the organised sector’s capacity. When  the sixth plant at Kharagpur goes live in H1 FY 2025-26, our  total capacity will rise to 1,332 MLPA, ~24% share of the  industry capacity. We now offer 176 products across 1,250+  SKUs across all six decorative paint categories, competing  at all price points. With a reach spanning over 6,600 towns,  supported by 137 depots and a pioneering retail footprint  via Birla Opus Studios and Paint Galleries, we are redefining  customer experience.   Birla Pivot, the B2B E-commerce platform is bringing  technology and trust into India’s vast and often informal  construction materials market. What began as a bold idea  has swiftly become a fast-scaling business, emerging as  a decision-making and logistics backbone for builders  and developers, dealers and contractors digitally across  India. We are helping them move faster, source better and  build smarter. With an annualised Revenue Run-rate of  over  I 5,000 crore as of Q4FY25 (4.8x growth over FY 2023 - 24),   a catalogue of 40,000 SKUs, and presence in 375 cities across  26 states, Birla Pivot is solving pain points with real impact,  and in doing so, we are enabling competitiveness for India’s  entrepreneurs and strengthening the foundation of India’s  manufacturing and construction economy.  Dear Stakeholders, FY 2024-25 was not just another financial year.  For Grasim, it marked the beginning of a defining  new chapter, an inflection point, where decades of  experience came into play to fuel ambitions for the  future. I couldn’t have asked for a more meaningful  moment to be entrusted with the responsibility  of leading Grasim as its Managing Director, w.e.f.  1 st  April 2025. At the heart of Grasim’s journey lies a simple yet  powerful idea, we have always participated in India’s  growth story. Today, Grasim is not merely a reflection of India’s  growth story. We are helping script it.  “Grasim’s diverse businesses play  a pivotal role at the heart of this  monumental nation-building  endeavour. Our cement fortifies  the expanding highways, our  fashion brands Liva and Raysil give  expression to new India, our financial  services give wings to the aspirations  of consumers, our renewable energy  supplement the electricity needs of  the nation and our chemical division  powers industries from aluminium  to textiles, fuelling the economy.” A Force for Growth,  A Catalyst for Change Himanshu Kapania Managing Director Managing Director’s Message Integrated Report      Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements      Consolidated Financial Statements 13 12 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Grasim Industries Limited 

Responsible Growth, Inclusive Future And through it all, our culture remains our strongest  differentiator. We are an enterprise that believes in long - ter m  thinking. In FY 2024-25, we redoubled our efforts to build an  organisation that is agile, inclusive and high in governance.  Our commitment to technological advancement and  responsible growth has been further validated by a landmark  investment from the International Finance Corporation  (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group.  This investment has supported our expansion in paint  manufacturing, while accelerating our decarbonisation  journey through increased adoption of renewable energy and  water recycling technologies. Aligned with our decarbonisation roadmap, we remain  committed to increasing the share of renewable power  capacity in our total energy mix and increase the share  of recycled water compared to freshwater consumption.  We remain committed to upholding the highest standards in  global sustainability practices and ensuring that our growth  contributes positively to society and the environment.  We have also committed to become a Net Zero carbon  company by 2050.  Our sustainability efforts are recognised globally and in India.  I am proud to share that Grasim got listed for the second  time in a row in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2024.  We also won the ‘Master of Risks – Conglomerate’ award  in the Large Cap category at the India Risk Management  Awards 2025, and ‘Sustainable Manufacturing Leadership  Award 2024’ by Hurun India. These recognitions testify to our  outstanding contribution in pioneering sustainable industry  leadership, driving innovation and shaping a greener future.  Future-proofing with Industry 4.0,  AI Adoption and Digitalisation At Grasim, we are committed to embracing the future  through innovation, technology, and a relentless pursuit of  excellence. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, we have  taken bold strides to integrate Artificial Intelligence and  Industry 4.0 principles across our businesses, ensuring we  remain at the forefront of transformation. Our Birla Opus brand exemplifies this vision. All Birla Opus  plants are now built with an Industry 4.0 manufacturing  technology framework, enabling end-to-end factory  automation that enhances efficiency, precision, and  sustainability. We have also reimagined the customer  experience through the Birla Opus Customer App, which  leverages AI-powered visualisation tools to help customers  envision their homes in Birla Opus colours, instantly  and intuitively.   Stronger Core, Sustainable Future At Grasim, we are driving transformation inside out.  Our established core businesses, Cellulosic Fibres,  Chemicals, Cement, Financial Services and others continue  to deliver strong performance, offering quality products and  services to meet customer requirements and healthy cash  flows providing both stability and strategic leverage.  Cellulosic Fibres has achieved the highest ever revenue  of  I 15,897 crore, growth of 6% YoY, primarily led by volume  growth and increased contribution from Specialty Fibres.   However, the profitability of this business was down by 12%  YoY due to higher prices of key inputs, which was largely  absorbed by the Company. The work on first phase of Lyocell  Fibre project of 55 KTPA, out of the total plant capacity  of 110 KTPA at Harihar, Karnataka, has commenced. This  project is expected to be commissioned by mid-2027.  In the Chemicals business, available capacity increased  by 400 TPD at the Vilayat plant with the country’s leading  capacity of caustic soda now at 1,505 KTPA. For FY 2024-25  the caustic soda sales volumes were lower by 3% YoY due to  plant shutdowns at Karwar and Balabhadrapuram for a few  days. Net realisation (ECU) in FY 2024-25 was better than  FY 2023 - 24 as global pricing improved. The ECU could have  been better but for higher negative chlorine realisations  due to continued oversupply of chlorine and lower demand  from end-user industries. Also, the Chlorine Derivatives  business performance improved significantly with focused  business development activities across the product  portfolio. Specialty chemicals, epoxy polymers and curing  agents, capacity expanded in FY 2024-25 to the highest in  the country. We enter FY 2025 - 26 wi th full available capacity  of caustic soda. The ECH and CPVC plants at Vilayat are  expected to be commissioned in FY 2025-26.  Our Cement business under UltraTech Cement has been  adding capacity at an unprecedented pace, with total  capacity (Domestic + Overseas) expected to reach 215 MTPA  by 2027. In FY 2024-25, we took a major stride forward in  UltraTech’s journey with the successful completion of  the acquisitions of India Cements, key assets of Kesoram  Cement. These landmark transactions are not merely  about scale, they are about strengthening capabilities,  deepening market presence, and delivering future-ready  solutions across India’s growing infrastructure landscape.  With these acquisitions, UltraTech significantly enhances  its manufacturing footprint, particularly in the southern  and eastern regions, and gains access to strategically  located, high-quality assets with established brand equity.  This expansion not only improves our market share but  also unlocks synergies in logistics, operational efficiency,  and customer reach. As we integrate these businesses,  Domestic Textiles has harnessed the power of GenAI in its  design studio to generate trend-aligned, in-house textile  designs. This not only accelerates our design cycle but also  ensures we stay ahead of fashion trends with creativity  and agility.  At Birla Pivot, we are redefining B2B digitisation by putting AI  at the heart of our operations. Our proprietary LLM - pow ered  engine transforms unstructured inputs, whether it’s a PDF,  a WhatsApp message, or even a handwritten note, into  structured, actionable data. This seamless conversion  capability now drives nearly 50% of our core business  journeys, enabling faster, smarter, and more intuitive  interactions across our ecosystem. Looking Ahead with Conviction India’s economic momentum is real. It is backed by  demographics, digitalisation, domestic demand, and an  increasingly resilient supply chain ecosystem. But unlocking  that momentum requires businesses that know how to  navigate complexity while creating simplicity, manage capital  prudently and invest ambitiously.  “This is the time for bold execution, careful  stewardship, and fearless imagination.  A  Force for Growth  is the manifestation  of the intent to be a builder of platforms,  a driver of scale and a catalyst of impact.”  We offer the scale of a diversified conglomerate, the speed of  a focused innovator, and the clarity of a future-led strategist.  Looking ahead, we aspire to be not only bigger but also  better, more trusted, more diversified, more digital, more  resilient, and more deeply integrated into the everyday lives  and ambitions of India’s 1.4 billion citizens. It is an extraordinary privilege to lead Grasim at this moment.  I am filled with gratitude for the visionaries before me, the  teams beside me, and the stakeholders who have been with  us. Together, let us help India grow faster and better. Warm regards, Himanshu Kapania Managing Director our commitment remains strong - to build a stronger,  smarter, and more sustainable cement business that  continues to set benchmarks in the industry. The Financial Services business under Aditya Birla Capital  has achieved highest-ever AUM of  I 5,00,000+ crore and  total lending portfolio (NBFC+HFC) of  I 1,50,000+ crore.   In FY 2024-25, Aditya   Birla Capital successfully completed  the strategic merger of its wholly owned subsidiary,  Aditya   Birla   Finance, creating a unified, larger NBFC with  enhanced operational efficiency and a simplified compliance  framework. The business has emerged as one of India’s  fastest-growing NBFCs, delivering quality and profitable  growth by strategically leveraging data, digital innovation,  and cutting-edge technology. The Renewables business under Aditya Birla Renewables is  contributing to India’s transition towards a more sustainable  future. With a growing portfolio of renewable assets across  India, the business is enabling a cleaner energy transition  while supporting the decarbonisation goals of Aditya  Birla Group companies and external customers alike.  In FY 2024 - 25, A ditya Birla Renewables delivered strong  financial performance with revenue growth of 35% YoY  to  I 509 crore. The growth was driven by capacity expansion  of ~0.6 GW during the year, with total cumulative capacity  now at 1.5 GWp. Robust Financial Performance, Consistent  Shareholder Returns For FY 2024-25, we recorded our highest ever consolidated  revenue of  I 1,48,478 crore, up from  I 1,30,978 crore in  FY 2023-24. At standalone level, Grasim revenue stood  the highest-ever at  I 31,563 crore, an impressive 22%  growth over FY 2023 - 24, r eflecting the strategic success  of our new businesses and sustained strength of our core  businesses. This robust financial performance validates the  core pillars of our strategy: market leadership, innovation,  cost leadership, sustainability, and capital allocation. Total  consolidated capital expenditure for FY 2024-25 stood  at approximately  I 17,000 crore, of which growth capex is  nearly  I 13,000 crore.  The Board has approved a final dividend of  I 10 per  share, reinforcing our legacy of consistent shareholder  value creation. This marks the 62 nd  consecutive year of  uninterrupted dividend payments, a testament to our  financial strength, resilience, and commitment to reward  the shareholders through business cycles. Additionally,  during FY 2024-25, our stock recorded its YoY returns of 14%,  significantly outperforming the benchmark (Nifty) index  by 3.8 times, reflecting both the underlying strength of our  businesses and market confidence in our strategy.

India has witnessed one of the most profound economic  transformations over the past 15 years in modern history  with its GDP nearly tripling, its infrastructure multiplying,  and its ambitions globalising. Grasim’s transformation  mirrors the shifts in India’s own development journey,  emerging as a force that touches the lives of millions  every day.  While India industrialised and digitised through reforms,  resilience and reinvention, Grasim expanded and forayed  into new‑growth sectors. As India built the highways,  homes, factories, and digital rails of the future, Grasim  supplied the cement, the fibre, the epoxy resins, the  chlorine then, and now paints, to make it happen.

Its journey began in 1983, and over the decades, it  has grown multi-fold. A pivotal moment came in 2004 when UltraTech was demerged  and became a listed entity, marking the beginning of an aggressive expansion phase,  organically and inorganically. Today, with over 190 MTPA capacity and operations  spanning across India, the Middle East, and Sri Lanka, UltraTech stands as a symbol  of strength, scale, and trust in the construction and infrastructure sector. Aspirational Consumption Grasim plays a big role into businesses that touch the lives of the Indian consumer  more directly. Grasim’s Paints business, branded Birla Opus, aims to redefine home  aesthetics with innovation, quality at its core, targeting a high-growth, consumer- facing market. Similarly, presence in premium Textiles (Linen Club) and Cellulosic  Fibres business (Liva) taps into the evolving fashion sensibilities of young India,  offering eco-friendly, natural, and comfortable choices for a modern lifestyle. Focus on Manufacturing Growth Grasim’s Chlor-Alkali and Specialty Chemicals business play a critical role in strengthening  India’s industrial backbone. From advanced materials for clean energy and electronics  to critical inputs for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and coatings, Grasim is enabling  downstream industries with reliable, locally produced inputs. With strong R&D capabilities  and backward-integrated operations, the Company is reducing India’s reliance on chemical  imports and catalysing innovation across sectors. Growing Digital Economy Birla Pivot, Grasim’s B2B digital platform, is revolutionising the way construction  materials are procured and traded in India. By bringing together a wide network of  suppliers, logistics partners, and financing options onto a single digital platform, Birla  Pivot is streamlining the supply chain for businesses of all sizes, especially MSMEs.  It offers price transparency, assured quality, and timely delivery, helping smaller  businesses operate with greater efficiency, confidence, and competitiveness. Fast Growing Renewable Energy Secto r Aditya Birla Renewables (ABRen) began its journey as Grasim’s strategic entry into  the clean energy sector, in line with India’s accelerating shift toward sustainable  energy solutions. Recognising the country’s rising power demand and its ambitious  renewable energy targets, the business was launched to cater to both the Group’s  internal needs and the growing commercial and industrial (C&I) market. As India  drives toward its goal of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, ABRen stands  well-positioned by scaling its presence pan-India across solar and wind assets.

Overview  Global Economy: Tariffs, Tensions  and Transformation The world economy demonstrated some stability in  calendar year 2024 — a year of elections that saw as  many as 60+ countries going to polls to choose their  governments and respective fiscal roadmaps. The ‘super  election year’, which included major economies like India,  France, the UK and the US, had a notable impact on policy  responses and structural reforms, providing room for  economic stability and growth.  In the second half of the year, the global economy  navigated through the dynamic interplay of geopolitical  tensions and shifting trade flows. However, growth  and inflation remained divergent across geographies.  Global headline inflation is expected to decline to 4.2%  in 2025 and to 3.5% in 2026, with advanced economies  expected to reach their inflation targets sooner than  emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs).  Due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and global  tariff uncertainties, the world is bracing for a period  of turbulence, at least in the short to medium term.  In addition, if the geopolitical tensions intensify, this  could lead to spikes in commodity prices.  In 2024, global interest rates experienced significant  shifts as central banks responded to evolving economic  conditions, including moderating inflation, geopolitical  tensions, and changing growth dynamics. In September,  the US Fed initiated a rate-cutting cycle with a 50-basis  point reduction, marking the beginning of a gradual  easing approach. Likewise, several developed and  developing market central banks implemented rate cuts  in 2024 to support growth as inflation pressures eased.  On the growth front, the World Economic Outlook of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a landscape  marked by divergent growth trajectories across regions.  Escalating trade tensions have led the IMF to revise its  global growth forecast downwards by 50 bps to 2.8% for  2025 and by 30 bps to 3.0% for 2026.  Global GDP Growth Trend (%) Regions 2024 2025F 2026F World  3.3 2.8 3.0 Advanced Economies  1.8 1.4 1.5 EMDE  4.3 3.7 3.9 Source: World Economic Outlook (WEO), April 2025; F = Forecast India: Leading Global Growth in  a Slowing World India’s economic trajectory in fiscal FY 2024-25 reflects  a resilient yet moderating growth pattern, influenced  by both domestic dynamics and global uncertainties.  The National Statistical Office (NSO) projects real GDP  growth at 6.5%, a deceleration from the 9.2% recorded in  the previous fiscal.  This slowdown is attributed to factors such as a dip in  government capex, sluggish private investments, and  overall weak private consumption growth. The share of  Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), a key indicator  for infrastructure investments, is estimated to fall to  30.1% of GDP in FY 2024 - 25 fr om 30.8% in FY 2023 - 24  in nominal terms, according to NSO, while growth in  investment demand, in real terms, is projected to slow  to 6.4% from 9%. This moderation could be linked to  the general elections overhang and the government’s  emphasis on fiscal consolidation. However, it should  not be seen as a shift away from the broader push for  infrastructure - le d growth.  The Union Budget 2025-26 introduced a series of  measures aimed at accelerating infrastructure  development, enhancing ease of doing business,  promoting green growth, empowering states through  targeted capital outlays, and providing tax incentives to  boost private consumption. These initiatives focus on  stimulating domestic demand, enhancing infrastructure  and promoting inclusive development.

Real Estate Remains Buoyant India’s real estate market had yet another  strong year, driven by surging demand in  the residential market and record leasing  demand in the commercial/office segment.  Further, improving private consumption is  providing a boost to the retail and hospitality  sectors. Rapid urbanisation and government  initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna  (PMAY), and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and  Urban Transformation (AMRUT) are driving  demand for residential, commercial, and social  infrastructure projects. PMAY-U 2.0, which was  launched in August 2024, aims to construct one  crore houses for urban poor and middle-class  families over five years. India’s infrastructure growth  remains strong, driven by  steady government capex,  with a focus on roads,  railways, ports and aviation.  India’s renewable energy  sector is on a transformative  growth path. ~218  GW India’s non-fossil fuel-based   energy capacity PMAY ‑ U 2.0, aims to  construct one crore houses  for urban poor and    middle ‑ class families over  five years. Concerted Push to Boost Discretionary  Consumer Spending  Private consumption is expected to emerge as the  primary driver of growth (7.3% YoY in FY 2024 - 25  vs. 4.0% in FY 2023 - 24), s purred by a recovery in  rural demand attributable to better agricultural  prospects. To provide relief to the middle class and,  in turn, boost private consumption, the government  increased exemption limits and lowered tax rates for  various income slabs. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  complemented the fiscal moves with two successive  25 bps cuts in its policy rate (repo), reversing its  earlier stance of raising rates and keeping it steady to  rein in inflation. To further enhance liquidity, the RBI  lowered the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50 bps to 4%,  effective from December 2024. With inflation already  easing below target, the central bank could continue  to focus on addressing demand slowdown, adopting an  accommodative stance. This coordinated effort is key  to stimulating private consumption.   Government’s Continued Thrust  on Infrastructure  India’s infrastructure growth remains strong, driven  by steady government capex, with a focus on roads,  railways, ports and aviation. The National Highway  network has expanded to 1,46,145 km, with the  construction pace increasing to 33.8 km/day in  2024. In the railway sector, the Amrit Bharat Station  Scheme is transforming 1,337 stations into modern  transit hubs with enhanced passenger amenities and  multimodal connectivity. India’s port infrastructure  is undergoing significant expansion in alignment with  the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. The government  plans to develop six mega port clusters to enhance  cargo handling capacity and bolster maritime trade.  The aviation sector is also witnessing significant  developments, with plans to develop 50 more  airports over the next five years and connect 120 new  destinations in the next decade. These concerted  efforts across various infrastructure domains  underscore India’s commitment to fostering inclusive  and sustainable economic growth. Progressing Well on Clean  Energy Transition India’s renewable energy sector is on a  transformative growth path. During the period  under review, India added a record 24.5 GW of  solar capacity and 3.4 GW of wind capacity in  a single year, taking its non-fossil fuel-based  energy capacity to 218 GW. The rooftop solar  sector also experienced significant growth,  with the installation of 4.59 GW of new  capacity, led by the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli  Yojana. Further, domestic solar PV and wind  turbine production was scaled up, in alignment  with India’s ambition to become a global RE  manufacturing hub. These efforts are part of  India’s broader strategy to achieve 500 GW of  non - fossil fuel-based energy capacity by 2030,  positioning the country as a global leader in  renewable energy. Private consumption is  expected to emerge as the  primary driver of growth. 7.3%  YoY in FY 2024-25   vs. 4.0% in FY 2023 - 24 Integrated Report      Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements      Consolidated Financial Statements 41 40 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Grasim Industries Limited Management Discussion and Analysis

The Company has doubled its energy  productivity from the 2021 base year, ahead of its 2035  target year.    85 %  Renewables to total energy mix by FY30 Expansion – Core & Adjacencies  UltraTech is strategically positioning itself for long-term  growth through a balanced mix of organic and inorganic  expansion, with total capacity, domestic and international,  projected to reach 215 MTPA by FY 2026-27. UltraTech  is expanding its footprint into adjacent segments under  the Building Products Division. In line with this strategy,  UltraTech has forayed into the Cables & Wires (C&W)  segment, with a planned investment of  I 1,800 crore. The  proposed C&W manufacturing facility, to be established in  Gujarat, will have a capacity of 35-40 lakh km.  215  MTPA Capacity by FY27 Operating Leverage UltraTech is consistently reducing its operating costs  through several strategic initiatives. These include a steady  increase in the use of green power and alternative fuels,  improved clinker conversion, and optimisation of primary  lead distances. Furthermore, better utilisation of newer  capacities is expected to enhance operating leverage.  These ongoing sustainable cost-efficiency measures aim to  achieve savings of  I 300 per metric tonne by FY 2026-27,   with  I 86/MT already realised in FY 2024-25. I 300 /tonne Cost savings by FY27 Green Growth    UltraTech remains on track to achieve its sustainability  goals, with a clear decarbonisation roadmap towards  Net Zero by 2050. UltraTech aims to use 85% clean power  (25% WHRS and 60% renewables) in the total mix by 2030,  Low Per Capita Cement  Consumption Provides  Headroom for Growth  Despite being the second largest  producer and consumer of cement  globally, India’s per capita cement  consumption at 303 kg remains  significantly below the global  average of 550 kg and China’s  1,000 kg. As developed economies  saw cement consumption peak  at 600 - 700 kg per capita before  settling near 500 kg, the Indian  cement industry has a long runway  for growth as it moves toward  similar levels of maturity. Strong Demand Driven  by Infrastructure-led  Growth Push  India is the second-largest  producer and consumer of  cement in the world. The Central  Government’s thrust on fuelling  economic growth through  infrastructure-led capex push,  housing for all, and buoyant  investment sentiment, among  others, continue to bode well  for domestic cement demand.  In fact, India’s cement demand  growth is expected to mirror  GDP growth to reach ~625 MnT  by FY 2029-30 from 435 MnT in  FY 2024-25, at a CAGR of 7-8%.  Buoyant Housing  Demand, Aided by  Rural and Urban  Recovery Rural housing will continue to  dominate cement consumption,  with an estimated share of  32-34%, as a heathy monsoon  season is expected to boost  agricultural income, which  will create housing demand.  In addition, schemes such as  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak  Yojana (PMGSY) and MGNREGA  targeted towards rural segment  will also support consumption  due to higher budgetary  allocation. The urban housing  segment, which faced headwinds  in FY 2024-25, is expected to  receive a boost with the launch of  PMAY-U 2.0.  Revenue  ( I  crore) FY24 FY25 75,955 70,908 7 %   EBITDA  ( I  crore) FY24 FY25 13,302 13,586 2 %    Outlook India’s cement consumption is likely to remain  buoyant, driven by strong demand from the  infrastructure and housing segments. With planned  capacity additions aligned with the nation’s growth  ambitions, UltraTech is well positioned to capitalise  on the existing and emerging opportunities across  the country with presence in 82 locations. For the  C&W business, it plans to start production/launch  by December 2026. Operating and Financial  Performance For FY 2024-25, consolidated volumes grew 14% YoY to  135.83 MT, with capacity utilisation at 78%. Revenue grew  7% YoY to  I 75,955 crore. EBITDA marginally declined by  2% YoY to  I 13,302 crore. Capital expenditure during the  year stood at  I 9,428 crore, of which 70% was related to  growth capex.

At the launch event in Panipat plant,  Aditya Birla Group Chairman Shri Kumar Mangalam Birla  unveiled the business strategy through a comprehensive  5D framework – “Design, Develop, Distribute, Disrupt,  Delight” to meet the needs of all stakeholders. The business  has delivered an exceptional performance in the first year  and is preparing itself to become a significant player and  create a difference in decorative paints.

Operating Context Capacity Expansion to  Meet Decadal Demand During the current financial year,  the Indian Decorative Paints  industry recorded its highest - eve r  capacity additions, with the  organised sector expanding by  ~40% YoY. An additional ~25%  capacity is expected to be  added over the next three years.  The industry is also undergoing  consolidation through mergers  and acquisitions, which are  likely to reshape the competitive  landscape. Meanwhile, aggressive  pricing strategies and a push for  low-end products by incumbents  have contributed to subdued  growth rates. However, given  the structural demand expected  over the next decade, Birla Opus  remains confident that market  share realignment, capacity  expansion, and rising brand  awareness will support a return  to double-digit growth, driven by  infrastructure development and  evolving consumer aspirations. Housing Demand and  Urbanisation India’s Decorative Paints industry  is valued at over  I 72,000 crore,  with the organised segment  comprising nearly 75%. The  industry is estimated to grow at  a CAGR of >10% over the next  decade. India’s real estate sector  demonstrated robust growth  across residential, commercial,  and alternative asset classes,  driven by urban migration,  infrastructure investments, and  evolving consumer preferences.  Government initiatives, including  the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana  Urban 2.0, aim to address housing  demands for urban poor and  middle-class families, further  stimulating the sector.  Growing Aspirations  and Premiumisation Consumers are shifting toward  premium, performance-oriented  paints. Demand for aesthetic  finishes and guided services is  rising. While traditional dealers  dominate, digital platforms,  modern retail, and painter-led  influence are reshaping how  paints are discovered and  purchased. India’s per capita  paint consumption at 3.5 kg  remains well below the global  average of approximately 10 kg  per capita, indicating substantial  headroom for further market  penetration and long - ter m  expansion opportunities.  Evolving consumer preferences  have led to shorter repainting  cycles, as people increasingly  prioritise aesthetics and choose  to refresh their spaces regularly,  even if the existing paint remains  intact. This is likely to further  fuel  demand for decorative paints.

This is the  fastest launch of such a wide range of decorative paints  product within the first year of operations by any paint  player globally.  The primary reason that Birla Opus has been able to deliver  several innovative and path-breaking products in the  water - based paints is due to pioneering development of  inhouse emulsions with molecular structure that exploits  high performance outcomes such as multi-stain resistance,  spotless finish, scuff & mar resistance and better cleanability.  Similarly, in the solvent-based paint category, Birla Opus  has developed inhouse resins with exquisite designer  molecules for corrosion resistance coatings and tailor- made molecular structure for high-end applications. This  macro molecular architecture imparts better durability  and mechanical - chem ical resistance, faster drying and  superior gloss.  This innovative chemistry has its roots in Birla Opus’  state - of - the-art R&D centre in Taloja, near Mumbai. In 2021,  the Company assembled an elite team of over 120 seasoned  scientists and chemical technologists. This hub of innovation,  equipped with a comprehensive pilot plant, has been the  birthplace of the expansive range of high-quality products.  Unique polymer synthesis process innovation and hybrid  composite polymer design through inorganic modification  have helped Birla Opus create outstanding dirt resistance,  crack bridge - abi lity, film integrity, excellent durability, high  scrub, highest whiteness and substrate adhesion. The products have undergone multiple tests for different  product features and a third party has certified that  Birla Opus products have differentiated features over leading  competition products. Birla Opus products have been  certified by NABL - acc redited GVM Test House and Research  Centre Limited. 9   out of   10 painting contractors recommend Birla Opus  for its superior product quality # Integrated Report      Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements      Consolidated Financial Statements 65 64 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Grasim Industries Limited Management Discussion and Analysis 

The ‘Make Life Beautiful’ campaign, launched in June 2024,  marked a defining moment for Birla Opus Paints. This  was the first thematic communication, and it beautifully  embodied the brand philosophy, encapsulated by the  tagline ‘Make Life Beautiful’. Birla Opus reached a large  Indian audience through the World Cup, and by mid-July,  the Out - Of-Home (OOH) presence spanned 189 cities  across the nation, reaching over 1.6 lakh trade partners,  including dealers, contractors, and AID members, digitally. Following the memorable ‘Duniya Ko Rang Do’ launch  campaign, Birla Opus rolled out its second advertising  campaign, ‘Naye Zamane Ka Naya Paint’, highlighting  innovative features such as scuff resistance, advanced  dirt pickup technology, high coverage, a 10% extra paint  promotion, and warranties of up to 16 years across the  entire product range. The campaign not only generated  significant brand awareness but also successfully  encouraged trials, particularly during the festive season.  Resonating with customers across diverse touchpoints,  brand Birla Opus has established itself as a paint brand  of choice for today’s discerning customers. In addition to  the television media, digital media campaigns on YouTube  and other social media platforms have been launched and  greatly appreciated by consumers. Birla Opus has built  record brand awareness through 360-degree integrated  campaigns with consistent presence on air from June 2024  onwards. Birla Opus bagged 5 EMVIES award in different  categories for its innovative and integrated media campaign  and ranked overall 6 th  brand in terms of best client of the  year 2025. Birla Opus has got excellent product and applicability  feedback about quality and services across the entire  product range from consumers, dealers, franchisees,  contractors, painters, architects, and interior designers.  For consumers to experience this, Birla Opus has taken  on itself the responsibility to transform the decorative  paints retailing industry by building its own experience  stores (known as Birla Opus Paint Studio) in the metros and  franchising mid-sized stores across India called Birla Opus  Paint Gallery. Birla Opus has built retail footprint across  300+ towns, company-owned Paint Studios in 11 major  cities, creating flagship experience centres. This network  is critical to build brand salience and drive both throughput  and premium products sale.  FY25     FY26 Birla Opus has six strategically located, integrated, and  global scale manufacturing plants with high level of  automation and total commercial production capacity  of 1,332 MLPA (million litres per annum), making it the  second largest Indian decorative player by installed  capacity. As on 31 st  March 2025, commercial production  commenced at five locations namely Ludhiana (Punjab),  Panipat (Haryana), Cheyyar (Tamil Nadu), Chamarajanagar  (Karnataka) and Mahad (Maharashtra) with total installed  capacity of 1,096 MLPA. The project work at Kharagpur  (West Bengal) is progressing well and trial production  run is expected to start in H1FY26. Birla Opus has its own  wallpaper manufacturing facility to cater to the demands of  Indian consumers.  Birla Opus is amongst the few players in India with fully  backward integrated plants producing its own emulsions  and resin products. The business has manufacturing  capacity of over 375 MLPA of emulsion and 90 MLPA  of resins from its plants that are capable of taking care  of their own needs and surplus for the Indian market.  Sustainability is inherently integrated into the design of  Birla Paint Manufacturing Facility. Birla Opus has installed  and commenced the operations with Zero Liquid Discharge  Systems (ZLDS), with close to ~24,000 KL being recycled  back into the process. Birla Opus has adopted an Industry 4.0 IoT-driven approach  for end-to-end factory automation. This includes advanced  infrastructure such as an automated storage and retrieval  system (ASRS) for packing materials (PM), seamless PM  transfer to fully automated, high-speed, and high-precision  packing lines via an electro monorail system, as well as the  use of de-nesters, de-palletisers, and automated guided  vehicles (AGVs). This is followed by robotic palletisation of  finished goods (FG) and transfer of FG to FG ASRS through  sortation transfer vehicle and dispatch of FG through the  same system based on dynamic delivery requirement. This  high level of factory automation is governed through MES  and EWM system.

In a pioneering industry  move, Birla Opus has also implemented a QR-based system  on paint cans, enabling end-to-end traceability from  production to application.

Strategic Focus Areas With the ambition to scale to  I 8,500 crore (US$1 billion)  in revenue in two years, Birla Pivot aims to become India’s  most trusted B2B E-commerce platform. The focus is  on building networked scale across price, assortment,  and experience, while creating platform-led solutions for  credit, fulfilment, and last-mile support. The evolution and  adoption of digital first solutions by India’s 70 million+ small  businesses provide the perfect foundation for this shift. Our strategic focus areas continue to be around building  scale and delivering a great experience across every single  transaction. To build scale, we will continue to expand into  newer customer segments and grow the width and depth  of the assortment that we have on the platform. To deliver  a great experience, we will continue to invest in scaling our  personalised credit solutions and build a stronger logistics  and fulfilment infrastructure that is required to serve  customers of all sizes. Our Brands from the House of Birla Pivot Platform Shift is  Inevitable Just as B2C evolved from  unstructured marketplaces  to integrated platforms,  B2B is expected to move from  listing - based models to full-stack  procurement ecosystems with  embedded credit, tech-enabled  fulfilment, and category expansion.  A unified, end-to-end digital  experience will be a game changer. Operating Context A US$200 Billion  Growth Trajectory  Underway Indian B2B market is one of the  largest and the fastest growing  globally and is estimated to  be US$4 trillion by 2030E.  Online first, tech-enabled  B2B marketplaces represent  a remarkable US$200 billion  market opportunity within that.   Digital penetration today in  B2B commerce is still under 2%,  indicating massive headroom for  scalable digital-first platforms.  While businesses have embraced  digital tools like GST filing and UPI  payments, procurement remains  largely offline, localised, and  dependent on intermediaries. Structural  Inefficiencies Limit  MSME Growth Despite rising demand,  MSMEs that power India’s B2B  sector, remain constrained  by fragmented supply chains,  opaque pricing, credit  bottlenecks, and low digital  adoption. The ecosystem remains  intermediary-heavy, offline-first,  and hyper-localised, with limited  presence of scaled distributors  or digital platforms. These  frictions erode margins, reduce  competitiveness, and inhibit  scale. However, this complexity  also presents white space for  full-stack, tech-led solutions to  manage end-to-end needs of  buyers and sellers.  Outlook India’s B2B commerce, valued at over  US$200 billion, remains largely fragmented and  under-served by digital platforms (~2% digital  penetration). As we step into FY 2025-26, our focus  is clear: scaling our core and seeding future growth.  We will continue to strengthen our foundation by  scaling up our customer base, expanding credit  programmes, driving sourcing efficiency, and  accelerating digitisation. Our B2B E-commerce  revenue continues to grow in line with the plan and  remains on track to achieve revenue of US$1 billion    ( ` 8,500 crore) by FY 2026-27. Operating and Financial  Performance In FY 2024-25, Birla Pivot has built the capability to  provide a wide assortment of products across Building  Materials (Foundational, Interior, and finishing categories),  Non - Ferrous metals and Chemicals. We have launched  and scaled up private labels in three key categories: Tiles,  Ply and Bathware under the Birla Pivot brand name. With a  robust network of suppliers and transport partners, we have  deliveries spanning more than 4,000 pin codes across 375  cities and serve customers across the country.  Our competitive pricing is driven by demand aggregation  across categories and strategic partnerships with OEMs  and regional brands. To further support ecosystem  efficiency, we offer customised, end-use-restricted  financing solutions that optimise working capital for both  buyers and sellers. These are powered by Pivot Vault, our  custom-built intelligent workflow system that connects  with multiple lenders and actively monitors portfolio health.  To enable seamless, scalable operations, we have   developed unassisted journeys for buyers, sellers, and  internal teams, ensuring digitisation and end-to-end  visibility across the value chain. Our buyer interface, Pivot  Edge, provides a self-serve platform with features like  an orders dashboard, real-time tracking, and automated  proof-of-delivery. On the seller side, Pivot Grid acts as a  one-stop dashboard with self-invoicing and performance  analytics. Fulfilment is further strengthened by Birla Pivot  Logistics, which ensures a reliable delivery experience  improving on-time, in-full (OTIF) rates and reducing freight  costs.

Huge Credit    Gap MSMEs have emerged as a  key growth engine in India’s  economic development, with  the sector accounting for 30%  of the nation’s GDP. However,  despite improvements in credit  access, there exists a significant  addressable credit gap in the  market, especially for those with  limited credit history. The Expert  Committee on MSMEs, constituted  by the RBI, estimates credit gap  in the sector at  I 20 - 25 lakh crore,  which provides a large addressable  market for the Financial  Services industry.    Competitive Strengths Our Platforms ABCD Omnichannel  D2C platform Udyog Plus B2B platform  for MSMEs Stellar B2D platform for  channel partners Operating Context Strategic Focus Areas Customer Centricity and Growth Customer-centricity is a key element of our strategy to grow  the business, with a focus on building a granular franchise.  We are scaling up our Udyog Plus platform, to provide  differentiated offerings for MSMEs, acquire new customers,  tap into the ABG ecosystem, focus on E-commerce  partnerships, and integrate with public infrastructures  such as OCEN (Open Credit Enablement Network) and  ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce).

Technology has been a key  enabler of financial inclusion,  with UPI driving digital payments,  data and analytics leading to  innovative credit assessment and  underwriting, thereby expanding  access to the underserved and  unserved segments. Growing  Financialisation  With growing disposable  income and increasing financial  awareness, Indians are exploring  multiple options beyond the  traditional avenues of savings  and investments to create a  secure financial future. This  change in consumer preferences  is increasing demand for diverse  solutions across savings,  investments, protection, and  payments needs. Further,  relatively low penetration of  mutual funds as well as insurance  provides significant headroom  for growth, as reflected in the  emergence of new age fintech  companies and platforms that are  reimagining the last mile delivery.

Over the years, we have not only transformed  the Indian fashion landscape but also evolved our business  model, moving beyond manufacturing to building iconic,  consumer - loved brands.”  Kapil Agrawal Business Head Jasvinder Kataria Chief  Executive Officer Ashok Machher Chief  Financial Officer Chandra  Bhattacharjee Chief Human  Resources Officer Business Overview Grasim’s Textiles business is structured around three  strategic business units (SBUs), each focused on natural  fibres and integrated across key stages of the textile  value chain. The largest of these is the Linen segment,  which stands out for its premium sourcing and end-to-end  capabilities. We procure the finest flax fibres from France,  Belgium, and the Netherlands, renowned for their superior  quality, and transform them into high-grade linen yarn,  fabric, and apparel. While our linen yarn and fabric are  supplied to downstream partners, our apparel segment  operates on an outsourced garmenting model, allowing  us to scale efficiently while maintaining a strong brand  presence in the premium fashion space.  Expanding our portfolio of natural fibre offerings, we also  operate ‘Cavallo’, a contemporary brand that blends natural  fabrics such as linen and cotton, catering to evolving  consumer preferences for comfort and sustainability.  In our Wool segment, we produce high-quality wool tops  and worsted yarn sourced from fine Merino wool, which  are eventually supplied to leading downstream apparel  manufacturers. Our premium cotton fabric division further  strengthens our presence in the luxury fabric market, with  products sold under globally recognised brands such as  ‘SOKTAS’ and ‘Giza House.’ The retail arm of Grasim’s Textiles  business, led by our flagship brand  ‘Linen Club’, has established one of  the largest single-brand franchise  networks in India. With a presence  in over 240 exclusive brand outlets  (EBOs) and more than 9,000  multi - brand outlets (MBOs), Linen  Club continues to set the benchmark  in premium linen retail.

Strategic Focus Areas Retail Presence We remain committed to positioning ‘Linen Club’, ‘SOKTAS’,  and ‘Giza House’ as cornerstone retail brands in the  Indian textile landscape. Over the past five years, we  have significantly expanded our retail footprint, adding  60+ exclusive brand outlets (EBOs) and scaling up our  presence to over 9,000+ multi-brand outlets (MBOs). This  strategic growth reflects our focus on deepening market  reach, enhancing brand visibility, and strengthening our  connection with consumers nationwide. Innovation and Sustainability We are driving innovation in sustainable textiles by  developing blends of linen with natural fibres like cotton and  viscose under our brand Cavallo, making premium fabrics  more accessible and versatile. Our recent launches include  Silk Touch, a biodegradable, cellulosic fabric with a luxurious  silk-like feel, and our Circular Solutions line, which uses  recycled linen from pre-consumer waste. These initiatives  reflect our commitment to reducing environmental impact,  managing raw material costs, and creating future-ready,  eco-conscious textile solutions. Operating and Financial  Performance In line with our business strategy to shift from pure  manufacturing to establishing iconic brands in some  of these categories, the B2C revenues for the segment  grew by 4% YoY. Textiles segment revenue stood at  I 2,222  crore in FY 2024-25 against  I 2,217 crore in FY 2023-24.  Linen performance was severely impacted due to demand  slowdown and exceptionally high flax prices. EBITDA  for FY 2024-25 stood at  I 1 crore as against  I 168 crore in  FY 2023-24.

Apparel  accounts for the second-largest share in the  retail basket, nearly 10%, trailing only food,  groceries, and general merchandise. This  share is expected to grow, underpinned by  India’s favourable demographics. A young  and increasingly affluent population, coupled  with greater exposure to media and digital  platforms, is more inclined to adopt emerging  fashion trends. This shift in consumer  behaviour is fuelling demand for lifestyle and  premium products, making the textile sector  a compelling space for long-term investment.  Outlook Market sentiment toward premium clothing  remains subdued, with dealers holding elevated  inventory levels. Geopolitical tensions, particularly  in Europe, are impacting demand in global markets.  Meanwhile, India is emerging as one of the  world’s most dynamic fashion markets, driven by  rising disposable income, growing E-commerce  penetration and strong demand from Tier 2/Tier  3 cities. Our Linen business is a trusted name in  premium natural fabrics. We are also transforming  from pure manufacturing to building iconic  consumer brands, deepening retail footprint and  entering fast-growing categories.

Strategic Focus Areas Commercial & Industrial (C&I) Segment We continue to expand our presence in the C&I segment,  serving both Aditya Birla Group companies and external  clients. Our strategy involves establishing centralised  renewable energy (RE) plants comprising solar and wind  connected to the Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS)  at strategic locations. This approach ensures high capacity  utilisation factors (CuF) and delivers competitively priced  power to our customers. Operating Context India remains the third-largest energy consumer, following  China and the United States. With a population exceeding  1.4 billion and an economy on the track to become the  third-largest globally by 2030, nation’s energy demand is  projected to grow at an annual rate of 6.0–6.5% through  FY 2029-30. This surge is driven by rapid urbanisation,  industrialisation, digitalisation, and the electrification of  transportation and industrial sectors. In the summer of 2025, India’s peak power demand  is expected to reach 277 GW, up from over 250 GW  in 2024. This increase underscores the need for robust  infrastructure and diversified energy sources to meet the  growing demand. India has made significant strides in renewable energy, with  installed capacity reaching 232 GW by May 2025, tripling  from 75.52 GW in March 2014. Solar energy plays a pivotal  role, accounting for approximately 48% of the renewable  mix, with an installed capacity of 107.95 GW. The country  aims to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030,  aligning with its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2070.  Outlook India’s renewable energy sector is poised for  continued growth, driven by government initiatives  and technological advancements. The National  Green Hydrogen Mission aims to position India as  a global leader in green hydrogen production. This  will further increase the demand for solar power,  as green hydrogen production relies heavily on  clean electricity. Under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI)  scheme, the government is bolstering domestic  manufacturing of solar PV modules, cells, and  wafers, reducing import dependence and  strengthening the local supply chain. The solar market is projected to grow at a CAGR  of over 13.35% through 2033, with significant  investments in utility-scale solar parks, rooftop  installations, and floating solar projects. As India advances towards its ambitious energy  goals, Aditya Birla Renewables remains committed  to driving sustainable progress. Through strategic  foresight and innovative solutions, we aim to power  not just businesses but the nation’s transition to a  greener and more resilient energy future.

Risk Governance Structure Board of Directors Risk Management    and Sustainability    Committee (RMSC) Risk Management   Facilitator Business Risk Management   Committee (BRMC) Unit Risk Management    Committee (URMC) Effective enterprise risk management  is essential not only for safeguarding  value but also to capitalise on emerging  opportunities responsibly and  sustainably. We have institutionalised  a robust Enterprise Risk Management  (ERM) framework, grounded in the core  principles of being Predictive, Proactive,  and Prepared. This approach enables us  to anticipate risks, respond swiftly to  evolving scenarios, and build resilience  across our operations. We operate in an increasingly  dynamic and interconnected global  environment. Our diverse businesses  are exposed to a broad spectrum of  risks. The Indian economy continues to  witness structural changes, accelerated  digital transformation, and evolving  stakeholder expectations, all of which  demand a proactive and integrated  approach to risk management.  We have institutionalised a structured, multi-tiered  risk governance framework to ensure comprehensive  oversight and management of risks across all  organisational levels. This structure enables  both top - down a nd bottom-up identification and  management of risks. The Board of Directors is supported by the Risk  Management & Sustainability Committee (RMSC), which  includes a nominated Chairman, Business Heads, the  Risk Management Facilitator, Chief Financial Officer, and  Chief Sustainability Officer. The RMSC defines the risk  management policy and oversees the implementation of  the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. 1.   Business Heads 2.   Business CXOs 3.

We employ a structured  Risk Assessment Matrix to evaluate risks across two  key dimensions: Impact (Consequence):  Assessed based on the  potential impact on the business, including operational  disruption, safety outcomes, compliance breaches,  reputational damage, EBITDA impact etc. Probability (Likelihood):  Evaluated according  to the estimated frequency or likelihood of the  risk materialising. Risk Tolerance Grasim defines risk appetite as the level of residual risk  the organisation is willing to accept in pursuit of its  strategic and operational objectives, after implementing  appropriate risk mitigation measures. Risk Assessment Likelihood Consequence / Impact Regular Possible Likely Unlikely Minor Moderate High Extreme Foreign   currency   fluctuation    risk * Foreign   currency   fluctuation    risk # Interest    Rate risk # Interest    Rate   risk * # Inherent Risk, *Residual Risk Risk Culture Building a strong risk culture is essential for informed decision-making and long-term business resilience. Our approach  extends beyond compliance, emphasising proactive understanding, ownership, and integration of risk management  principles at all organisational levels. This includes education and training programmes for Directors, senior executives,  employees, and others.   At Grasim, risk management is integral to every decision. Risk considerations are embedded early in the product and  service development process to ensure sustainability, compliance, and market relevance. Once risks are identified and  mitigation plans defined, each risk is assigned an owner. Key risk indicators are identified and monitored, incorporated into  the KRAs of the respective managers, and factored into performance evaluations and financial incentives. Key Risks and their Mitigation Plans We have systematically identified and assessed a spectrum of risks inherent in our operations, encompassing strategic,  operational, knowledge, compliance, financial, and sustainability risks. By anticipating potential threats and addressing  emerging challenges, we enhance operational resilience and safeguard shareholder value. Each risk is managed through  tailored, comprehensive mitigation strategies.

Emerging Risks Internal Control System Grasim has a robust internal control system,  commensurate with the nature, size, scale, and  complexity of its operations. These controls cover all key  business processes and are supported by a well-defined  organisational structure with clearly assigned roles and  responsibilities. The system is regularly reviewed to ensure  alignment with the Company’s growth.  The Audit Committee evaluates the Internal audit  programme at the beginning of each year to ensure  adequate coverage of key risk areas. Internal audits  are conducted across all units and functions by  reputed internal auditors, who report directly to the  Audit Committee, ensuring independent oversight  and accountability.  Internal Audit plays a critical role in strengthening the  organisation’s governance framework by providing  independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk  management, internal controls, and compliance processes.  Through periodic, risk-based audits across various business  functions and operations, the internal auditor identifies and  addresses control gaps proactively.   The Audit Committee periodically reviews audit findings,  management’s responses, and undertakes corrective  action. It also provides necessary guidance to ensure  that adequate internal controls are in place and  operating effectively. Description Grasim is increasingly adopting latest technologies, including use of AI in its manufacturing, planning and review  processes. AI is transforming industries with unprecedented speed, offering automation, predictive analytics, and  decision-making capabilities. However, alongside these benefits, AI introduces a range of emerging risks that can  adversely affect the organisation. These risks stem from the misuse, misalignment, or malfunction of AI systems, and they  are becoming increasingly relevant as AI adoption accelerates across sectors.  The consequences of adverse AI outcomes include data breaches, reputational damage, regulatory penalties, and loss of  stakeholder trust. The misuse of generative AI tools can lead to intellectual property violations, misinformation, or internal  security breaches. AI systems, especially those powered by machine learning and large language models, can behave  unpredictably when exposed to new data or environments. They may generate biased outputs, make opaque decisions,  or be exploited through adversarial attacks. Moreover, the lack of clear regulatory frameworks, ethical standards, and  internal governance can amplify these risks.   Impact   − Operational and Security Risks:  AI systems can be  exploited through adversarial inputs or manipulated  to leak sensitive data. Poorly secured AI tools may  become entry points for cyberattacks, threatening  business continuity.   − Reputational Damage:  Biased or harmful outputs from  AI systems such as discriminatory hiring algorithms  or offensive chatbot responses can lead to public  backlash and a loss of customer trust.    − Regulatory and Legal Exposure:  Misuse of AI may  violate data protection laws, intellectual property  rights, or emerging AI regulations. Non-compliance  can result in fines, lawsuits, or restrictions on AI usage.   − Workforce Disruption and Ethical Concerns:  Over- reliance on AI without proper oversight can lead to  job displacement, employee dissatisfaction, and  ethical dilemmas, particularly when AI decisions lack  transparency or fairness. Mitigation Action   − Establish AI Usage Policies : Define clear internal  policies for AI deployment, covering acceptable use,  data handling, and ethical guidelines. Ensure that  all AI tools used within the organisation are formally  approved and consistently monitored.   − Adopt Private AI Models : Use secure, private AI  models instead of public or open-access tools to  strengthen data privacy, protect intellectual property,  and maintain greater control over model behaviour.   − Upskilling and Training : Provide regular training to  employees on responsible AI usage, associated risks,  and best practices. Empower teams to identify and  report AI-related concerns at an early stage.   − Continuous Monitoring and Governance : Establish  governance framework to monitor AI developments,  assess risks, and update controls. Stay informed about  regulatory changes and evolving industry standards. Description As a diversified conglomerate, Grasim faces growing exposure to geo-economic confrontation, global trade tensions,  and the imposition of reciprocal tariffs. These factors can result in increased raw material and other input costs, directly  affecting operational margins. Higher tariffs may increase inflation, dampen consumer sentiment, and reduce discretionary spending, leading to lower  demand and pressure on finished goods prices. This creates a dual impact for Grasim: increased input costs and shrinking  market demand, both of which can adversely affect overall business performance. Impact   − Operational Costs:  Increased tariffs raise the cost  of imported raw materials, impacting input costs and  profit margins.   − Market Demand:  Inflation-driven consumer price  increases can suppress demand for end products.   − Revenue Pressure:  Reduced sales volumes with  competitive pricing pressure can negatively  affect profitability.   − Global Competitiveness:  Trade barriers may  limit market access and disrupt global supply  chain dynamics. Mitigation Action   − Supply Chain Diversification:  Grasim explores  alternative sourcing strategies and local procurement  to reduce dependency on high-tariff regions.   − Cost Optimisation:  Operational efficiencies and lean  manufacturing practices are implemented to mitigate  cost pressures.   − Policy Engagement:  Active dialogue with industry  bodies and government stakeholders helps  anticipate regulatory changes and align business  strategies accordingly.

Regular assessments enable timely  upgrades and better planning, enabling responsible  resource use while maintaining cost - effe ctiveness and  operational efficiency. Value Creation and Protection through  Water and Solvent Management Overview Water and solvent are essential inputs in paint  manufacturing, particularly during cleaning operations  between production cycles. Their extensive use results  in significant freshwater withdrawal and increased  operational costs. Birla Opus has addressed these  challenges through effective recovery and reuse  systems that enhance resource efficiency and reduce  environmental impact. Our approach to circularity  in resource management is strengthened by water  replenishment initiatives across our operating regions,  alongside advanced wash water and solvent reuse  systems within our manufacturing facilities. Solution Wash Water Management Water is a shared natural resource, and we manage  it responsibly through advanced solutions such as  self - cleaning filters, ZLD systems, closed-loop cleaning,  and wash water reuse. In paint manufacturing, wash  water is generated during equipment cleaning. To  address this, we have implemented reuse technologies  aligned with circular economy principles. Wash Solvent Management Our solvent management strategy ensures the  responsible use of solvents across our operations.  In paint manufacturing, significant volumes of wash  solvent are generated during equipment cleaning.  To enable reuse, we have developed dedicated wash  solvent reuse infrastructure. Advanced solutions  such as self-cleaning filters, automatic nozzles, and  wash solvent reuse systems have been implemented  to minimise waste, improve efficiency, and reduce  environmental impact.  Guidelines and Governance for Reuse To ensure the effective reuse of both wash water and  wash solvent, we have established comprehensive  guidelines covering product-specific reuse eligibility,  storage conditions, testing frequencies, and hygiene  protocols. Reuse is permitted only when stringent quality  standards are consistently met, safeguarding product  integrity and safety. Impact In the first year of commercial operations, substantial  volumes of wash water and wash solvent were  successfully reused. This reduced the reliance on fresh  inputs and promoted more efficient resource utilisation.  These initiatives have enhanced waste management and  delivered measurable cost savings. Future Outlook Looking ahead, we would continue to upgrade our  storage, testing, and automation systems to improve  segregation and enable greater reuse across additional  product lines. Our continued focus on resource reuse  supports our sustainability goals and reinforces  our position as an industry leader in responsible  resource management.

Optimising Yarn Twist for Operational  Efficiency - Veraval  Overview The Cellulosic Filament Yarn (CFY) manufacturing  process, a legacy practice based on imported  technology, involved imparting 100 twists per metre  (TPM) using Two-for-One (TFO) twisters. However,  downstream customers typically apply much higher  twist levels, depending on the fabric application. This  condition highlighted an opportunity to optimise internal  processes by modifying twist levels, thereby improving  energy efficiency and production effectiveness without  compromising yarn quality. Solution We optimised the twist levels in the TFO machines.  Initial trials confirmed product integrity both  internally and with customers. Following successful  validation, the revised process was extended to meet  customer requirements.  Impact •   Improved Energy Efficiency:  Optimal twist levels  significantly reduced power consumption across  operations, thereby reducing carbon emissions. •   Cost Savings:  Reduced process waste and  improved resource utilisation led to lower  operational costs. •   Enhanced Product Quality:  Increased product  value and customer satisfaction. •   External Recognition:  The initiative earned  awards for innovation, sustainability, and  operational excellence. Optimising Exhaust Blower Speed for  Energy Efficiency – Kalyan  Overview In the calcination section of the Spin Bath process,  hydrous sodium sulphate is converted into anhydrous  sodium sulphate through a high-temperature drying  system. The exhaust blower, previously operating  continuously at high RPMs, consumed excessive energy  and affected operating conditions. In FY 2024–25, the  plant initiated an optimisation initiative to reduce blower  speed, aiming to improve energy efficiency, enhance  process control, and reduce salt emissions. Solution A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) was installed on the  calcination exhaust blower, enabling precise control of  blower speed. This adjustment reduced airflow velocity,  thus improving the operating conditions and increasing  the residence time of hot air within the dryer. As a result,  drying efficiency improved without affecting throughput. Impact •   Energy Efficiency:  Lowered overall  power consumption. •   Improved Process Performance:  Longer hot air  retention increased salt temperature and drying  efficiency, boosting process stability.

This led  to daily steam savings, reduced freshwater   intake,  and improved energy efficiency. 3.   STP & ETP Water Reuse CSY Plants     We have utilised the recycled wastewater into our  core processes, resulting in annual water savings. This  initiative reinforced our commitment to sustainable  water management. Revamping Effluent Treatment for  Enhanced Compliance and Capacity  Overview In FY 2024–25, we undertook a major revamp of  the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) at our Veraval  unit to address fluctuating effluent loads and meet  increasingly stricter discharge norms. The existing  ETP, which relied solely on primary treatment,  struggled to maintain compliance, particularly  during shock loads. To mitigate environmental and  operational risks, we aimed to enhance treatment  efficiency, improve effluent quality, and increase  plant capacity in line with our sustainability and  compliance goals. Solution The project involved upgrading the ETP to  a higher capacity and integrating advanced  treatment technologies to ensure more robust and  reliable performance.  Key enhancements included: •   Add-on Equalisation Tank:  Stabilises influent  flow and pollutant load •   Flash Mixing and Flocculation Tanks:  Improve  solid-liquid separation •   High-Rate Solid Contact Clarifier (HRSCC):  Enhances settling efficiency and reduces  suspended solids in the final discharge Impact •   Ensured consistent compliance with effluent  discharge norms. •   Increased treatment capacity and resilience  during peak load conditions. •   Improved discharge quality, reducing  environmental impact. •   Strengthened operational efficiency and overall  sustainability performance. CASE STUDY  Water Risk Assessment To proactively manage evolving water availability  challenges, we conduct comprehensive water risk  assessments focussing on two key areas: dependency- related and impact-related risks. Dependency-related Water Risks:  We assess our reliance  on freshwater sources critical to operations, evaluating  regional water availability and the potential impacts of  scarcity on production. Impact-related Water Risks:  We analyse how our water  use affects local ecosystems and communities, including  implications for water quality, availability and broader  environmental health. To support these assessments, we use the Aqueduct tool,  which provides insights into baseline water stress, flood  frequency, and drought severity, helping us evaluate the  sustainability of our water sources. We have implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems  at 13 facilities, with one unit under commissioning,  significantly reducing water discharge and recyclability.  Additionally, we are expanding the use of desalinated  seawater through Sea Water RO systems, thereby reducing  dependence on freshwater sources. These initiatives  underscore our commitment to water stewardship and  long-term sustainability. Focus Area 4 Waste Management Building on our robust system of waste minimisation,  recycling, and safe disposal, we are advancing towards a  more innovative, technology-driven, and circular economy  approach to enhance sustainability and operational  efficiency. Our waste management framework prioritises  reducing waste at the source by optimising resource use  and adopting closed-loop systems that enable the reuse of  by-products within manufacturing processes, significantly  reducing both raw material consumption and waste output. Waste audits help identify opportunities to improve  efficiency and reduce waste generation, supporting the  establishment of quantified waste reduction targets.  We implement targeted actions to minimise waste, with  a strong focus on innovation and R&D to reduce it at  its source. Efficient waste segregation is institutionalised across  all sites, ensuring the proper handling of hazardous and  non - hazardous waste in full compliance with regulatory  requirements. Continuous employee training promotes  best practices in waste handling and reinforces a culture of  sustainability. This social dimension also safeguards worker  health and supports community well-being by mitigating  environmental risks.

Waste to Wealth - PAC Sludge Reutilisation:   We reduced hazardous waste disposal to landfill  by reusing PAC sludge in in-house liquid alum  manufacturing, aligning with our zero waste to  landfill objective. Note: Initiatives mentioned in our FY 2023-24 Annual Report have  continued into FY 2024-25.  Reduction and Utilisation   of Brine Sludge Overview At our Chlor-alkali manufacturing facility, the  generation of brine sludge with high NaCl content  posed environmental and compliance challenges  due to its disposal in landfill sites. The sludge was  unsuitable for reuse and required costly hazardous  waste disposal. Our objective was to minimise brine  sludge generation and enhance its potential for  circular applications, such as in brick manufacturing. Solution We used washed salt in the brine preparation  process, which significantly reduced the NaCl  content in the resulting sludge. A filter press system  was installed to improve sludge separation efficiency.  Additionally, we optimised process parameters,  such as slurry dilution and cake washing time, to  further lower residual salt. These improvements  ensured the sludge met quality standards for reuse  in construction. Impact These interventions would lead to a reduction  in annual brine sludge generation and ensure  compliance with environmental regulations. Further  work is going on to render the sludge suitable for  brick manufacturing and/or cement co-processing.   This initiative reflects our commitment to sustainable  waste management and advancing circular  economy practices.

These initiatives form a core  part of its broader CSR engagement, delivered through  the Grasim Jana Sewa Trust in collaboration with expert  partners including Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation,  Aide et Action, and Grameen Vikas Trust.  To evaluate outcomes and inform future planning,  a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was conducted in  September 2024 by Eurofins Assurance in collaboration  with ASK Training & Learning. The assessment used a  mix of household surveys (810 respondents), focus group  discussions, interviews, and on-ground observations. Key findings highlight significant progress in access to  healthcare, education, and livelihoods. About 76% of  households reported benefiting from health services  and 73% reported improved overall well-being. Education  initiatives, including the Anandwadi model, led to  increased school engagement and awareness among  children. Support for livestock and horticulture has  strengthened food security and boosted income in  several households, though persistent challenges such as  water scarcity and limited fodder access remain. Women’s empowerment programmes recorded strong  participation in training, but economic outcomes have  been limited due to social barriers and gaps in market  access. Infrastructure development has improved water  supply, hygiene, and sanitation across most villages. The study recommends strengthening partnerships  with local institutions, expanding support in education  and healthcare, and implementing targeted follow-up  strategies to enhance women’s economic inclusion. Overall, the assessment reflects strong community  engagement and measurable progress since 2021, while  offering a clear roadmap to improve sustainability and  deepen impact in the years ahead. “Previously unaware of what constituted a good school  or quality education, I never imagined our village’s  government schools could improve. Now, there’s  newfound community awareness; children attend  regularly despite field or brick kiln obligations. Thanks to  Grasim Jana Seva Trust and Aide et Action, the school  runs smoothly with peak attendance. Children maintain  cleanliness and good behaviour. I now understand  the concept of quality education and see government  schools as centres of excellence. Proud to be part of  this campaign.” Shankar Gurjar President - Parmarkedi Village Panchayat Social and Relationship Capital Integrated Report      Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements      Consolidated Financial Statements 193 192 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Grasim Industries Limited 

Focus Area 2 Supply Chain Management At Grasim, our supply chain is anchored in transparency,  accountability, and a shared sense of purpose. We engage  with suppliers through open dialogue and alignment on  mutual goals, ensuring they meet our high standards of  quality, responsibility, and compliance. Built on long - ter m  partnerships and consistent, ethical practices, our supply  chain, rooted in long-term partnerships and ethical  practices,  upholds integrity throughout every stage  of operations. Supply Chain Governance We have formalised our responsible procurement approach  through our Suppliers Code of Conduct and Responsible  Supply Chain Policy, which define our engagement and  collaboration with supply chain partners. Aligned with global frameworks, the Suppliers Code  of Conduct embeds ESG principles and sets clear  expectations in areas like health and safety, environmental  impact, business integrity, and labour rights. These  include fair wages, decent living conditions, reasonable  working hours, and the right to freedom of association and  collective bargaining.  The Responsible Supply Chain Policy promotes transparent  sourcing, effective risk management, and supplier capability  development, focusing on sustainability across the value  chain and supporting local businesses, MSMEs, and  under - represented groups. Compliance is essential to our supply chain governance  requiring alignment with relevant laws, the ABG  Sustainability Framework, and applicable standards. Suppliers Tier 1 Suppliers High-volume suppliers,  including raw materials,  engineering materials, and  service providers Significant Tier 1 Suppliers Non-substitutable suppliers,  including single-source vendors  Other Tier 1 Suppliers High-risk suppliers, including  suppliers with risks related  to environment, safety,  and compliance  Strategic Supplier Classification We classify our suppliers into Tier 1 and non-Tier 1 categories, based on their level of engagement and procurement  value. Tier 1 suppliers deliver goods, materials, or services directly to Grasim and represent a significant share of our  procurement spend. Non-Tier 1 suppliers operate further upstream in the value chain, supplying products or services  through our Tier 1 partners. Supplier Onboarding Grasim follows a structured, transparent process for  supplier registration and onboarding. Prospective suppliers  are required to submit relevant documentation and  compliance declarations. Following an initial review, each  supplier undergoes a comprehensive evaluation based on  technical capabilities, financial health, certifications, past  performance, and alignment with our ESG commitments. Supplier ESG Programme We integrate ESG considerations into supplier screening  and evaluation process to align with our broader  sustainability goals. Information gathered during  registration is assessed through detailed desk reviews,  factoring in risks specific to the supplier’s geography,  sector, and product category. ESG performance accounts for 10% of the overall  evaluation score, in addition to key criteria such  as price, product quality, and delivery timelines.  Additionally, 5% is specifically allocated to  environmental responsibility, occupational health,  safety, and well-being. Suppliers demonstrating  stronger alignment with ESG standards are  prioritised during selection and contracting. Suppliers are expected to integrate our ESG principles into  their operations and maintain systems to monitor, audit,  and demonstrate compliance. Our purchasing practices  are periodically reviewed to ensure consistency with the  Supplier Code of Conduct and to prevent conflicts with ESG  expectations. If deviations occur, corrective action may be  taken with our support. Continued non-compliance may  result in disengagement.

Introduction and objective of  engagement Grasim Industries Limited (the ‘Company’) has developed  its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report  (‘BRSR’) including the BRSR Core Indicators 1 , based on  the BRSR reporting guidelines prescribed by SEBI for  listed entities. The reporting criteria have been derived  from the Principles of National Guidelines on Responsible  Business Conduct, 2018 (NGRBC), and Greenhouse Gas  (GHG) Protocol - A Corporate Accounting and Reporting  Standard. The Company has also developed its Integrated  Annual Report 2024-25 (‘IAR’) based on the principles of  the Integrated Reporting (<IR>) Framework published by  the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). The  BRSR would form a part of the IAR. BDO India LLP (BDO) was engaged by the Company to  provide independent assurance on select non-financial  sustainability disclosures in the BRSR and IAR (collectively,  the ‘Report’) for the period 1 st  April 2024 to 31 st  March 2025. The Company’s responsibilities The content of the Report and its presentation are the sole  responsibilities of the Management of the Company. The  Company’s Management is also responsible for the design,  implementation, and maintenance of internal controls  relevant to the preparation of the Report, so that it is free  from material misstatement. We used our professional judgement as Assurance Provider  for selection of sample of the Company’s locations/facilities  and non- financial information for the verifications. •   We conducted a review and verification of data  collection, collation, and calculation methodologies,  and a general review of the logic of inclusion/ omission  of relevant information/ data in the Report. Our review  process included: •   Evaluation and assessment of the appropriateness  of quantification methods used to arrive at the non- financial sustainability information of the BRSR Core  Indicators and IAR; •   Review of consistency of data/information within the  Report as well as between the Report and source; •   Engagement through discussions with personnel at both  corporate and plant/facility levels who are accountable  for the data and information presented in the Report; •   Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams,  to determine the level of accuracy in collection,  transcription, and aggregation; •   Review of data collection and management procedures,  and related internal controls. Limitations and exclusions: There are inherent limitations in an assurance  engagement, including, for example, the use of judgement  and selective testing of data. Accordingly, there are  possibilities that material misstatements in the Report may  remain undetected. The assurance scope excludes: •   Data and information outside the defined reporting  period (1 st  April 2024 to 31 st  March 2025) •   Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance  indicators’ included in the Report or on which reporting  is based; we have been informed by the Company  that these are derived from the Company’s audited  financial records; •   The Company’s statements and claims related to any  topic other than those listed in the ‘Scope & boundary  of assurance’; •   The Company’s statements that describe qualitative/ quantitative assertions, expression of opinion, belief,  inference, aspiration/targets, expectation, aim or  future intention. Our observations We have reviewed the disclosures in the Report for the  reporting period from 1 st  April 2024 through 31 st  March  2025. The disclosures of the Company, covered under the  ‘Scope and boundary of assurance’, are fairly reliable. Our Conclusions Based on the scope of our review, we concluded  the following: •   Reasonable Assurance of BRSR Core indicators:  The non-financial sustainability disclosures of the  BRSR Core indicators as mentioned in ‘Scope and  boundary of assurance’ reasonably fulfil the criteria  of relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and  understandability as per ‘reasonable’ assurance criteria; •   Limited Assurance of selected indicators for BRSR (other  than core) and IAR: Based on the procedures performed,  nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to  believe that the disclosures of the Company is presented  fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the  relevant reporting guidelines/standards.

In line with the government’s vision of creating Digital India  and empowering small and medium businesses, Birla Pivot  has created a new-age, high-growth e-commerce platform  that helps businesses with procurement of raw material  across various sectors and catalyzes their growth by  streamlining financing and supply chain gaps. Some of the key highlights for the year: •   Evolved our technology stack into a comprehensive  B2B E-commerce platform that is unique and solves the  needs of the ecosystem. The platform now powers a  220 Grasim Industries Limited 

catalog of more than 40,000 SKUs across 300+ brands  and OEMs in 35 product categories. Our proprietary  stack — Pivot Grid, Pivot Edge, Pivot Vault, and Pivot  XP — enables end-to-end B2B commerce across digital  procurement, credit-linked transactions, seamless  fulfillment, and marketplace selling.  •   Birla Pivot’s customer base spans top-tier EPC  companies, civil contractors, real estate developers,  OEMs, fabricators, dealers, and retailers. With successful  deliveries to over 375 cities across 26 States and Union  Territories, the unit has established a robust network of  suppliers and logistics providers who facilitate a very  seamless fulfillment experience.  •   The significant scale up in revenue is driven by new  customer acquisition and higher penetration amongst  existing buyers, driven by a superior OTIF (On-time and  In-full delivery) and seamless experience •   Our competitive pricing is driven by demand aggregation  across categories and strategic partnerships with OEMs  and regional brands. To further support ecosystem  efficiency, we offer customised, end-use-restricted  financing solutions that optimise working capital for  both buyers and sellers.  •   The business launched Birla Pivot Bathware in Q3FY25,  expanding the private label portfolio beyond Tiles  and Plywood. The focus now is to increase the reach  and distribution of these products across both Retail  and Projects. •   We launched custom credit and financing solutions that  are relevant for different buyer segments and sellers,  there by solving their working capital requirements.  •   In FY26, we will continue to strengthen our foundation  by scaling up our customer base, expanding credit  programmes, and accelerating digitisation. We will offer  more personalised solutions for buyers and sellers using  data and intelligence & helping them optimise their  overall procurement and project costs.  •   The aspiration for Birla Pivot is to reach $1 billion revenue in  the next two years, leveraging technology to create smarter  and more efficient solutions across the value chain. This  would be the first big milestone in our journey of building  the most trusted B2B E-commerce platform in the country.  Given the rapid evolution of small businesses (70 million+  growing at 13%) who are using the digital ecosystem for  business processes (GST, e-way bill generation, loans and  payments), Birla Pivot is well positioned to be the platform  that will drive the shift to B2B E-commerce and digital  adoption across all these sectors. Industry Context India’s building materials industry is undergoing exponential  growth and is projected to double to $ 200 billion in next  five years. With less than 2% digital penetration, this  sector faces many challenges - from fragmented supplier  networks, and logistical bottlenecks to access to credit. However, this remains one of the sectors that is yet to see  meaningful disruption or adoption of technology. Indian  B2B supply chain continues to operate in an inefficient,  fragmented, and localised manner with a lot of involvement  from intermediaries. There is a limited presence of large-scale  distributors or digital channels, and sourcing happens largely  offline. There is a huge opportunity to create a platform that  can manage end to end requirements for the customers - right  from demand prediction / sourcing to post delivery. The aspiration for Birla Pivot is to reach a $1 billion revenue  in the next two years, leveraging technology to create  smarter and more efficient solutions across the value  chain. This would be the first big milestone in our journey of  building the largest and the most trusted B2B E-commerce  platform in India. Given the rapid evolution of small businesses (70 million+  growing at 13%) who are using the digital ecosystem for  business processes (GST, e-way bill generation, loans and  payments), Birla Pivot is well positioned to be the platform  that will drive the shift to B2B E-commerce and digital  adoption across all these sectors.

To  support these goals, the Company develops a pipeline of  projects to address near and mid-term needs, as well as the  exploration of future opportunities. Business wise details are described hereunder: Cellulosic Staple Fibre  ( CSF ) The Cellulosic Staple Fibre (CSF) business continues  to strengthen its position as one of the world’s leading  producers of Manmade Cellulose Fibres (MMCF),  built on a foundation of sustainability, innovation, and  cost competitiveness. Our unwavering commitment to environmental  responsibility was once again recognised by Canopy, a  globally respected NGO. We retained our industry-leading  Dark Green Shirt  rating, reaffirming our leadership in  sustainable raw material sourcing and processing. A key milestone this year was the  commercial production  of Saxcell fibre , a breakthrough in chemical recycling  derived from pre-consumer textile waste. Alongside Liva  Reviva recycled viscose fibres, this achievement positions  us as  the only MMCF manufacturer globally offering both  recycled viscose and Lyocell fibres at commercial scale ,  reinforcing our leadership in the circular economy. In our pursuit of novel  Value-Added Products (VAPs) , we  achieved the first successful commercial production run of  Liva Intellicolour  fibre at our Nagda facility. The product is  now undergoing validation through downstream customer  testing. Our innovation pipeline also progressed on the flame- retardant front, with a successful large-scale production run  of  phosphate-based FR fibres , which have been distributed  to potential customers. Additionally, development of  silicate- based FR fibres  advanced with successful pilot trials. In our  Excel  fibre portfolio, we demonstrated a new  green chemistry process  at pilot scale for producing  Non-Fibleration / Low-Fibleration Excel. Commercial  implementation of this chemistry process is nearing  completion, with initial production runs already underway.  We also expanded our capability to produce  short-cut Excel  fibres  with ultra-low cut lengths, enabled by the development  of customised fibre-cutting hardware—broadening the  application potential of our fibres. Simultaneously, we  continued exploring  alternative sustainable feedstocks   for viscose and Lyocell production, which hold long-term  promise for improving pulp supply security. On the quality enhancement front, our process  development team introduced a new additive in the Excel  manufacturing process, which has significantly  improved  fibre abrasion resistance  without compromising other key  properties—resulting in an overall uplift in performance. We are also leveraging  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  and  Machine Learning (ML)  to transform our manufacturing  operations. Notably,  computer vision-enabled AIML  sensors  have been successfully deployed to detect spinning  faults in real time. This innovation has improved process  stability post-shutdown and is now being replicated across  other viscose and Excel lines. We also validated several  soft sensors and real-time optimisers  through proof-of- concept trials, particularly to enhance energy efficiency in  spin bath evaporation  and improve control of the viscose  slurry process. These interventions are driving higher  energy efficiency, process consistency, and ultimately,  superior fibre quality. A significant development on the raw material front was  the commissioning of a  pulp pilot plant at Harihar , focused  on testing cost-effective and sustainable pulp alternatives  derived from agri-residues, textile waste, veneer waste,  and more. The facility also enables optimisation of  pulping parameters and greener chemical processes.  Complementing this, we commissioned a  pulp treatment  station  to enhance pulp reactivity and solubility—further  strengthening our backward integration capabilities. To ensure ongoing excellence, we institutionalised a  fibre  benchmarking programme  across all manufacturing sites.  By systematically comparing our fibre properties with global  standards and competitors, we are generating actionable  insights to maintain and enhance our competitive edge. 230 Grasim Industries Limited 

As we look ahead, the CSF business remains steadfast in  its mission to drive  sustainable innovation , operational  excellence, and market leadership.

Board’s Report (Contd.) Aditya Birla Group: Executive  Remuneration Philosophy/Policy At the Aditya Birla Group, we expect our executive team to  foster a culture of growth and entrepreneurial risk-taking.  Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy supports  the design of programmes that align executive rewards  - including incentive programmes, retirement benefit  programmes, promotion and advancement opportunities  - with the long-term success of our stakeholders. Our Business and Organisational Model Our Group is a conglomerate and organised in a manner  such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure.  This results in uniformity of business processes and  systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary  customer experiences. I.     Objectives of the Executive Remuneration  Programme:     Our executive remuneration programme is designed  to attract, retain, and reward talented executives, who  will contribute to our long-term success, and thereby  build value for our shareholders.   Our executive remuneration programme is intended to:   1.     Pro vide for monetary and non-monetary  remuneration elements to our executives on a  holistic basis; and   2.     Emp hasise “Pay for Performance” by aligning  incentives with business strategies to reward  executives, who achieve or exceed the Group  business and individual goals. II.   Executives     Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy  applies to the following:   1.   Dir ectors of the Company;   2.     Key M anagerial Personnel: Chief Executive  Officer and equivalent e.g., Deputy Managing  Director, Chief Financial Officer and Company  Secretary; and   3.   Seni or Management. III.   Business and Talent Competitors     We benchmark our executive pay practices and  levels against peer companies in similar industries,  geographies and of similar size. In addition, we  look at secondary reference (internal and external)  benchmarks in order to ensure that the pay policies  and levels across the Group are broadly equitable  and support the Group’s global mobility objectives for  executive talent. Secondary reference points bring to  the table, the executive pay practices and pay levels  in other markets and industries, to appreciate the  differences in levels and medium of pay, and build in  as appropriate for decision-making. IV.   Executive Pay Positioning     We aim to provide competitive remuneration  opportunities to our executives by positioning target  total remuneration (including perks and benefits,  annual incentive pay-outs, long-term incentive pay  outs at target performance) and target the total  cash compensation (including annual incentive pay- outs) at target performance directionally between  median and top quartile of the primary talent market.  We recognise the size and scope of the role and the  market standing, skills and experience of incumbents  while positioning our executives.     We use secondary market data only as a reference  point for determining the types and amount of  remuneration while principally believing that the  target total remuneration packages should reflect the  typical cost of comparable executive talent available  in the sector. V.   Executive Pay-Mix     Our executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate  balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash  Compensation (Basic Salary+Allowances) (ii) Annual  Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks  and Benefits. Annexure ‘F’ to the Board’s Report Grasim Industries Limited, an Aditya Birla Group Company, has adopted the Executive  Remuneration Philosophy / Policy as applicable across the group companies.    This Philosophy/Policy is detailed below: 268 Grasim Industries Limited 

  Annual Incentive Plan:     We tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives  to the relevant financial and operational metrics  achievement, ESG performance and their individual  performance. We annually align the financial and  operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for  the business.   Long-Term Incentive:     Our long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch  performance, link executive remuneration to  sustained long-term growth and act as a retention  and reward tool.     We use stock options as the primary long-term  incentive vehicles for our executives as we believe  that they best align executive incentives with  stockholder interests.     We grant performance stock units as a secondary  long-term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain  our executives. VI.   Performance Goal Setting     We aim to ensure that, for both annual incentive plans  and long-term incentive plans, the target performance  goals shall be achievable and realistic.     Threshold performance (the point at which incentive  plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level)  shall reflect a base-line level of performance, reflecting  an estimated 90% probability of achievement.     Target performance is the expected level of  performance at the beginning of the performance  cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts  likely to impact measured performance.     Maximum performance (the point at which the  maximum plan pay-out is made) shall be based on an  exceptional level of achievement, reflecting no more  than an estimated 10% probability of achievement. VII.   Executive Benefits and Perquisites     Our executives are eligible to participate in our  broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and  other employee benefits plans. In addition to these  broad-based plans, they are eligible for perquisites  and benefits plans commensurate with their roles.  These benefits are designed to encourage long-term  careers with the Group.   Other Remuneration Elements:     Each of our executives is subject to an employment  agreement. Each such agreement generally  provides for a total remuneration package for our  executives, including continuity of service across the  Group Companies.     We limit other remuneration elements, for example,  Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance  agreements, to instances of compelling business  need or competitive rationale, and generally do not  provide for any tax gross-ups for our executives.

The performance evaluation of  Non-independent Directors and the Board as a whole was  carried out by the Independent Directors. The performance  of the Chairman of the Board was also reviewed, taking  into account the views of the Executive, Non-executive and  Independent Directors. The evaluation is based on criteria which includes,  among others, attendance and preparedness for the  meetings, participation in deliberations, understanding  the Company’s business and that of the industry and  guiding the Company in decisions affecting the business  and additionally based on the roles and responsibilities as  specified in Schedule IV of the Act. Structured questionnaires were circulated to the Directors  for providing feedback on functioning of the Board,  Committees and the Chairman of the Board. Based on the  inputs received, action plans are drawn up in consultation  with the Directors to encourage greater participation and  deliberations at the meetings and bringing to the table  their experience and guidance in further improving the  performance of your Company. The performance of the Independent Directors is evaluated,  with emphasis on: •   Time invested in understanding our Company and its  unique requirements; •   External knowledge and perspective; •   Views expressed on the issues discussed at the  Board; and •   Keeping updated on areas and issues that are likely to  be discussed at the Board. Remuneration Policy The Board has, on the recommendation of the NRC,  framed a policy on Remuneration of Directors and Senior  Management Personnels, which is available on the  Company’s website at  https://www.grasim.com/upload/ pdf/ABG-executive-remuneration-philosophy-policy. pdf . Performance Review System is primarily based on  competencies and values. The Company closely monitors  growth and development of top talent in the Company to  align personal aspiration with the organisation’s goal. Remuneration of Directors and Others Our Company’s executive remuneration philosophy  supports the design of programmes that align executive  rewards including incentive programmes, retirement benefit  programmes promotion and advancement opportunities,  with the long term success of our Company’s stakeholders. The executive remuneration policy is designed to attract,  retain, and reward talented executives who contribute to  our Company’s long-term success and thereby build value  292 Grasim Industries Limited 

for stakeholders. It is intended to provide for monetary and  non-monetary remuneration elements on a holistic basis;  emphasise “pay for performance” by aligning incentives  with business strategies to reward executives who achieve  or exceed business and individual goals. Executive pay practices and levels are dynamically tracked  and aligned with peer companies in similar industries,  geographies, size and function. Our Company aims to  provide competitive remuneration opportunities to its  executives by positioning target total remuneration  (including perks and benefits, annual incentive pay-outs,  long-term incentive payouts at target performance) and  target total cash compensation (including annual incentive  pay-outs) at target performance directionally between  median and top quartile of the primary talent market. It  recognises the size and scope of the role and the market  standing, skills and experience of incumbents while  positioning its executives. Our Company uses secondary  market data only as a reference point for determining  the types and amount of remuneration while principally  believing that target total remuneration packages should  reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent  available in the sector. The remuneration involves a balance between fixed and  incentive pay, reflecting short and long-term performance  objectives appropriate to the working of our Company  and its goals. A material proportion of compensation  for Senior Management is performance based - 25%  to 40% of compensation. It increases as the employee  grows in the organisation and takes up roles of higher  responsibility. The more senior the role, the weightage of  business performance on the variable pay also increases  in comparison to unit performance and individual  performance. This ensures a competitive pay-mix which  aims to strike the appropriate balance between key  components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary  + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term  Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits. Annual incentive plan pay-outs of executives are linked to  relevant financial and operational metrics achievement,  ESG performance and their individual performance.  Financial and operational metrics are annually aligned  with priorities / focus areas for the business. Long-term  incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link  executive remuneration to sustained long term growth  and act as a retention and reward tool. Stock options  are used as the primary long-term incentive vehicles  as our Company believes that they best align executive  incentives with stakeholder interests. Our Company also  grants performance stock units as a secondary long-term  incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain its executives.  The ratio of stock options and performance stock units is  generally 75:25. Our Company has integrated climate change and  sustainability targets in the key responsibility areas  (“KRAs”) of the Executive Director and Senior Management  Personnel. Thus, emission reduction targets and other  improvement targets related to climate change are also  linked with the incentives provided. Non-executive Directors’ Remuneration Based on the recommendation of the NRC Committee, all  decisions relating to remuneration of Directors are taken by  our Company’s Board in accordance with the shareholder’s  approval, wherever necessary. Sitting fees are paid as under: Board/Committee Sitting Fee Per  Meeting ( I ) Board 50,000/- Audit Committee and Rights Issue Committee  2023 25,000/- All other Committees 20,000/- In addition to the sitting fees, our Company also pays  commission to the Non-executive Directors of an  amount not exceeding 1% per annum of the net profit  of our Company. The amount of commission payable is  determined after assigning weightage to various factors,  which,  inter alia , include providing strategic perspective,  Chairmanship and contributions made by the Directors,  type of meeting and responsibilities under various statutes,  performance evaluation, etc. Based on the performance  evaluation of each Director and the remuneration policy,  the Board has recommended an amount of  I  250 lakh as  commission to be paid to the Non-executive Directors for  the financial year 2024-25. 293 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report      Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements      Consolidated Financial Statements

CSR Engagement The changing face of women Let me begin with, a spool back to a few lines, penned by  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the phenomenal poets of  nineteenth-century America, and I quote: “For it is the fate of a woman Long to be patient and silent To wait like a ghost that is speechless Till some questioning voice Dissolves the spell of its silence”. And look at where, we women stand today. Amazing how we in India, stand out on major counts. And most  certainly on women empowerment processes. The Government  in India is heavily invested, in the economic empowerment of  women, for over a decade now. This is an exciting trend. There is a genuine endeavour, across the globe, both at the  Government’s level, and equally so, in progressive corporates,  to recognise women. They have begun to reckon, that women  bring a lot to the table. Their creativity, out-of-the-box thinking,  their leadership, their resilience, and sensitivity, enable them to  make a definite impact. As this year rolled on, the Fortune 500 heralded a milestone:  For the first time in history, women ran more than 10% of the  businesses on the list of America’s largest public companies. In  effect, women run 10.4% of companies on the Fortune 500 this  year. So, it is happening, albeit a tad slow, but a beginning has  been made. In India, women representation on Boards, is 18 percent. What  is encouraging, is that consequent to the debate on Board  diversity in India, today, more than 40% of the companies have  gone beyond the mandated limit, and have appointed more than  one woman on the Board. In spite of the visible progress, at the global and national level,  that much remains to be done is indisputable. I venture to offer broad-based suggestions. Firstly, we need to  break the stereotyping of women, at two levels – personal and  the image that most men harbour. It’s high time that men stopped  making decisions for women – in other words, stopped ‘parenting’  and ‘mansplaining’ them. Truth be told, women who have risen  to a level, have proved to be equally capable, ambitious and  responsible. They manage their homes, and their children, along  with their work. Gender sensitivity and awareness discourses,  can drive home this aspect. Always look through a positive frame.  Men must play a proactive role of being an ally in fighting biases,  and obstacles at work, and in helping women break the glass  ceiling. A case in point is the insufficient access and financial  exclusion by Venture Capitalists – just 2 percent. We must alter  the algorithm. At the base level, most mothers need to shake off, the thought  that science, technology, engineering and mathematics are  good for boys and not for girls. So, the daughter is encouraged to  move in softer areas, devoid of technical skills. And this kind of  differential upbringing, becomes a roadblock and a self-limiting  belief. More recently, STEM education has been mainstreamed,  in the study programmes and that augurs well. There are two more points that I would like to highlight – first,  what are we doing as an MNC, operating in 41 countries, with  an employee base of 1,87,000+ employees, spanning 100  nationalities. And second, what is shaping, the empowerment  trajectory in our country. At the Aditya Birla Group, we have developed a playbook, fixated  on a holistic approach, that truly perpetuates women leaders. Our  endeavour is to make Aditya Birla Group, an aspirational workplace  for women, and increasingly weave women into mainstream  operations, in the near future. We have long begun enhancing the  representation of women at leadership levels, across operations,  be it management, manufacturing, marketing, branding, sales, or  research. We are making good progress. Currently, we have over  200 women, in senior and top leadership roles. For us it is a journey of transformation. Our Chairman has pushed  the agenda, and today it is like a movement. To drive a mindset of  inclusion, we have worked out diverse innovative programmes,  among which are immersive workshops, interactive manager  sensitisation and digital learning sessions. The outcomes have been very fulfilling. A clear signal is beamed -  emphasising the fact, that given everything being equal, the scale  must tilt towards women. In a few years ahead, we would be on  the top of the pole in the context of women empowerment. I am  sure, most progressive corporates, serious in pursuing gender  equity, would have made ‘women empowerment’ a business case. Moving next on to government initiatives to mentor women,  and leverage their potential, the Government of India, genuinely  believes that women led development is integral to India’s  progress. A slew of schemes that focus on education, healthcare,  financial inclusion, among others, have made a phenomenal  difference to the status of women, both in rural and urban areas. These relate to women-led entrepreneurship, property rights,  inheritance laws, ownership of wealth, besides education and  agriculture reforms. In a meticulous manner, these open the door,  to the journey of self-reliance and empowerment. It has helped  forge a self-actualisation path, for thousands of women. To cite  an example, there are over 8.59 lakh women Micro, Small and  Medium Enterprises registered. I believe, we can add up to over  18 percent to our nation’s GDP, which today stands at nearly 4  trillion dollars. Let me conclude in the words of our Honourable Prime Minister,  Shri Narendra Modiji: “Global development is not possible without  women’s participation”. We heed the message. What more can  one say!

Our forward march: A brief narrative of  our CSR engagement It might interest you to learn that Grasim is equally  committed to empower women. Today Grasim has a  cohort of 26 women leaders, 9.1 % of its management  staff comprises of women. The number of women in the  organisation has grown by 10 times in the last 10 years. Glimpses of our work in the developmental domains: SDG-1: To rid poverty across all nations by 2030 Our CSR engagement is pivoted on the enrichment of  the lives of the underprivileged. Our process comprises  of training and empowering them to become self-reliant  and lead lives of dignity and respect. It extends across our  17 manufacturing inclusive of Pulp & Fibre, Chemicals,  Insulators, Textiles and VFY units. These crisscross 9 states.  Among these feature Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat,  Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra,  Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. SDG-2: To end all forms of hunger and malnutrition  by 2030: To boost agricultural and horticultural activities and  improve overall farm productivity, we organised  213 camps  across Nagda, Veraval, Vilayat, Harihar, Rehla, Kalyan  and Rishra, consequently  4,179 farmers  have adopted  advanced agricultural practices. These camps focused on  doable interventions such as FPOs, Zero Budget Farming,  Nutritional Gardens, High value Crops, Drip & Sprinkler  irrigation, Orchard farms, Demonstration plots, soil  testing, distribution of quality seeds, training on advanced  agriculture methods & technology, inter-cropping  techniques, and exposure visits to agricultural universities. Additionally, in Nagda Madhya Pradesh, over  1,512 farmers  from the districts of Ujjain Nagda and Rehla Jharkhand  received quality seeds for Maize, Sorghum, Ragi, and  other millets as well 8 types of Green Fodder seeds for  Grasim Gokul Gaushala. 120 farmers engaged in Papaiya  cultivation. It enabled them cultivate  632 acres of land .  This initiative led to a  20% jump  in income. It also facilitated  linkage with the NABARD, KVK and Govt. Agriculture  Department, which enlarge market access considerably  for the farmers. Additionally, during agriculture support programmes held  in Nagda, Veraval, Rishra & Rehla we distributed agricultural  tools, fertilisers and crop protection material to around  522 farmers . These inputs were widely appreciated and  contributed to improved crop quality and yield. Three Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) were  successfully initiated at Nagda and Rishra, one FPO formed  exclusively for women at Nagda patched  1,478 farmers  together under a structured network to promote collective  growth and knowledge sharing.

We have established and now nurture two Grasim Gokul  Gaushalas at Nagda (MP) and Kharach (Gujarat) with 1,310  stray cows. A dedicated Cattle Development and Breeding Centre has  been set up at Nagda, Halol, Vilayat with BAIF. Its main  purpose is to offer doorstep artificial insemination (AI)  services and promote better cattle nutrition and health.  The activity has spawned 90 dairy farms. This year 4,740  cattle have been artificially inseminated and 2,298 calves  spawned across Nagda, Vilayat and Halol. The results have  been highly positive with a 100% success rate.

Energy  Consumption  and GHG  Emissions Risk Surging energy costs, supply  chain disruptions, and stringent  emission regulations pose  substantial risks, leading to  operational and financial  setbacks that affect profitability  and compliance with evolving  standards. Grasim is improving operations  by prioritising energy efficiency  and renewable energy adoption to  ensure continuity and transition to  a sustainable, low-carbon model.  Investments in energy-saving  technologies and renewables aim to  reduce emissions, lower costs, and  strengthen resilience while attracting  environmentally conscious investors.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (Contd.) S.  No. Material Issue  Identified Indicate  whether risk or  opportunity Rationale for identifying the risk/ opportunity In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity 2. Responsible  Supply Chain Risk Supply chain is a material area of  risk as expectations around ESG  accountability from customers  and regulators continue to  grow. Disruptions may arise  due to challenges in meeting  evolving legal requirements,  social or environmental concerns  at supplier sites, or sourcing  uncertainties. These can affect  continuity, increase operational  costs, and expose the business  to reputational and compliance- related pressures. Grasim has enhanced its supply chain  by adopting responsible sourcing  practices and sourcing from accredited  vendors. The Company favours local  suppliers, supporting community growth  and advancing sustainable practices,  reinforcing its environmental and social  responsibility. Negative 3. Climate  Change  Adaptation Risk The challenges of global  warming necessitate adaptive  measures that can significantly  impact Grasim’s operations.  Extreme weather events such  as floods, storms, and droughts  pose risks to supply chains,  infrastructure, and machinery,  leading to higher operational  costs. Anticipated regulatory  changes further increase the  risk of non-compliance, affecting  business continuity. While Grasim  is transitioning to a low-carbon  model and investing in green  technologies, climate change  remains a material risk with  implications for cost, compliance,  and operational resilience. Grasim recognised the risks posed by  climate change and has taken steps to  strengthen the resilience of its business  model. The Company has integrated  the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) into its risk  management framework to evaluate  physical and transition risks. It has also  secured insurance coverage to safeguard  against potential financial impacts from  climate-related events. Negative 4. Waste  Management Risk Inadequate waste management  poses significant risks to  Grasim, including environmental  degradation, regulatory non- compliance, and reputational  harm. Improper disposal can  lead to pollution, legal penalties,  and operational disruptions. As  environmental regulations tighten  and stakeholder expectations  increase, ineffective waste  practices may impact business  continuity and long-term  performance. Grasim is strengthening waste  management by minimising waste  generation and improving recycling  and disposal practices. It ensures  segregation at source, adopts circular  economy principles, and works with  authorised agencies in line with Central  and State Pollution Control Boards  directives. Investments in advanced  technologies and process improvements  support greater efficiency and help  mitigate environmental impact. Negative 5. Product  Stewardship Opportunity Product stewardship presents  an opportunity for Grasim to  deliver resource-efficient, socially  responsible products. Managing  the product life cycle, from design  to disposal, helps meet regulatory  expectations, build consumer  trust, and reduce environmental  impact - strengthening Grasim’s  position as a responsible brand. Grasim uses Life Cycle Assessment  to manage risks in manufacturing and  disposal. A closed-loop system enables  by-product reuse, improving efficiency  and reducing waste. Product safety is  ensured through secure handling and  transport, supporting environmental  protection and stakeholder trust. Positive 332 Grasim Industries Limited 

S.  No. Material Issue  Identified Indicate  whether risk or  opportunity Rationale for identifying the risk/ opportunity In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity 6. Human Rights Risk Human rights risks are relevant  to Grasim due to its extensive  supply chain and labour-intensive  operations. Disregarding human  rights standards can lead to  reputational damage, legal  consequences, and business  disruptions. Ensuring ethical  practices and respect for human  rights is critical to maintaining  operational continuity and  stakeholder confidence. Human rights risks are relevant to  Grasim due to its extensive supply  chain and labour-intensive operations.  Disregarding human rights standards  can lead to reputational damage, legal  consequences, and business disruptions.  Ensuring ethical practices and respect  for human rights is critical to maintaining  operational continuity and stakeholder  confidence. Negative 7. Water and  Effluents Risk A consistent and high-quality  water supply is essential for  uninterrupted operations at  Grasim. Water scarcity can disrupt  processes, increase raw material  costs, and raise health and safety  concerns for employees and  nearby residents. Competing for  water with local communities may  also affect the Company’s ability  to continue operating in certain  regions. Grasim is enhancing its water  management strategy through reduced  water consumption and increased  recycling. It continues to invest in new  technologies and upgrades to existing  systems. The installation of Zero Liquid  Discharge (ZLD) plants at manufacturing  sites is part of the Company’s ongoing  efforts to conserve water and reduce  dependency on freshwater sources. Negative 8. Innovation and  R&D Opportunity Innovation and R&D offer Grasim  the opportunity to enhance  its technological capabilities,  respond to evolving market needs,  and expand into new business  areas. These efforts also support  the development of sustainable  solutions, green technologies, and  resource-efficient practices that  contribute to long-term growth  and environmental progress. Grasim invests in R&D to remain  competitive and future-ready. Initiatives  include the development of resource- efficient solutions and the use of  Industry 4.0 technologies in the Paints  business for smart manufacturing. These  efforts enable growth, reduce emissions,  and support sustainable value creation. Positive 9. Resource  Efficiency Opportunity Resource efficiency is a key  opportunity for Grasim to optimise  the use of energy, water, and raw  materials across its operations.  Efficient resource management  supports better operational  performance, cost reduction,  and lower environmental  impact. It also aligns with  Grasim’s sustainability goals  and strengthens its competitive  position by promoting responsible  consumption. Resource efficiency presents a strategic  opportunity for Grasim to optimise  resource use, and lower operational  costs. The Company has set measurable  goals to enhance performance across  key resource areas, supporting lean  operations and sustainable growth.  These efforts also contribute to stronger  brand value and stakeholder confidence. Positive 10. Occupational  Health and  Safety Risk The nature of Grasim’s  manufacturing operations make  occupational health and safety  a key area of risk. Equipment  malfunction or human error,  especially in chemical handling,  can lead to safety concerns.  Continuous investment in training  and safer processes is essential  to maintaining a secure and well- managed work environment. Grasim is reinforcing workplace safety  through regular audits, awareness  programs, and customised training  modules. The adoption of SA 8000  standards has strengthened its  safety framework and employee well- being efforts. The Company has also  established ‘Life Saving Rules’ and  role-based training to ensure consistent  safety practices. Insurance coverage is in  place to support employees in the event  of workplace incidents.

To support these safety initiatives, Grasim has developed a substantial infrastructure for occupational health  assessments, with continuous monitoring of work environments and well-equipped medical facilities available to all  employees. New hires, including contract workers and security staff, are required to participate in safety induction  sessions to familiarise them with the Company’s safety procedures.     The Company’s operational safety standards are rigorous, with protocols such as the Permit to Work system addressing  Confined Spaces, Hot Work, Machine Guarding, Working at Height, Electrical Safety, Management of Change, and  Process Safety Management. These standards are reinforced by plant-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs)  in each business unit, which are regularly audited internally and externally to ensure compliance with Occupational  Safety Parameters.     Grasim’s commitment to safety is further demonstrated by its adherence to ABG sustainability guidelines and the  requirements of ISO 45001 and SA 8000. A structured Kaizen program encourages all levels of employees to submit  safety-related improvements, while central and departmental safety committees carry out routine safety audits.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (Contd.) 8.   Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.   Optimising Exhaust Blower Speed for Energy Efficiency:     To improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions in the Spin Bath calcination process, we optimised the operation of  the exhaust blower, which previously ran continuously at high speed. A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) was installed  to regulate blower speed based on actual process needs. This adjustment reduced energy consumption by 49,625  kWh annually, lowered salt particle emissions, and enhanced drying performance by increasing hot air retention.  The initiative not only improved process stability but also supported our broader sustainability goals by aligning  operations with environmental best practices.   Other Initiatives:      Multiple initiatives were undertaken to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions across operations.  LPG consumption was optimised through process improvements such as fan efficiency enhancement and use  of low - specific-heat refractory materials achieved without capital investment. Compressed air systems were  restructured by introducing pressure segregation and replacing old compressors with energy-efficient, VFD-enabled  two-stage units, resulting in reduced power consumption and header losses.

To the Members of  Grasim Industries Limited Report on the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the standalone financial statements  of Grasim Industries Limited (“the Company”) and its  Employee Welfare Trust (“Trust”) which comprise the  standalone balance sheet as at 31 st  March 2025, and the  standalone statement of profit and loss (including other  comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes  in equity and standalone statement of cash flows for the  year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial  statements, including material accounting policies and  other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as  “standalone financial statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, and based on the  consideration of report of one of the joint auditors of the  Company on standalone financial statements of such Trust  as were audited by one of the joint auditors of the Company,  the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the  information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the  manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity  with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of  the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 st  March 2025, and  its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and  its cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section  143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs  are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities  for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements  section of our report. We are independent of the  Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  together with the ethical requirements that are relevant  to our audit of the standalone financial statements  under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder,  and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with these requirements and the Code of  Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by  us along with the consideration of report of one of the  joint auditors of the Company referred to in the “Other  Matters” section below, is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone  financial statements. Key Audit Matter Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgement, were of most significance  in our audit of the standalone financial statements of  the current period. These matters were addressed in  the context of our audit of the standalone financial  statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  these matters. Assessment of Impairment of Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit As disclosed in Note 2.4 of standalone financial statements,  the Company has investments in subsidiaries, associates  and joint venture companies of  H   23,155.11 crore (P.Y –  H   23,168.85 crore). The said investments are carried at cost  less allowance for impairment. The Company analyses indicators of impairment of the  said investments by reference to the requirements under  relevant Ind AS. Our audit procedures included the following: •    Assessed the Company’s accounting policy for  impairment of investments in subsidiaries, associates  and joint ventures with applicable accounting standards. •     Tested the design and operating effectiveness of  key internal financial controls over the impairment  assessment process, including the approval of forecasts  and valuation models in subsidiaries, associates and  joint ventures. Independent Auditor’s Report 376 Grasim Industries Limited 

Assessment of Impairment of Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit We identified the annual impairment assessment as a  significant risk because carrying value of these investments  is significant, assessment process is complex, judgemental  by nature, significant changes in business environment and  further based on the inherent subjectivity, uncertainty and  judgement involved in the following key assumptions: •   projected future cash inflows; •   expected growth rate; •   discount ra te; •   terminal growth rate; Refer Note 1.30 – Material accounting policy for impairment  of investments and Note 3.10 on Exceptional Items. •     Examined the Company’s assessment for indicators of  impairment of such investments. In cases where such  indicators existed, tested the estimates and assumption  made by the Company of the recoverable amounts, and  the allowance for impairment for these investments,  where applicable. •    We challenged the key assumptions used by  management in developing the forecasts by applying  sensitivities and evaluating plausible downside  scenarios, where applicable. •     Evaluated competence, capabilities and independence  of the specialist engaged by the Company and analysed  the valuation reports issued by such specialist, where  applicable. •     Involved our internal valuation expert to assist in  evaluating the key assumptions and methodology of the  valuations, where applicable. •     Tested the arithmetical accuracy of the computation of  recoverable amounts of investments. •     Evaluated past performance where relevant and  assessed historical accuracy of the forecast produced  by management. Other Information The Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the other information. The other  information comprises the information included in the  Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial  statements and auditor’s report thereon. The Company’s  annual report is expected to be made available to us after  the date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does  not cover the other information and we will not express any  form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information identified above when it becomes available  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information  is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial  statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read the Company’s annual report, if we conclude  that there is a material misstatement therein, we are  required to communicate the matter to those charged  with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable  under the relevant laws and regulations. Management’s and Board of Directors’/  Trustees’ Responsibilities for the  Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the  Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone  financial statements that give a true and fair view of the  state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive  income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company  in accordance with the accounting principles generally  accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the  Act.

of the Company/Trustees of the Trust are responsible  for maintenance of adequate accounting records in  accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding  of the assets of Company/Trust and for preventing and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgements and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls, that were operating  effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation  and presentation of the standalone financial statements  that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, the  respective Management and Board of Directors/Trustees  are responsible for assessing the ability of the Company/ Trust to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless the respective  Board of Directors/Trustees either intends to liquidate the  Company/Trust or to cease operations, or has no realistic  alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors/ Trustees of the Trust are  responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process  of the Company/Trust. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit  of the Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the standalone financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes  our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: •     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the standalone financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or  the override of internal control. •     Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section  143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for  expressing our opinion on whether the Company has  adequate internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. •     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by the Management and  Board of Directors. •     Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis  of accounting in preparation of standalone financial  statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If  we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we  are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report  to the related disclosures in the standalone financial  statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to  modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the  audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may cause  the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. •     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the standalone financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the standalone  financial statements represent the underlying  transactions and events in a manner that achieves  fair presentation. •     Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding  the financial statements of the Trust of the Company  to express an opinion on the standalone financial  statements. For the Trust included in the standalone  financial statements, which have been audited by one  of the joint auditors of the Company, such one of the  Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.) 378 Grasim Industries Limited 

joint auditors of the Company, remain responsible  for the direction, supervision and performance of  the audit carried out by them. We remain solely  responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities  in this regard are further described in the section  titled “Other Matters” in this audit report. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that we  identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of  most significance in the audit of the standalone financial  statements of the current period and are therefore the key  audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s  report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure  about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,  we determine that a matter should not be communicated  in our report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public  interest benefits of such communication. Other Matters The standalone annual financial statements include the  audited financial statements of one trust whose financial  statements reflects total assets (before consolidation  adjustments) of  H   309.84 crore as at 31 st  March 2025, total  revenue (before consolidation adjustments) of  H   Nil crore,  total net profit after tax (before consolidation adjustments)  of  H   1.30 crore and net cash inflows (before consolidation  adjustments) of  H   0.14 crore for the year ended on that  date, as considered in the standalone financial statements,  which has been audited by one of the joint auditors of  the Company.

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,  adequate internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements and such internal financial  controls were operating effectively as at 31 st  March 2025,  based on the internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements criteria established by the  Company considering the essential components of such  internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India    (“the Guidance Note”). Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for Internal Financial  Controls The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors  are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal  financial controls based on the internal financial controls  with reference to standalone financial statements criteria  established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note.  These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly  and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and  the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as  required under the Act. To the Independent Auditor’s Report on the standalone financial statements of Grasim Industries Limited for    the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements based on our audit. We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note  and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section  143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of  internal financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance  Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and  plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether adequate internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements were  established and maintained and if such controls operated  effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial statements  and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal  financial controls with reference to standalone financial  statements included obtaining an understanding of  internal financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based on  the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on  the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the  risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls  with Reference to Standalone Financial  Statements A Company’s internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements is a process designed  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles.    Annexure B 390 Grasim Industries Limited 

A Company’s internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance  that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of standalone financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the Company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations  of management and directors of the Company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or  disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a  material effect on the standalone financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal  Financial Controls with Reference to  Standalone Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial statements,  including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements  due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also,  projections of any evaluation of the internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial statements  to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial controls with reference to standalone financial  statements may become inadequate because of changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the  policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of Preparation:     These financial statements are prepared and  presented in accordance with the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  amended from time to time as notified under Section  133 of the Companies Act, 2013, the relevant  provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and  the guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange  Board of India (SEBI), as applicable. The accounting  policies have been consistently applied for all the  periods presented in the financial statements.     The financial statements have been prepared and  presented on the going concern basis and at historical  cost, except for the following assets and liabilities,  which have been measured as indicated below: •   Derivative Financial Instruments at fair value  (covered under para 1.17) •   Certain financial assets and liabilities at fair  value [refer accounting policy regarding financial  instruments (covered under para 1.19)] •   Assets held for disposal - measured at the lower of  its carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell •   Employee’s Defined Benefit Plan measured as per  actuarial valuation •   Employee Stock Option Plans measured at fair  value and •   Assets and Liabilities acquired under Business  Combination measured at fair value.   Functional and Presentation Currency:     The financial statements are presented in Indian  Rupees, which is the functional currency of the  Company and the currency of the primary economic  environment in which the Company operates, and  all values are rounded to the nearest crore, up to 2  decimal places, except as otherwise indicated. B.   Material Accounting Policies: 1.1     Business Combination and Goodwill/ Capital  Reserve:     The Company uses the acquisition method of  accounting to account for business combinations.  The acquisition date is the date on which control is  transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in  determining the acquisition date and determining  whether control is transferred from one party to  another. Control exists when the Company is exposed  to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement  with the entity and has the ability to affect those  returns through power over the entity. In assessing  control, potential voting rights are considered only if  the rights are substantive.     Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess  of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over  the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities  assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is  in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred,  the Company re-assesses whether it has correctly  identified all of the assets acquired and all of the  liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used  to measure the amounts to be recognised at the  acquisition date. If the re-assessment still results in an  excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the  aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain  is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)  and accumulated in other equity as capital reserve.  However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain  purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in  other equity as capital reserve, without routing the  same through OCI.     Consideration transferred includes the fair values  of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the  Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and  equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration  transferred also includes the fair value of any  contingent consideration. Consideration transferred  does not include amounts related to the settlement  of pre-existing relationships. Any goodwill that arises  on account of such business combination is tested  annually for impairment. 400 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Any contingent consideration is measured at fair  value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay  contingent consideration that meets the definition  of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it  is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted  for within other equity. Otherwise, other contingent  consideration is re-measured at fair value at each  reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair  value of the contingent consideration are recorded in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.     A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed  in a business combination only if such a liability  represents a present obligation and arises from a past  event, and its fair value can be measured reliably. On  an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company  recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree  either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s  proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable  net assets. Transaction costs that the Company  incurs in connection with a business combination,  such as Stamp Duty for title transfer in the name of  the Company, finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence  fees and other professional and consulting fees, are  expensed as incurred and the services are received. 1.2     Classification of Assets and Liabilities as Current  and Non-Current:     All assets and liabilities are classified as current or  non-current as per the Company’s normal operating  cycle, Ind AS-1 and other criteria set out in the Division  II of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. Based  on the nature of products and the time lag between  the acquisition of assets for processing and their  realisation in cash and cash equivalents, 12-month  period has been considered by the Company as its  normal operating cycle. 1.3   Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):     On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to  continue with the carrying value of all its property,  plant and equipment recognised as at 1 st  April 2015,  measured as per the previous GAAP and use that  carrying value as the deemed cost of the property,  plant and equipment.     Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition  or construction cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment loss. Freehold land is  stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses,  if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any  attributable cost of bringing the asset to its location  and working condition for its intended use, including  relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of  de-commissioning.     If significant parts of an item of PPE have different  useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate  items (major components) of PPE.     The cost of an item of PPE is recognised as an asset if,  and only if, it is probable that the economic benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Company  in future periods and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably. Expenditure incurred after the  PPE have been put into operations, such as repairs  and maintenance expenses, are charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss during the year in which  they are incurred.     Items such as spare parts, standby equipment and  servicing equipment are recognised as PPE when  these are held for use in the production or supply  of goods or services, or for administrative purpose,  and are expected to be used for more than one year.  Otherwise, such items are classified as inventory.     An item of PPE is de-recognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected to  arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain  or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item  of PPE, is determined as the difference between the  sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset,  and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     Capital work-in-progress includes cost of property,  plant and equipment under installation/under  development as at the reporting date. 1.4     Treatment of Expenditure during Construction  Period:     Expenditure, net of income earned, during construction  (including financing cost related to borrowed funds for  construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) period is  included under capital work-in-progress, and the same  is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion  of construction. Advances given towards acquisition  or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting  date are disclosed as Capital Advances under “Other  Non-Current Assets”. 1.5   Depreciation:     Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the  depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life and  401 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 is provided on a straight-line basis, except for Viscose Staple Fibre Division (excluding Power Plants), Nagda, and  Corporate Finance Division, Mumbai for which it is provided on written down value method, over the useful lives as  prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, or as per technical assessment.     Depreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over  which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Company, or the number of production or similar units expected  to be obtained from the asset by the Company.     Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.     Improvements undertaken over the leasehold properties are depreciated over the earlier of the useful life of the asset  or the end of the lease term.     The Company has used the following useful lives of the property, plant and equipment to provide depreciation.   A.     Major assets class where useful life considered as provided in Schedule II: S.  No. Nature of the Assets Estimated Useful  Life of the Assets 1. Plant and Machinery - Continuous Process Plant 25 years 2. Reactors 3 years 3. Vessel / Storage Tanks 20 years 4. Factory Buildings 30 years 5. Buildings (other than Factory Buildings) RCC Frame Structure 60 years 6. Electric Installations and Equipment (at Factory) 10 years 7. Computer and other Hardware 3 years 8. General Laboratory Equipment 10 years 9. Railway Sidings 15 years 10. Carpeted Roads- Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) Carpeted Roads- other than RCC Non-Carpeted Roads 10 years 5 years 3 years 11. Fences, wells, tube wells 5 years       In cas e of certain class of assets, the Company uses different useful life than those prescribed in Schedule II  of the Companies Act, 2013. The useful life has been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account  the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of the management’s best estimation of  getting economic benefits from those classes of assets. The Company uses its technical expertise along with  historical and industry trends for arriving at the economic life of an asset.       Als o, useful life of the part of PPE which is significant to the total cost of PPE, has been separately assessed and  depreciation has been provided accordingly.   B.     Assets where useful life differs from Schedule II: S.  No. Nature of the Assets Useful Life as Prescribed  by Schedule II of the  Companies Act, 2013 Estimated Useful Life of  the Assets 1. Plant and Machinery (Other than Continuous Process Plant) 7.5-15 years 7.5-20 years 2. Motor Vehicles  6-10 years 4-5 years 3. Electronic Office Equipment 5 years 4 years 4. Furniture, Fixtures and Electrical Fittings 10 years 5-7 years 5. Buildings (other than Factory Buildings) other than RCC    Frame Structures 30 years 60 years 6. Power Plant 40 years 25 years 7. Servers and Networks 6 years 3 years 8. Spares in the nature of PPE 10 years 9.

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     The estimated useful lives, residual values and the  depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each  reporting period, with the effect of any changes in  estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.     Continuous process plant, as defined in Schedule II  of the Companies Act, 2013, have been classified on  the basis of technical assessment and depreciation is  provided accordingly.     Depreciation on additions is provided on a pro- rata basis from the month of installation or  acquisition, and in case of a new Project, from the  date of commencement of commercial production.  Depreciation on deductions/disposals is provided on  a pro-rata basis up to the month preceding the month  of deduction/disposal. 1.6     Intangible Assets acquired separately and  Amortisation:     On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to  continue with the carrying value of all its Intangible  Assets recognised as at 1 st  April 2015, measured as  per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as  the deemed cost of the Intangible Assets.     Intangible assets, acquired separately, are measured  on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible  assets acquired in a business combination is their  fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial  recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less  any accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any.     Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over  the useful economic life and assessed for impairment  whenever there is an indication that the intangible  asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and  the amortisation method for an intangible asset with  a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end  of each reporting period. Changes in the expected  useful life or the expected pattern of consumption  of future economic benefits embodied in the asset  are considered to modify the amortisation period or  method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes  in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense  on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such  expenditure forms part of carrying value of another  asset. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives.     Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not  amortised, but are tested for impairment annually,  either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.  The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually  to determine whether the indefinite life continues to  be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from  indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.     Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an  intangible asset are measured as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying  amount of the asset and are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is de- recognised.   Intangible Assets and their useful lives are as under: S.  No. Nature of the Assets Estimated Useful  Life of the Assets 1. Computer Software 3 years 2. Trademarks, Technical Know-how 10 years 3. Value of License/Right to use infrastructure 10 years 4. Customer Relationship 15-25 years 5. Brands 10 years 6. Distribution Network 5-25 years 7. Right to Manage and Operate Manufacturing Facility 15 years 8. Non-compete fees 3 years 9.

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 1.7     Internally Generated Intangible Assets - Research  and Development Expenditure:     Revenue expenditure on research is expensed under  the respective heads of the account in the period  in which it is incurred. Development expenditure is  capitalised as an asset, if the following conditions can  be demonstrated:   a)     The technical feasibility of completing the asset  so that it can be made available for use or sell.   b)     The C ompany has intention to complete the  asset and use or sell it.   c)     In ca se of intention to sell, the Company has the  ability to sell the asset.   d)   The future economic benefits are probable.   e)     The C ompany has ability to measure the  expenditure attributable to the asset during its  development reliably.     Other development costs, which do not meet the  above criteria, are expensed out during the period in  which they are incurred.     PPE procured for research and development activities  are capitalised. 1.8     Discontinued operations and non-current assets  held for sale:     Discontinued operation is a component of the  Company that has been disposed of or classified as  held for sale and represents a major line of business.     Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified  as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to  be recovered principally through a sale (rather than  through continuing use) when the asset (or disposal  group) is available for immediate sale in its present  condition subject only to terms that are usual and  customary for sale of such asset (or disposal group)  and the sale is highly probable and is expected to  qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one  year from the date of classification.     Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as  held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying  amount and fair value less costs to sell. 1.9   Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:     At the end of each reporting period, the Company  reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets  to determine whether there is any indication that  those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any  such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the  asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of  the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible  to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual  asset, the Company estimates the recoverable  amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset  belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of  allocation can be identified, corporate assets are  also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or  otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group  of cash-generating units, for which a reasonable and  consistent allocation basis can be identified.     Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and  intangible assets not yet available for use are tested  for impairment at least annually, and whenever there  is an indication then the asset may be impaired.     Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less  costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing  the value in use, the estimated future cash flows  are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset, for which the estimates of future  cash flows have not been adjusted.     If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying  amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash- generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the  Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the relevant asset  is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the  impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.     When an impairment loss subsequently reverses,  the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash- generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate  of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased  carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount  that would have been determined had no impairment  loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating  unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is  recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and  Loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued  amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment  loss is treated as a revaluation increase. 404 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 1.10   Inventories:     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realisable value, on item-by-item basis.     Net realisable value for inventories is the estimated  selling price in the ordinary course of business, less  estimated costs of completion and the estimated  costs necessary to make the sale.     Raw materials, stores and spare parts, and packing  materials are considered to be realisable at cost,  if the finished products, in which they will be used,  are expected to be sold at or above cost. The cost is  computed on weighted-average basis, which includes  expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like  purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit)  and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition.     Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress includes  the cost of conversion based on normal capacity and  other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition. Cost of stock- in-trade includes cost of purchase and other costs  incurred in bringing the inventories to the present  location and condition. The cost of finished goods,  work-in-progress and stock-in-trade is computed on  weighted-average basis.     In the absence of cost, waste/scrap is valued at  estimated net realisable value.     Obsolete, defective, slow moving and unserviceable  inventories, if any, are duly provided for.     Proceeds in respect of sale of raw materials/stores are  credited to the respective heads. 1.11   Cash and Cash Equivalents:     Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise cash on hand  and cash at banks, including fixed deposits with  original maturity period of three months or less and  short-term highly liquid investments with an original  maturity of three months or less. 1.12   Cash Flow Statement:     Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby the net profit before tax is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any  deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash  receipts or payments and item of income or expenses  associated with investing or financing cash flows. The  cash flows from operating, investing and financing  activities of the Company are segregated. 1.13   Employee Benefits:     Short-Term Employee Benefits:     Short-term employee benefits are recognised as an  expense on accrual basis.    Defined Contribution Plans:     Contribution payable to the recognised provident  fund and approved superannuation scheme, which are  substantially defined contribution plans, is recognised  as expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss, when  employees have rendered the service entitling them  to the contribution.     The provident fund contribution as specified  under the law is paid to the Regional Provident  Fund Commissioner.    Defined Benefit Plans:     The obligation in respect of defined benefit plans,  which covers Gratuity, Pension and other post- employment medical benefits, are provided for on  the basis of an actuarial valuation at the end of each  financial year using projected unit credit method.  Gratuity is funded with an approved trust.     In respect of certain employees, Provident Fund  contributions are made to a Trust, administered by the  Company. The interest rate payable to the members  of the Trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate  of interest declared by the Central Government under  the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous  Provisions Act, 1952, and shortfall, if any, shall be  made good by the Company. The Company’s liability  is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit  Credit Method) at the end of the year, and any shortfall  in the Fund size maintained by the Trust set-up by the  Company is additionally provided for.     Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and  losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling  (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding  net interest), is reflected immediately in the Balance  Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income in the period in which  they occur. 405 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Re-measurement recognised in Other Comprehensive  Income is reflected immediately in retained earnings  and will not be reclassified to profit or loss in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. Defined benefit costs  are categorised as follows: •   service cost (including current service cost,  past service cost, as well as gains and losses on  curtailments and settlements); •   net interest expense or income; and •   re-measurement.     The Company presents the first two components of  defined benefit costs in the Statement of Profit and  Loss in the line item ‘Employee Benefits Expense’.     The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan  liability is calculated using a discount rate, which is  determined by reference to market yields at the end  of the reporting period on government bonds.     The retirement benefit obligation, recognised in the  Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus  in the Company’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus  resulting from this calculation is limited to the present  value of any economic benefits available in the form  of refunds from the plans or reductions in the future  contribution to the plans.   Compensated Absences:     The Compensated Absences cover the Company’s  liability for earned and sick leaves. The compensated  absences are provided for on the basis of an actuarial  valuation at the end of each financial year. Total  liability related to this is presented as current, since  the Company does not have an unconditional right to  defer its settlement.     Actuarial gains/losses, if any, are recognised  immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 1.14   Employee Share Based Payments:   Equity-settled Transactions:     Equity-settled share-based payments to employees  are measured by reference to the fair value of the  equity instruments at the grant date using Black- Scholes Model and Binomial Model.     The fair value, determined at the grant date of the  equity-settled share-based payments, is charged  to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic  basis over the vesting period of the option, based on  the Company’s estimate of equity instruments that  will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in  other equity.     In case of forfeiture/lapse stock option, which is not  vested, amortised portion is reversed by credit to  employee compensation expense. In a situation where  the stock option expires unexercised, the related  balance standing to the credit of the Employee Stock  Options Outstanding Account is transferred within  other equity.   Cash-settled Transactions:     The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured  initially at fair value at the grant date using a Black- Scholes Merton Formula. This fair value is expensed  over the period until the vesting date with recognition  of a corresponding liability. The liability is re-measured  to fair value at each reporting date up to, and including  the settlement date, with changes in fair value  recognised in employee benefits expense. 1.15   Treasury Shares:     The Company has created an Employee Benefit  Trust (EBT) for providing share-based payment to its  employees. The Company uses EBT as a vehicle for  distributing shares to employees under the Employee  Stock Option Scheme. The EBT purchase shares of  the Company from the market, for giving shares to  employees. The Company treats EBT as its extension  and shares held by EBT are treated as treasury shares.     Own equity instruments that are re-acquired (treasury  shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from  other equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss on the purchase, sale,  issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity  instruments. Share options whenever exercised,  would be settled from such treasury shares. 1.16   Foreign Currency Transactions:     In preparing the financial statements of the Company,  transactions in foreign currencies, other than the  Company’s functional currency, are recognised at  the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the  transactions. At the end of each reporting period,  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at  that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in  406 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not  re-translated.     Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the  period in which these arise, except for: •   exchange differences on foreign currency  borrowings relating to assets under construction  for future productive use, which are included in  the cost of those assets when they are regarded  as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign  currency borrowings; and •   exchange differences relating to qualifying  effective cash flow hedges. 1.17    Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge  Accounting:     The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge  the foreign currency risk of firm commitments and  highly probable forecast transactions. Derivatives  are initially recognised at fair value at the date  the derivative contracts are entered into and are  subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the  end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or  loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  immediately, unless the derivative is designated and  effective as a hedging instrument, in which event  the timing of the recognition in the Statement of  Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedging  relationship and the nature of the hedged item.     The Company enters into derivative financial  instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts,  interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to  manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange  rate risks and commodity prices. The Company  does not hold derivative financial instruments for  speculative purposes.   Hedge Accounting:     The Company designates certain hedging instruments  in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk  and commodity price risk as cash flow hedges. At  the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company  formally designates and documents the hedge  relationship to which the Company wishes to  apply hedge accounting and the risk management  objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.  The documentation includes the Company’s risk  management objective and strategy for undertaking  hedge, the hedging/ economic relationship, the  hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk  being hedged, hedge ratio and how the entity will  assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging  instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to  changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows  attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are  expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting  changes in fair value or cash flows, and are assessed  on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually  have been highly effective throughout the financial  reporting periods for which they were designated.     The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the  designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash  flow hedges is recognised in Other Comprehensive  Income and accumulated under the heading of cash  flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the  ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.     Amounts previously recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income and accumulated in other  equity relating to (effective portion as described  above) are re-classified to the Statement of Profit  and Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects  profit or loss. However, when the hedged forecast  transaction results in the recognition of a non- financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains  and losses are transferred from equity and included  in the initial measurement of the cost of the non- financial asset or non-financial liability.     Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised,  without replacement or rollover (as part of the hedging  strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked,  or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  Any gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive  Income and accumulated in other equity at that  time remains in other equity and is recognised when  the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecast  transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain  or loss accumulated in other equity is recognised  immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 1.18   Fair Value Measurement:     The Company measures financial instruments, such  as investments (other than equity investments in  Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates) and  derivatives at fair values at each Balance Sheet date. 407 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. The fair value measurement is  based on the presumption that the transaction to sell  the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:     In the principal market for the asset or liability, or     In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability.     The principal or the most advantageous market must  be accessible by the Company.     The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured  using the assumptions that market participants  would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming  that market participants act in their economic  best interest.     A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset  takes into account a market participant’s ability to  generate economic benefits by using the asset in its  highest and best use, or by selling it to another market  participant that would use the asset in its highest and  best use.     The Company uses valuation techniques that are  appropriate in the circumstances and for which  sufficient data are available to measure fair value,  maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and  minimising the use of unobservable inputs.     All assets and liabilities (for which fair value is  measured or disclosed in the financial statements) are  categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described  as follows, based on the lowest level input that is  significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:     Level 1 —  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities.     Level 2 —  Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is directly or indirectly observable other  than quoted prices included in Level 1.     Level 3 —  Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is unobservable.     For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the  financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company  determines whether transfers have occurred between  levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation  (based on the lowest level input that is significant to  the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period.     The management determines the policies and  procedures for both recurring fair value measurement,  such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial  assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring  measurement, such as assets held for disposal in  discontinued operations.     At each reporting date, the management analyses  the movements in the values of assets and liabilities,  which are required to be re-measured or re-assessed  as per the Company’s accounting policies. For this  analysis, the management verifies the major inputs  applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the  information in the valuation computation to contracts  and other relevant documents. 1.19   Financial Instruments:     A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise  to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability  or equity instrument of another entity.   Financial Assets:   Initial Recognition and Measurement     All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value.  However, in the case of financial assets not recorded  at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs  that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial  asset are added to the fair value. However, trade  receivables that do not contain a significant financing  component are measured at transaction price (net of  variable consideration). Purchases or sales of financial  assets that require delivery of assets within a time  frame established by regulation or convention in the  market place (regular way trades) are recognised  on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company  commits to purchase or sell the asset.   Subsequent Measurement     For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial  assets are classified in four categories: 408 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 •   Debt instruments at amortised cost •   Debt instruments at fair value through Other  Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) •   Debt instruments, derivatives and equity  instruments, mutual funds at fair value through  profit or loss (FVTPL) •   Equity instruments measured at fair value through  other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)   Debt Instruments at Amortised Cost:     A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost,  if both the following conditions are met:   a)     The  asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for collecting  contractual cash flows, and   b)     Con tractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the  principal amount outstanding.     After initial measurement, such financial assets are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost  is calculated by taking into account any discount or  premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are  an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is  included in finance income in the profit or loss. The  losses arising from impairment are recognised in the  profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade  and other receivables.   Debt Instrument at FVTOCI:     A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI, if  both of the following criteria are met:   a)     The objective of the business model is achieved  both by collecting contractual cash flows and  selling the financial assets, and   b)     The asset’s contractual cash flows represent  SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.     Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI  category are measured initially as well as at each  reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are  recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI).  However, the Company recognises interest income,  impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange  gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On  de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss  previously recognised in OCI is re-classified from the  equity to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest  earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is  reported as interest income using the EIR method.   Debt Instrument at FVTPL:     FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any  debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for  categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is  classified as at FVTPL.     In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt  instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or  FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election  is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a  measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred  to as ‘Accounting Mismatch’).     Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category  are measured at fair value with all changes recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     Interest Income from these financial assets are  recognised is included in Other Income in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.   Equity Instruments:     Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint  Ventures are out of scope of Ind AS 109 and hence,  the Company has accounted for its investment in  Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures at cost.     All other equity investments are measured at fair value.  Equity instruments which are held for trading are  classified as at FVTPL. For equity instruments other  than held for trading, the Company has irrevocable  option to present in Other Comprehensive Income  subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company  makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument  basis. The classification is made on initial recognition  and is irrevocable.     Where the Company classifies equity instruments  as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the  instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in  the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts of profit  or loss from OCI to the Statement of Profit and Loss,  even on sale of investment. 409 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category  are measured at fair value with all changes recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   Impairment of Financial Assets:     Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are  assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of  each reporting period. In case of financial assets, the  Company follows the simplified approach permitted  by Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments – for recognition  of impairment loss allowance. The application of  simplified approach does not require the Company  to track changes in credit risk of trade receivable.  The Company calculates the expected credit losses  on trade receivables using a provision matrix on the  basis of its historical credit loss experience.   De-recognition of Financial Assets:     The Company de-recognises a financial asset when  the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset  expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the  asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers  nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership and continues to control the transferred  asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in  the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may  have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial  asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial  asset and also recognises an associated liability.     On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference  between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of  the consideration received and receivable and the  cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in  Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in  other equity is recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.   Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments:   Classification as Debt or Equity:     Debt and equity instruments, issued by the Company,  are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity  in accordance with the substance of the contractual  arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability  and an equity instrument.   Equity Instruments:     An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  a residual interest in the assets of the Company after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments  issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds  received, net of direct issue costs.   Financial Liabilities:     Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition  as fair value through profit or loss: •   Loans and borrowings, •   Payables, or •   as derivatives designated as hedging instruments  in an effective hedge, as appropriate.     All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair  value and in the case of loans and borrowings and  payables, are recognised net of directly attributable  transaction costs.     The Company’s financial liabilities include trade  and other payables, loans and borrowings including  bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and  derivative financial instruments.   Subsequent Measurement:     The measurement of financial liabilities depends on  their classification, as described below:   Financial Liabilities at FVTPL:     Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities  held for trading and financial liabilities designated  upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial  liabilities are classified as held for trading, if they are  incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near  term. This category also includes derivative financial  instruments entered into by the Company that are  not designated as hedging instruments in hedge  relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated  embedded derivatives are also classified as held  for trading, unless they are designated as effective  hedging instruments.     Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 410 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Financial liabilities, designated upon initial recognition  at FVTPL, are designated as such at the initial date  of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109  are satisfied.   Loans and Borrowings:     After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and  borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised  cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.  Gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss when the liabilities are de-recognised  as well as through the EIR amortisation process.     Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account  any discount or premium on acquisition and fees  or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The  EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.   Financial Guarantee Contracts:     Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company  are those contracts that require a payment to be made  to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs, because the  specified debtor fails to make a payment when due,  in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.  Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially  as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs  that are directly attributable to the issuance of the  guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at  the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined  as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109, and the  amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.   De-recognition of Financial Liabilities:     The Company de-recognises financial liabilities  when and only when, the Company’s obligations are  discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference  between the carrying amount of the financial liability  de-recognised and the consideration paid and payable  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   Embedded Derivatives:     An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid  (combined) instrument that also includes a non- derivative host contract – with the effect that some  of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a  way similar to a stand-alone derivative. An embedded  derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that  would otherwise be required by the contract to  be modified according to a specified interest rate,  financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign  exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating  or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case  of a non-financial variable, that the variable is not  specific to a party to the contract. Re-assessment  only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of  the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows  that would otherwise be required or a re-classification  of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit  or loss. If the hybrid contract contains a host that is  a financial asset within the scope of Ind AS 109, the  Company does not separate embedded derivatives.  Rather, it applies the classification requirements  contained in Ind AS 109, to the entire hybrid contract.  Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts are  accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at  fair value, if their economic characteristics and risks  are not closely related to those of the host contracts,  and the host contracts are not held for trading or  designated at fair value though profit or loss. These  embedded derivatives are measured at fair value  with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss,  unless designated as effective hedging instruments.   Offsetting of Financial Instruments:     Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and  the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet, if  there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset  the recognised amounts and there is an intention to  settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle  the liabilities simultaneously. 1.20   Revenue Recognition: (a)   Revenue from contracts with customers; •   Revenue is recognised when the Company satisfies  a performance obligation on the basis of approved  contracts regarding the transfer of goods or  services to a customer. This is achieved when  control of the product has been transferred to the  customer, which generally occurs at a point in time. •   The Company considers the terms of the contract  in determining the transaction price. The  transaction price is based upon the amount the  Company expects to be entitled to in exchange  for transferring of promised goods and services to  the customer after deducting incentive programs,  including but not limited to discounts, volume  rebates etc. The transaction price of goods sold and  services rendered is net of variable consideration  411 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 and excludes taxes and duties collected on behalf  of the Government. •   Variable consideration - This includes incentives,  volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at  contract inception considering the terms of various  schemes with customers and constrained until it is  highly probable that a significant revenue reversal  in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised  will not occur when the associated uncertainty  with the variable consideration is subsequently  resolved. It is reassessed at the end of each  reporting period. •   Significant financing component - Generally, the  Company receives short-term advances from its  customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS  115, the Company does not adjust the promised  amount of consideration for the effects of a  significant financing component if it expects, at  contract inception, that the period between the  transfer of the promised goods or services to the  customer and when the customer pays for that  goods or services will be one year or less.   (b)     Div idend income is accounted for when the right  to receive the income is established.   (c)     For a ll financial instruments measured at  amortised cost or at fair value through Other  Comprehensive Income, interest income is  recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR),  which is the rate that exactly discounts the  estimated future cash payments or receipts  through the expected life of the financial  instrument to the gross carrying amount of the  financial asset.   (d)     Insu rance, railway and other claims, where  quantum of accruals cannot be ascertained  with reasonable certainty, are accounted on  acceptance basis. 1.21   Contract liability:     Contract liability is recognised when a payment  for customer is already received before a related  performance obligation is satisfied. If a customer  pays consideration before the Company transfers  goods or services to the customer, a contract liability  is recognised when the payment is received.     As these are contracts that the Company expects,  and has the ability, to fulfil through delivery of a  non-financial item, these are presented as advance  from customers and are recognised as revenue  as and when control of respective commodities is  transferred or service is provided to the customers  under the agreements. 1.22   Leases:     The Company assesses whether a contract contains  a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is,  or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right  to control the use of an identified asset for a period of  time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether  a contract conveys the right to control the use of an  identified asset, the Company assesses whether •   the contract involves the use of identified asset; •   the Company has substantially all of the economic  benefits from the use of the asset through the  period of lease; and •   the Company has the right to direct the use of  the asset.   As a Lessee:     The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a  lease liability at the lease commencement date. The  right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which  comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for any lease payments made at or before  the commencement date, plus any initial direct  costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle  and remove the underlying asset or to restore the  underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less  any lease incentives received.     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using the straight-line method from the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of the  useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the  lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use  assets are determined on the same basis as those of  property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use  asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if  any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the  lease liability.     The lease liability is initially measured at the present  value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be  readily determined, the Company’s incremental  412 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.     Lease payments included in the measurement of the  lease liability comprise the following: •   Fixed payments, including in-substance  fixed payments; •   Variable lease payments that depend on an index  or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate  as at the commencement date; •   Amounts expected to be payable under a residual  value guarantee; and •   The exercise price under a purchase option that  the Company is reasonably certain to exercise,  lease payments in an optional renewal period if  the Company is reasonably certain to exercise  an extension option, and penalties for early  termination of a lease, unless the Company is  reasonably certain not to terminate early.     The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method. It is remeasured when  there is a change in future lease payments arising from  a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in  the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to  be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the  Company changes its assessment of whether it will  exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero.     Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-Value  Assets:     The Company has elected not to recognise right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases  that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and  leases of low value assets. The Company recognises  the lease payments associated with these leases as  an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   Sale and Leaseback:     The right of use arising from leaseback is measured  at the proportion of previous carrying amount of  the asset that relates to right of use retained by the  Company. Where sale proceeds received reflect the  asset’s fair value, any gain or loss arising on disposal  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss, to  the extent that it relates to the rights that have been  transferred. Gains and losses that relate to the rights,  that have been retained are included in the carrying  amount of the right of use assets recognised at  commencement of the lease. Where sale proceeds  received are not at the asset’s fair value, any below  market terms are recognised as a prepayment of lease  payments, and above market terms are recognised as  additional financing provided by the lessor. 1.23   Borrowing Costs:     Borrowing cost includes interest expense,  amortisation of discounts, hedge related cost incurred  in connection with foreign currency borrowings,  ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing  of funds and exchange difference, arising from foreign  currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded  as an adjustment to the interest cost.     Borrowing costs, that are attributable to the acquisition  or construction or production of a qualifying asset,  are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till  such time the asset is ready for its intended use. A  qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a  substantial period of time to get ready for its intended  use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an  expense in the period in which they are incurred.     Investment income earned on the temporary  investment of specific borrowings pending their  expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the  borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. All other  borrowing cost are recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss in the period in which they are incurred. 1.24   Trade Receivable:     Trade receivables are held with the objective of  collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore  are subsequently measured at amortised cost less  loss allowance.     Trade receivables which are sold to a bank under  without-recourse factoring arrangement are de- recognised from the Balance Sheet. Under this  arrangement, the Company sells those receivables  for cash proceeds to the factor/bank and transfer  related risks and rewards – primarily credit risk. Trade  receivables which are sold under with-recourse  factoring arrangements for cash proceeds, are not  413 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 derecognised from the financial statements as the  Company retains substantially all of the risks and  rewards related to such trade receivables. The amount  received on sell of trade receivables under such  arrangements is recognised as a financial liability and  disclosed as short-term borrowings. 1.25   Government Grants and Subsidies:     Government Grants are recognised when there is a  reasonable assurance that the same will be received  and all attached conditions will be complied with.  When the grant relates to an expense item, it is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss by way  of a deduction to the related expense on a systematic  basis over the periods that the related costs, for which  it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the  grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income  on a systematic basis over the expected useful life  of the related asset or in proportion to fulfillment of  related obligation.     Government grants, that are receivable towards capital  investments under State Investment Promotion  Scheme, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss in the period in which they become receivable.     The benefit of a government loan at a below-market  rate of interest is treated as a government grant,  measured as the difference between proceeds  received and the fair value of the loan based  on prevailing market interest rates and is being  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     When the Company receives grants of non-monetary  assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair  value amounts and released to profit or loss over the  expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the  benefit of the underlying asset. 1.26   Exceptional Items:     Exceptional items include income or expense that are  considered to be part of ordinary activities, however,  are of such significance and nature that separate  disclosure enables the user of Financial Statements to  understand the impact in a more meaningful manner.  Exceptional items are identified by virtue of either  their size or nature so as to facilitate comparison with  prior periods and to assess underlying trends in the  financial performance of the Company. 1.27   Provision for Current and Deferred Tax:   Current Income Tax:     Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid  to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax  laws used to compute the amount are those that are  enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting  date in the countries where the Company operates  and generates taxable income.     Interest expenses and penalties, if any, related to  income tax are included in finance cost and other  expenses respectively. Interest income, if any, related  to income tax is included in other income.     Current income tax, relating to items recognised  outside of the Statement of Profit and Loss, is  recognised outside of the Statement of Profit and  Loss (either in Other Comprehensive Income or  in other equity). Current tax items are recognised  in correlation to the underlying transaction either  in OCI or directly in other equity. The management  periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax  returns with respect to situations in which applicable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and  established provisions, where appropriate.   Deferred Tax:     Deferred tax is provided using the liability method  on temporary differences between the tax bases of  assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts for  financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.     Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable  temporary differences, except:     When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial  recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in  a transaction that is not a business combination  and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither  the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and  does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible  temporary differences.     Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible  temporary differences, the carry forward of unused  tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax  assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable  that taxable profit will be available, against which  the deductible temporary differences, and the carry  forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses  can be utilised, except: 414 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible  temporary differences arises from the initial  recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that  is not a business combination and, at the time of the  transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor  taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal  taxable and deductible temporary differences.     The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed  at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that  it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit  will be available to allow all or part of the deferred  tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax  assets are re-assessed at each reporting date, and are  recognised to the extent that it has become probable  that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax  asset to be recovered.     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when  the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based  on tax rates (and tax laws), that have been enacted or  substantively enacted at the reporting date.     Deferred tax, relating to items recognised outside  profit or loss, is recognised outside profit or loss (either  in Other Comprehensive Income or in other equity).  Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to  the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly  in other equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred  tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right  exists to set off current tax assets against current tax  liabilities, and the deferred taxes relate to the same  taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 1.28   Provisions and Contingent Liabilities:     Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result  of a past event, it is probable that the Company will  be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.     If the effect of the time value of money is material,  provisions are determined by discounting the  expected future cash flows to net present value using  an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessments of the time value of  money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to  the liability.     A present obligation that arises from past events,  where it is either not probable that an outflow of  resources will be required to settle or a reliable  estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed  as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also  disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising  from past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events not wholly  within the control of the Company.     Claims against the Company, where the possibility of  any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, are  not disclosed as contingent liabilities.     Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial  statements since this may result in the recognition  of income that may never be realised. However,  when the realisation of income is virtually certain,  then the related asset is not a contingent asset and  is recognised.   Warranty Provisions:     Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognised  as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss  when the product is sold or service provided to the  customer. Initial recognition is based on historical  experience. The initial estimate of warranty-related  costs is revised annually. 1.29   Earnings Per Share (EPS):     Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing  the net profit for the year attributable to equity  shareholders by the weighted-average number  of equity shares outstanding during the period.  The weighted-average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period and for all periods  presented is adjusted for events such as bonus  issue; bonus element in a rights issue to existing  shareholders; share split; and reverse share split  (consolidation of shares) that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a  corresponding change in resources.     For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per  share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable  to equity shareholders and the weighted-average  number of shares outstanding during the period  are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential  equity shares. 415 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 1.30    Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and  Assumptions:     The preparation of financial statements, in conformity  with the Ind AS requires judgements, estimates and  assumptions to be made, that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities on the date of  the financial statements, the reported amounts of  revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the disclosures relating to contingent liabilities  as of the date of the financial statements. Although,  these estimates are based on the management’s best  knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty  about these assumptions and estimates could result  in outcomes different from the estimates. Difference  between actual results and estimates are recognised  in the period in which the results are known or  materialise. Estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to  accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in  the current and future periods.     The key assumptions concerning the future and other  key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting  date, that have a significant risk of causing a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of asset and  liabilities within the next financial year, are described  below. The Company based its assumptions and  estimates on parameters available when the financial  statements were prepared. Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments,  however, may change due to market changes or  circumstances arising that are beyond the control  of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the  assumptions when they occur.   •   Cla ssification of Lease Ind AS 116:       Ind AS 1 16 Leases requires a lessee to determine  the lease term as the non-cancellable period of  a lease adjusted with any option to extend or  terminate the lease, if the use of such option  is reasonably certain. The Company makes an  assessment on the expected lease term on lease  by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it  is reasonably certain that any options to extend  or terminate the contract will be exercised.  In evaluating the lease term, the Company  considers factors such as any significant  leasehold improvements undertaken over the  lease term, costs relating to the termination  of lease and the importance of the underlying  lease to the Company’s operations taking into  account the location of the underlying asset  and the availability of the suitable alternatives.  The lease term in future periods is reassessed to  ensure that the lease term reflects the current  economic circumstances. The discount rate is  generally based on the incremental borrowing  rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a  portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.   •   Litigation and Contingencies:       The Company has ongoing litigations with various  regulatory authorities. Where an outflow of funds  is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate  of the outcome of the dispute can be made based  on the management’s assessment of specific  circumstances of each dispute and relevant  external advice, the management provides for its  best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by  nature complex and can take number of years to  resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty.  Information about such litigations is provided in  notes to the financial statements.   •     Ass essment of Impairment of Investments in  Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures:       The C ompany reviews its carrying value of  investments in subsidiaries, associates and  joint ventures annually, or more frequently  when there is indication for impairment. If the  recoverable amount is less than its carrying  amount, the impairment loss is accounted  for. Determining whether the investments in  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are  impaired requires an estimate in the value in use  of investments. The Management carries out  impairment assessment for each investment by  comparing the carrying value of each investment  with the net worth of each company based on  audited financials, comparable market price  and comparing the performance of the investee  companies with projections used for valuations,  in particular those relating to the cash flows,  sales growth rate, pre-tax discount rate and  growth rates used and approved business plans.   •     Use ful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment  and Intangible Assets:       The  Company uses its technical expertise  along with historical and industry trends for  determining the economic life of an asset/ component of an asset. The useful lives are  reviewed by the management periodically and  416 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the  unamortised depreciable amount is charged over  the remaining useful life of the assets.   •   Mea surement of Defined Benefit Obligation:       The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan  and the present value of the gratuity obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations. An  actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include  the determination of the discount rate, future  salary increases and mortality rates. Due to  the complexities involved in the valuation  and its long-term nature, a defined benefit  obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at  each reporting date.   •     Rec ognition and Measurement of Provisions  and Contingencies:       Key  assumptions about the likelihood and  magnitude of an outflow of resources.       The Company reviews and recognises provisions  on periodic basis. Provisions are recognised,  when the Company has a present obligation as  a result of a past event and it is probable that  an outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation  and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of the obligation.   •     Fair Value Measurement of Financial  Instruments:       Whe n the fair value of financial assets and  financial liabilities recorded in the Balance Sheet  cannot be measured based on quoted prices in  active markets, their fair values are measured  using valuation techniques including the  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The inputs to  these models are taken from observable market  where possible, but where this is not feasible, a  degree of judgement is required in establishing  fair values. Judgement includes consideration  of input such as liquidity risk, credit risk and  volatility. Changes in assumptions about these  factors could affect the reported fair value of  financial instruments.   •   Sha re-Based Payments:       The Company measures the cost of equity-settled  transactions with employees using Black-Scholes  Model and Binomial Model to determine the fair  value of the liability incurred on the grant date.  Estimating fair value for share-based payment  transactions requires determination of the most  appropriate valuation model, which is dependent  on the terms and conditions of the grant.       Thi s estimate also requires determination of  the most appropriate inputs to the valuation  model including the expected life of the share  option, volatility and dividend yield and making  assumptions about them.       The assumptions and models used for estimating  fair value for share-based payment transactions  are disclosed in Note 4.8. 1.31   Cash Dividend to Equity Holders of the Company:     The Company recognises a liability to make cash  distributions to equity holders of the Company when  the distribution is authorised and the distribution  is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As  per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is  authorised when it is approved by the shareholders.  A corresponding amount is recognised directly in  other equity. 1.32   Recent Accounting Pronouncements:   i)     New a nd amended standards adopted by the  Company:       Min istry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies  new standards or amendments to the existing  standards under the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time  to time. For the year ended 31 st  March 2025, MCA  has notified Ind AS-117 Insurance Contracts. The  Company has reviewed the new pronouncements  and based on its evaluation has determined that  it has no impact on the financial statements.  417 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements

The Gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment  to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of service, whichever is earlier, of an amount  equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary for each completed year of service as per rules framed in this regard. Vesting occurs  upon completion of five continuous years of service in accordance with Indian law. In case of majority of employees, the  Company’s scheme is more favourable as compared to the obligation under payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The present value of obligation is determined based on actuarial valuation using the Projected Unit Credit Method as  prescribed by the Ind AS-19 - ‘Employee Benefits’, which recognises each period of service as giving rise to additional unit  of employee benefit entitlement and measure each unit separately to build up final obligation. Inherent Risk: The plan is defined benefit in nature which is sponsored by the Company and hence it underwrites all the risks pertaining to  the plan. In particular, this exposes the Company to actuarial risk such as adverse salary growth, changes in demographic  experience, inadequate return on underlying plan assets. This may result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits  to employees in future. Since the benefits are lump sum in nature, the plan is not subject to any longevity risk. Pension: The Company provides pension to few retired employees as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. Inherent Risk: The plan is of a defined benefit in nature which is sponsored by the Company and hence it underwrites all the risks  pertaining to the plan. In particular, there is a risk for the Company that any adverse increase in salary increases for  serving employees/pension increase for pensioners or adverse demographic experience can result in an increase in cost  of providing these benefits to employees in future.

Disclosure of Financial Instruments:   i.     Investments in Equity Instruments (other than Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates) designated at  FVTOCI       These investments have been designated on initial recognition to be measured at FVTOCI as these are strategic  investments and are not intended for sale.   ii.   Investment in Debentures and Bonds measured at FVTOCI       Inve stments in Debentures or Bonds meet the contractual cash flow test as required by Ind AS 109- Financial  Instruments. However, the business Model of the Company is such that it does not hold these investments till  maturity as the Company intends to sell these investments as and when need arises. Hence, the same have been  measured at FVTOCI.   iii.

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 C.   Fair Value Measurements (Ind AS 113):     The fair values of the Financial Assets and Liabilities are included at the amount, at which the instrument could be  exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.     The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments based  on the input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:   Level 1:     Thi s hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair  value of all Equity Shares which are traded on the stock exchanges, is valued using the closing price at the  reporting date.   Level 2:     The f air value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over  the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable  market data and rely as little as possible on company specific estimates. The mutual fund units are valued  using the closing Net Asset Value. Investments in Debentures or Bonds are valued on the basis of dealer’s  quotation based on fixed income and money market association (FIMMDA).         If al l significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in  Level 2.     Level 3:     If on e or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included  in Level 3. For assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value as at Balance Sheet date, the classification of fair value calculation  by category is summarised below: H   in crore Quantitative disclosures fair value measurement hierarchy for  assets and liabilities  Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Year Ended 31 st  March 2025 Financial Assets 1.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial  assets, other than derivatives, include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that arise  directly from its operations. The Company’s activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk and foreign exchange. Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of  a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign  currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive  instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments, including investments and  deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings. The Company’s overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise  potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company. The Company uses derivative financial instruments,  to hedge foreign currency risk exposure. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or  speculative instruments. 480 Grasim Industries Limited

It also updates on periodical basis about various risk to the business and  the status of various activities planned to mitigate such risks. Details relating to the risks are provided here below: A.   Foreign Exchange Rate Risk:     Foreign exchange risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency,  which fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign  exchange rates relates to import of fuels, raw materials and spare parts, plant and equipment, exports, foreign  currency borrowings and net investment in foreign subsidiaries /Joint ventures.     The Company regularly evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company  follows the established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments  like forward covers to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.     When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives  to match the terms of the foreign currency exposure. (i)   Foreign Currency Sensitivity:     The sensitivities are based on financial assets and liabilities held at 31 st  March 2025 that are not denominated in Indian  Rupees. The sensitivities do not take into account the Company’s sales and costs and the results of the sensitivities  could change due to other factors such as changes in the value of financial assets and liabilities as a result of non- foreign exchange influenced factors. 481 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports      Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements

Interest Rate Risk:     Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in prevailing market interest rates. For all long-term borrowings in foreign currency with floating interest rates,  the risk of variation in the interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps. The Company constantly monitors  the credit markets and revisits its financing strategies to achieve an optimal maturity profile and financing cost.

For foreign currency long-term borrowings with floating rates, the risk of variation in the  interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps. These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.  The Company constantly monitors the credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to achieve an optimal  maturity profile and financing cost. 484 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 C.   Equity Price Risk:     The Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from Equity Investments (other than Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures  and Associates, which are carried at cost).   Equity Price Sensitivity Analysis:     The Sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the end of the  reporting period.     If equity prices of the quoted investments increase/decrease by 5%, Other Comprehensive income for the year ended  31 st  March 2025 would increase/decrease by  H   544.10 crore (for the year ended 31 st  March 2024 by  H   573.29 crore). D.   Credit Risk:     Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a customer contract or  financial instrument, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities  primarily trade receivables and from its financing/ investing activities, including deposits with banks, mutual fund  investments, investments in debt securities and foreign exchange transactions. The Company has no significant  concentration of credit risk with any counterparty.   The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. (i)   Trade Receivables:     Trade receivables are consisting of a large number of customers. The Company has credit evaluation policy for each  customer and, based on the evaluation, credit limit of each customer is defined. Wherever the Company assesses  the credit risk as high, the exposure is backed by either bank, guarantee/letter of credit or security deposits.   Total Trade receivables as on 31 st  March 2025 is  H   2,553.92 crore (31 st  March 2024 is  H   1,974.31 crore)   The Company does not have higher concentration of credit risks to a single customer.     Single largest customers of the Company have exposure of 3.00% of total sales (31 st  March 2025: 4.15%) and in  receivables 3.50% (31 st  March 2024: 4.60%).     The ageing analysis of the receivables (net of provision) has been considered from the date the invoice falls due, refer  note 2.11.2.     As per simplified approach, the Company makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivables using a  provision matrix to mitigate the risk of default in payments and makes appropriate provision for loss allowance at  each reporting date wherever outstanding is for longer period and involves higher risk.

To the Members of Grasim Industries Limited Report on the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements  of Grasim Industries Limited (hereinafter referred to as  the “Holding Company” or the “Parent” or “the Company”)  and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries  together referred to as “the Group”), its associates and  its joint ventures, which comprise the consolidated  balance sheet as at 31 st  March 2025, and the consolidated  statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive  income), consolidated statement of changes in equity and  consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then  ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,  including a summary of material accounting policies and  other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as  “the consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, and based on  the consideration of reports of one of the joint auditors of  the Parent and other auditors on separate/consolidated  financial statements /financial information of such  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as were audited  by the one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other  auditors, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements  give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013  (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair  view in conformity with the accounting principles generally  accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the  Group, its associates and joint ventures as at 31 st  March  2025, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive  income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated  cash flows for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards  on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the  Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further  described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit  of the Consolidated financial statements section of our  report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and  joint ventures in accordance with the ethical requirements  that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial  statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the  relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our  other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained  by us along with the consideration of reports of the one of  the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors referred  to in paragraph (a) and (b) of the “Other Matters” section  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Emphasis of Matter a.     We draw attention to Note 4.3 (a) of the consolidated  financial statements regarding the Composite Scheme  of Arrangement for merger (‘Scheme’) of Cement  Business Division of Kesoram Industries Limited with  the Ultratech Cement Limited (“Ultratech”) which has  been described in the said note. The Scheme has been  approved by National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata  and Mumbai (‘NCLT’) vide its orders dated 14 th  November  2024 and 26 th  November 2024 respectively with  appointed date of 1 st  April 2024 and a certified copy has  been filed by Ultratech with the Registrar of Companies,  Mumbai, on 26 th  December 2024. In accordance with  the Scheme approved by the NCLT, Ultratech has given  effect to the Scheme from the retrospective appointed  date specified therein i.e. 1 st  April 2024 which overrides  the relevant requirement of Ind AS 103 “Business  Combinations” (according to which the Scheme would  have been accounted for from 1 st  March 2025 which is  the date of acquisition as per the aforesaid standard).  The financial impact of the aforesaid treatment has  been disclosed in the aforesaid note. Our opinion is not  modified in respect of this matter. b.     We draw attention to Note 4.1.2 (a) of the consolidated  financial statements which refer to Orders dated  31 st  August 2016 (Penalty of  H   1,804.31 crore) and  19 th  January 2017 (Penalty of  H   68.30 crore) of the  Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) against  which Ultratech (including the erstwhile UltraTech  Nathdwara Cement Limited and the India Cements  Limited), subsidiaries of the Parent had filed appeal.  Upon the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal  (“NCLAT”) disallowing its appeal against the CCI order  dated 31 st  August 2016, Ultratech has filed an appeal  before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, which has  by its order dated 5 th  October 2018, granted a stay  against the NCLAT order. Consequently, Ultratech  has deposited an amount of  H   180.43 crore equivalent  to 10% of the penalty of  H   1,804.31 crore recorded as  asset. Ultratech, backed by legal opinions, believes  that it has a good case in both the matters basis  which no provision has been recognised in the books  of account. Our opinion is not modified in respect of  these matters. Independent Auditor’s Report 490 Grasim Industries Limited 

Key Audit Matter Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement and based on the consideration of reports of the  one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors on separate/consolidated financial statements of components  audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in  forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Description of Key Audit Matters: Assessment of impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles See Notes 2.4 and 2.5 to consolidated financial statements  The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •     As disclosed in not e 2.4 and 2.5 of consolidated financial  statements, the Group has goodwill of  H   21,368.69 crore and  other intangible assets of  H   12,696.58 crore as at 31 st  March  2025 which represents goodwill and other intangibles assets  acquired through various business combinations and allocated  to cash generating units (“CGU”). •     A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated and  to which intangible assets belong to is tested for impairment  annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that  the unit may be impaired. •     As disclosed in not e 2.4 and 2.5, impairment of goodwill and  other intangibles is determined by assessing the recoverable  amount of each CGU to which these assets relate. •     We have identified the annual impairment assessment as key  audit matter because of the amounts involved, complexity  in assessment, judgemental by nature, significant changes  in business environment and further based on the inherent  subjectivity, uncertainty and judgement involved in the  following key assumptions:   A.   projected future cash inflows   B.     expected growth rate, discount rate, terminal growth rate   C.   benchmarking of price and marke t multiples Our audit procedures included: •     Evaluated the design and implemented and tested the  operating effectiveness of internal controls over the impairment  assessment process; •     Obtained an understanding of the process followed by the  management in determining the CGU to which goodwill/ intangible assets are allocated and determination of recoverable  amounts of CGU; •     Evaluated the competence, capabilities and independence  of the specialist engaged by the Company and analysed the  valuation reports issued by such specialist; •     Evaluated the model used in determining the recoverable  amount of each CGU; •     Engaged valuation expert to assist in evaluating the key  assumptions of the valuations and methodology of assumptions; •     Tested the arithmetical accuracy of the computation of  recoverable amounts of each CGU; •     Assessed the disclosures provided by the Group in relation to  its annual impairment test in note to consolidated financial  statements. KAM as reported by the auditors of UltraTech Revenue recognition – Discounts, incentives and rebates See Notes 3.1 to consolidated financial statements  The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •     Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives and rebates  given to the customers on the UltraTech’s sales. •     UltraTech’s presence across different marketing regions within  the country and the competitive business environment makes  the assessment of various types of discounts, incentives and  rebates complex. •     Therefore, there is a risk of revenue being misstated as a result  of variations in the assessment of discounts, incentives and  rebates. •     Given the complexity and amounts pertaining to such provision  for discounts, incentives and rebates being significant, this is a  key audit matter. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: •     Assessed the UltraTech’s accounting policies relating to  revenue, discounts, incentives and rebates by comparing with  applicable accounting standards; •     Evaluated the design and implementation and tested the  operating effectiveness of UltraTech’s internal controls over  the provisions, approvals and disbursements of discounts,  incentives and rebates; •     Assessed the UltraTech’s computations for accrual of discounts,  incentives and rebates, on a sample basis, and compared the  accruals made with the approved schemes and underlying  documents; •     Verified, on a sample basis, the underlying documentation for  discounts, incentives and rebates recorded and disbursed  during the year; •     Compared the historical trend of payments and reversal of  discounts, incentives and rebates to provisions made to assess  the current year accruals; Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.) 491 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Regulations - Litigations and claims See Notes 4.1 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •     UltraTech operates in various States within India and is  exposed to different Central and State/Local laws, regulations  and interpretations thereof. Due to a complex regulatory  environment, there is an inherent risk of litigations and claims. •     Consequently, pr ovisions and contingent liability disclosures  may arise from indirect tax proceedings, legal proceedings,  including regulatory and other government/ department  proceedings, as well as investigations by authorities and  commercial claims. •     UltraTech applies significant judgement in estimating the  likelihood of the future outcome in each case and in determining  the provisions or disclosures required for each matter. •     Resolution of tax and legal proceedings may span over multiple  years due to the highly complex nature and magnitude of the  legal matters involved and may involve protracted negotiation  or litigation. •     These estimates and outcome could change significantly over  time as new facts emerge and each legal case progresses. •     Given the inherent complexity and magnitude of potential  exposures and the judgement necessary to estimate the  amount of provisions required or to determine required  disclosures, this is a key audit matter. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: •     Understood the processes, evaluated the design and  implementation of controls and tested the operating  effectiveness of the UltraTech’s controls over the recording and  re-assessment of uncertain legal positions, claims (including  claims receivable) and contingent liabilities; •     Gained an underst anding of outstanding litigations against  UltraTech from their inhouse legal counsel and other key  managerial personnel who have knowledge of these matters; •     Read the correspondence between UltraTech and the various  indirect tax/legal authorities and the legal opinions of external  legal advisors, where applicable, for significant matters; •     Challenged the  UltraTech’s estimate of the possible outcome  of the disputed cases based on applicable indirect tax laws and  legal precedence by involving our tax specialists; •     Assessed the adequacy of the amount of UltraTech’s provision  and disclosures in respect of contingent liabilities for indirect  tax and legal matters.  Business combinations See Note 4.3 (a), (b) and (c) to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit During the financial year, the Ultratech has carried out following  business combinations as below: •     The acquisition of the Cement Business Division of Kesoram  Industries Limited. •   The acquisition of a controlling stake in The India Cements Limited and Ras Al Khaimah Co. for White Cement and  Construction Materials P.S.C. Ultratech undertook business combinations that required  accounting under Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. This process  necessitates the application of the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA)  method, which involves allocating the purchase consideration to  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on  their fair values. This involves complexity and significant judgement  in fair value assessments. Considering the complexity and significant judgement required  in fair value assessments, combined with the material magnitude  of the acquisitions undertaken by Ultratech, this matter has been  identified as a key audit matter. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: Read the scheme of arrangement, underlying agreements and  regulatory orders to understand the key terms and conditions of the  acquisitions. Evaluated the accounting treatment followed by the Group with  reference to provisions of Ind AS 103. Obtained understanding of the process followed by Ultratech and  evaluated the design and implementation, tested the operating  effectiveness of key internal controls related to the valuation  process. Evaluated competence, capabilities and independence of the  experts engaged by them. Involved valuation specialist with specialised skills and knowledge  to assist in: •     Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies  applied and also, to test the inputs to the valuation models used  to determine the value of Property, Plant and Equipment and  intangible assets; •     Evaluating the key assumptions such as discount rate, royalty  rate, growth rate etc. by comparing it to a range of rates that  were independently developed using publicly available market  indices and market data for comparable entities; •     Evaluating market rates and replacement cost basis knowledge  of the business and independent market sources to develop the  fair value of property, plant and equipment. Involved indirect tax specialist with specialised skills and knowledge  to assist in evaluating the UltraTech’s judgement to recognise and  measure fair value of indirect tax litigations, for selected matters. Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of the  acquisition in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 103. Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.) 492 Grasim Industries Limited 

KAM as reported by the auditors of Aditya Birla Capital Limited Impairment of testing of goodwill See Notes 2.4 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •     Aditya Birla Capital Limited (“ABCL”) has goodwill of  H   554.83  crore as of 31 st  March 2025 which represents goodwill acquired  through various business combinations and allocated to Cash  Generating Units (“CGU”). •     As per ABCL’s Gr oup’s policy, a CGU to which goodwill has been  allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently  when there is an indication of the unit may be impaired. •     Impairment of goodwill is determined by assessing the  recoverable amount of each CGU to which these assets relate. •     The Statutory auditors of ABCL has identified the annual  impairment assessment as a key audit matter because of  its being an area of estimate and judgement, exposed to  significant changes in external business environment and is  based on following key assumptions like:   i.   Determination of comparable companies;   ii.     Internal data of the Company used for valuation purpose;  and   iii.   Market multiple s. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: Design and Controls •     Tested the design and the operating effectiveness of internal  controls over the impairment assessment process including  valuation methodology used in impairment assessment on the  carrying value of goodwill; and •     Obtained an understanding of the process followed by ABCL  in determining the CGU to which goodwill is allocated and  determination of recoverable amount of each CGU. Substantive Procedures •     Compared the ABCL’s assumptions and data to externally  sourced/internal data in relation to key inputs such as share  price in the market capitalisation, book value etc.; •     Evaluated ABCL’s key assumptions used in the valuation  methodology; •     Tested the arithmetical accuracy of computation of recoverable  amounts of each CGU; •     Assessing the completeness and accuracy of the consolidated  financial statements disclosures made by the Group as per  applicable Ind AS. Impairment of loans to Customers The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Total Loans as at 31 st  March 2025:  H   1,24,122.94 crore against  which an impairment loss of  H   1,778.43 crore has been recorded. ABCL has recognised impairment provision for loan assets based  on the Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) approach laid down under Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments The estimation of ECL involves significant management judgement  and estimates and the use of different modelling techniques and  assumptions which could have a material impact on reported  profits. Significant management judgement and assumptions  involved in measuring ECL is required with respect to: •     ensuring completene ss and accuracy of the data used to create  assumptions in the model. •     determining the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk. •     factoring in future economic assumptions techniques used  to determine probability of default, loss given default and  exposure at default. These parameters are derived from the ABCL’s internally developed  statistical models and other historical data. Disclosure The disclosures regarding the ABCL application of Ind AS 109 are  key to explaining the key judgements and material inputs to the  ECL results. Further, disclosures to be provided as per RBI circulars  with regards to Non- Performing Assets and provisions is also an  area of focus. Considering the significance of the above matter to the overall  Financial Statements and extent of management’s estimates and  judgements involved, it required significant auditor attention.  Accordingly, ABCL have identified this as a key audit matter.

The statutory auditor of Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited (‘ABHFL’), a subsidiary of ABCL, have reported a key  audit matter on Provisioning based on Expected Credit Loss model (ECL) under IND AS 109 and testing of Impairment  of assets, more particularly the Loan Book of ABHFL The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Subjective Estimates •     Under Ind AS 109, “Financial instrumen ts” allowance for  loan losses are determined using expected credit loss  (‘ECL’) estimation model. The estimation of ECL on financial  instruments involves significant judgement and estimates  and therefore increased levels of audit focus in the ABHFL’s  estimation of ECLs, which are as under:   -     Data inputs - The application of ECL model requires several  data inputs. This increases the risk of completeness  and accuracy of the data that has been used to create  assumptions in the model.   -     Model estima tions - Inherently judgemental models  are used to estimate ECL which involves determining  Probabilities of Default (“PD”), Loss Given Default (“LGD”),  and Exposures at Default (“EAD”). The PD and the LGD are  the key drivers of estimation complexity in the ECL and as  a result are considered the most significant judgemental  aspect of the ABHFL’s modelling approach.   -     Economic scenarios - Ind AS 109 r equires the Company  to measure ECLs on an unbiased forward-looking basis  reflecting a range of future economic indicators. Significant  management judgement is applied in determining the  economic scenarios used and the probability weights  applied to them. •     The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk  assessment, they determined that the impairment of loans and  advances to customers, involving estimations and judgements,  with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than  the materiality for the ABHFL’s Ind AS Financial Statements as  a whole. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: •   Review of Policy/procedures & design/controls; •     Minutely going through the Board approved Policy and approach  note concerning the assessment of credit and other risks  and ascertainment/ageing of ‘default’ by the borrowers and  procedures in relation to stages and ECL computation; •     Testing key controls relating to selection and implementation  of material macro    economic variables and the con trols over the  scenario selection and application of probability weights; •    Assessing the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of key internal financial controls including  monitoring process of overdue loans (including those which  became overdue after the reporting date), measurement of  provision, stage    wise classification o f loans, identification of NPA  accounts, assessing the reliability of management information; •    Understanding management’s approach, interpretation,  systems and controls implemented in relation to probability of  default and stage-wise bifurcation of product-wise portfolios for  timely ascertainment of stress and early warning signals; •     Testing and review of controls over measurement of provisions  and disclosures in the Ind AS Financial Statements; •     Involvement of Information system resource to obtain comfort  over data integrity and process of report generation through  interface of various systems. Walk through the processes which  involve manual work to ascertain existence of maker-checker  controls •     Understanding of models and general economic indicator  criteria used for regression testing over data of the loan book; Substantive verification •     Sample tes ting over key inputs, data and assumptions impacting  ECL calculations to assess the completeness, accuracy and  relevance of data and reasonableness of economic forecasts,  weights, and model assumptions applied; •     Model calculations t esting through selective re- performance,  wherever possible; •     Assessing disclosures - Assessed whether the disclosures  on key judgements, assumptions and quantitative data with  respect to impairment loans (including restructuring related  disclosures) in the Ind AS Financial Statements are appropriate  and sufficient as also aligned to regulatory requirements.

The Financial accounting system of  the ABHFL is interfaced with several other IT systems including  Loan Management & Originating systems and several other  systemic workflows. •     IT general and application controls are critical to ensure that  changes to applications and underlying data are made in an  appropriate manner. Adequate controls contribute to mitigating  the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to  the applications and data. These includes implementation of  preventive and detective controls across critical applications  and infrastructure. •     Due to the pervasive nature of role of information technology  systems in financial reporting, in our preliminary risk  assessment, they planned audit by assessing the risk of  a material misstatement arising from the technology as  significant for the audit, hence the Key Audit Matter. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: In course of audit, they, inter alia, reviewed user access management,  change management, segregation of duties, system reconciliation  controls and key financial accounting and reporting systems. •     Review of the report of IS Audit carried in earlier year(s) by  an independent firm of Chartered Accountants pertaining  to IT systems general controls including access rights over  applications, operating systems and databases relied upon for  financial reporting; •     Deployed internal experts to carry out IT general controls testing  and identifying gaps, if any. •   Other processe s include:   -     Selectively recomputing in terest calculations and maturity  dates;   -     Selectively re-e valuating masters updation, interface with  resultant reports like LTV Report, SUD Report, Portfolio  movement Report;   -     Selective te sting of the interface of SAP FA module with  other IT systems like Loan Management System and other  workflows;   -     Testing of the system generated reports and accounting  entries manually for core financial reporting matters (i.e.  verification around the computer system);   -     Evaluating the design, implementation and operating  effectiveness of the significant accounts-related IT  automated controls which are relevant to the accuracy  of system calculation, and the consistency of data  transmission. The statutory auditor of Aditya Birla Money Limited (‘ABML’), a subsidiary of ABCL, have reported a key audit matter  on Information Technology and General Controls The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •     The financial accounting and r eporting systems of the ABML  are fundamentally reliant on IT systems and IT controls to  process significant volume of transaction. •     Due to the complexity, large volume of transactions processed  daily and reliance on automated and IT dependent manual  controls, matter pertaining to adequacy and effectiveness of IT  control environment is considered as a Key Audit Matter. •     Areas of audit focus included user access management,  developer access to the production environment and changes  to the IT environment. These are key to ensuring, IT dependent  and application based controls are operating effectively. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: •     Understood and assessed the overall IT control environment  and the controls in place which included controls over access to  systems and data, as well as system changes; •     Tested the design and operating effectiveness of IT access  controls over the information systems that are important to  financial reporting and various interfaces, configuration and  other identified application controls; •     Tested IT general controls (logical access, changes management  and aspects of IT operational controls). This included testing  that requests for access to systems were appropriately reviewed  and authorised; •     Tested the ABML’s periodic review of access rights.

Also, IT application controls are critical to ensure that changes  to applications and underlying data are made in an appropriate  manner and under controlled environments. Appropriate  controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud  or errors as a result of changes to applications and data. On  account of the pervasive use of its IT systems, the testing of the  general computer controls of the IT systems used in financial  reporting was considered to be a Key Audit Matter. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: •     With the assistance o f ABSLICL‘s IT specialists, they obtained an  understanding of the ABSLICL ‘s IT applications, databases and  operating systems relevant to financial reporting and the control  environment. For these elements of the IT infrastructure the  areas of our focus included access security (including controls  over privileged access), program change controls, database  management and network operations. •   In Particular:   -     Tested the design, implementation, and operating  effectiveness of the ABSLICL’s general IT controls over the  IT systems relevant to financial reporting.

The statutory auditor of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited (‘ABSLAMCL’), an associate of ABCL, have reported a key  audit matter on Revenue from Asset Management and Advisory Fees and Management Fees The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •     Revenue from operations is the most significant balance in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. It majorly comprises of:   -     Asset Managemen t and Advisory Fees amounting to  H   1,560.96 crore.   -     Management  Fees from Portfolio Management and Other  Services amounting to  H   98.13 crore. •     There are inherent risks in computing the different revenue  streams including manual input of key contractual terms and  computation of applicable Assets Under Management (AUM),  which could result in errors. Considering the complexity in  contractual terms involving multiple schemes, it requires  monitoring to ensure all financial terms and conditions are  captured accurately and applied appropriately. •     Any discrepancy in such computation could give rise to a  material misstatement in the financial statements. •     Accordingly, we have considered revenue from asset  management and advisory fees and management fees from  portfolio management and other services as a key audit matter.  The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: •     Obtained and read the accounting policy for revenue recognition; •     Obtained an understanding of the significant revenue items and  identified where there is a higher risk of error due to manual  processes, complex contractual terms, and areas of judgement; •     Tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls  in place across the Company relevant to recognition of  Management Fees. •     Obtained and read the investment management fee report,  issued by statutory auditors of mutual fund schemes and  reconciled the certified amounts with the accounting records; •     On a sample basis, obtained and tested arithmetical accuracy of  revenue calculation and the reconciliation with the accounting  records; •     On sample basis, verified the input of contractual terms with  rates approved by the management; •     On a sample basis, checked the receipts of such income in bank  statements; •     Re-calculated Asset Management and Advisory fees and  Portfolio Management Services Fees in respect of certain  sample contracts and compared with the actual fees charged by  the ABSLAMCL for such contracts; •     Evaluated the disclosure relating to management fee income  earned by the ABSLAMCL.

The statutory auditor of Aditya Birla ARC Limited (‘ABARCL’), a subsidiary of ABCL, have reported a key audit matter  on Fair Valuation of financial instruments - Security Receipts (SRs) The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •     ABARCL has invested in SRs issued by various trust  incorporated by it for acquisition of distressed credit Business.  Depending on the arrangement such Investments are in the  range of 100%-15% of the total SRs issued by the various trust.  The said SRs are subsequently measured at Fair Value through  Profit and Loss (FVTPL) as per the business model of the  ABARCL and considered as level 3 in the valuation hierarchy.  Total investment in SRs outstanding as on 31 st  March 2025 is  H   3,736.82 Lakh. •     ABARCL determines the fair value of SRs based on the Net  Assets Value (NAV) report provided by the trust. The NAV of  the said investment can only be estimated by the trusts using  a combination of the recovery range provided by the external  rating agency, estimated cash flows, collateral values, discount  rate used and various other assumptions. •     Considering the complexities in volved and various assumptions  and significant judgements made by the trust in deriving Net  Assets Value of such SRs, we have considered the valuation of  these investments as a key audit matter. The Procedures performed by the auditors, as reported by them,  included the following: •     Tested the design and effectiveness of internal controls  implemented by the management in respect of valuation of the  investments including those relating to assessment of recovery  plan by Asset Acquisition Committee for determination of  appropriate recovery rate based on the range provided by the  External Rating Agency. •   Assessment of the valuation inputs;   -     Analysed re asonableness of the estimated cash flows and  recovery rate, the other relevant judgements and estimates,  if any;   -     Assessed the informa tion used to determine the key  assumptions;   -     Compared the his torical estimates of the cash flows with  the actual recoveries and obtained explanations for the  variations, if any;   -     Compared the manag ement’s assumption of discount rate  with the supporting internal/ external evidence;   -   Valuation report of collateral values. Other Information The Holding Company’s Management and Board of  Directors are responsible for the other information. The  other information comprises the information included in  the Holding Company’s annual report, but does not include  the financial statements and auditor’s reports thereon. The  Holding Company’s annual report is expected to be made  available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does  not cover the other information and we do not express any  form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information identified above when it becomes available  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information  is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial  statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read the Holding Company’s annual report, if we  conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we  are required to communicate the matter to those charged  with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable  under the relevant laws and regulations. Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for the Consolidated  Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Management and Board of  Directors are responsible for the preparation and  presentation of these consolidated financial statements  in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and  fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated  profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated  statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash  flows of the Group including its associates and joint  ventures in accordance with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act.  The respective Management and Board of Directors of the  companies included in the Group and of its associates and  joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate  accounting records in accordance with the provisions of  the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and of  its associates and joint ventures and for preventing and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgements and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating  effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of  the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  Independent Auditor’s Report (Contd.) 497 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

presentation of the consolidated financial statements  that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which  have been used for the purpose of preparation of the  consolidated financial statements by the Management and  Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the  respective Management and Board of Directors of the  companies included in the Group and of its associates  and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the  ability of each company to continue as a going concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern  and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the  respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate  the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic  alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies  included in the Group and of its associates and joint  ventures are responsible for overseeing the financial  reporting process of each company. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the  Audit of the Consolidated financial  statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes  our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: •     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or  the override of internal control. •     Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section  143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for  expressing our opinion on whether the company has  adequate internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. •     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by the Management and  Board of Directors. •     Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis  of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial  statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to  events or conditions that may cast significant doubt  on the ability of the Group and its associates and  joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we  conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are  required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to  the related disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to  modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the  audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may  cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures  to cease to continue as a going concern. •     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the consolidated financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  consolidated financial statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. •     Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding  the financial statements/financial information of such  entities or business activities within the Group and  its associates and joint ventures of which we are the  independent auditors. We are responsible for the  direction, supervision and performance of the audit  of the financial statements/financial information of  such entities included in the consolidated financial  statements of which we are the independent auditors.

of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors,  such one of the joint auditors of the Parent and  other auditors remain responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audits carried out  by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit  opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further  described in paragraph (a) and (b) of the section titled  “Other Matters” in this audit report.     We communicate with those charged with governance  of the Holding Company and such other entities  included in the consolidated financial statements  of which we are the independent auditors regarding,  among other matters, the planned scope and timing  of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that we  identify during our audit.     We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and  to communicate with them all relationships and  other matters that may reasonably be thought to  bear on our independence, and where applicable,  related safeguards.     From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters  that were of most significance in the audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current  period and are therefore the key audit matters. We  describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless  law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated  in our report because the adverse consequences of  doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh  the public interest benefits of such communication.

Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for Internal Financial  Controls The respective Company’s Management and the Board of  Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements criteria  established by the respective Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls that were operating effectively for  ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,  To the Independent Auditor’s Report on the consolidated financial statements of Grasim Industries Limited for the year  ended 31 st  March 2025 Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial  statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act (Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of  our report of even date) including adherence to the respective Company’s policies,  the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection  of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable  financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements  based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance  with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing,  prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent  applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements. Those Standards and  the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements  were established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements and their  operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements included  obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk  that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud  or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and  the audit evidence obtained by the one of the joint auditors  of the Parent and other auditors of the relevant subsidiary  companies, associate companies and joint ventures in  terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters  paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements. Annexure B 508 Grasim Industries Limited 

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls  with Reference to Financial Statements A Company’s internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements is a process designed to provide  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s  internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements include those policies and procedures that (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of the Company are being made only in accordance with  authorisations of management and directors of the  Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition,  use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have  a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal  Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements, including  the possibility of collusion or improper management  override of controls, material misstatements due to error  or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections  of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements to future periods are  subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of  compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Other Matter Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on  the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements/ financial information insofar as it relates to 45 subsidiary  companies, 2 associate companies and 6 joint ventures,  which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the  corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies  incorporated in India. Our opinion is not modified in respect  of this matter. For B S R & Co.

Basis Of Preparation And Material  Accounting Policies A.   Basis of preparation:     These consolidated financial statements are  prepared and presented in accordance with the  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,  2015, as amended from time to time as notified under  Section 133 of Companies Act, 2013, the relevant  provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”), and  the guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange  Board of India (SEBI), as applicable. The accounting  policies have been applied consistently to all periods  presented in the financial statements.     The financial statements have been prepared and  presented on the going concern basis and at historical  cost, except for the following assets and liabilities,  which have been measured as indicated below:   i.     Der ivative Financial Instruments measured at fair  value (covered under para 1.24);   ii.     Cer tain financial assets and liabilities at fair  value (refer accounting policy regarding financial  instruments (covered under para 1.25);   iii.     Ass ets held for disposal - measured at the lower  of its carrying amount and fair value less costs  to sell;   iv.     Emp loyee’s Defined Benefit Plans as per  actuarial valuation;   v.     Ass ets and liabilities acquired under Business  Combination measured at fair value; and   vi.     Employee share based payments measured at  fair value.     On account of the regulatory restrictions on transfer  of surplus/funds from the life insurance fund to  shareholders, no proportion of the surplus relating to  life insurance fund (including in respect of contracts  without discretionary participating features) arising  out of the adjustments due to application of Ind  AS principles can be attributed to shareholders.  Therefore, the differences arising from the application  of the Ind AS principles to the assets and liabilities  of the life insurance fund be retained within the “Life  Insurance Policyholders’ Fund”.     Further all income and expenses pertaining to the life  insurance fund have been clubbed with respective  income and expenses. Assets and Liabilities of Life  Insurance fund have been clubbed with respective  assets and liabilities.   Principles Of Consolidation:     The Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) comprise  the Financial Statements of Grasim Industries Limited  (“the Company”) and its Subsidiaries (herein after  referred together as “the Group”), Joint Ventures and  Associates. The CFS of the Group have been prepared  in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards  on “Consolidated Financial Statements” (Ind AS 110),  “Joint Arrangements” (Ind AS 111), “Disclosure of  Interest in Other Entities” (Ind AS 112), “Investment  in Associates and Joint Ventures” (Ind AS 28) notified  under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. (i)   Subsidiaries:     Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.  The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to,  or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement  with the entity and has the ability to affect those  returns through its power over the entity. The  financial statements of subsidiaries are included in  the consolidated financial statements from the date  on which controls commences until the date on which  control ceases. (ii)   Non-Controlling Interest (NCI):     Non-controlling interest in the net assets of the  consolidated subsidiaries consists of: 521 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   a)     The  amount of equity attributable to non- controlling shareholders at the date on which  the investments in the subsidiary companies  were made.   b)     The non-controlling share of movements in equity  since the date the Parent-Subsidiary relationship  comes into existence.       The total comprehensive income of subsidiaries  is attributed to the owners of the Company and  to the non-controlling interests even if this  results in the non-controlling interest having  deficit balance. (iii)   Loss of Control:     When the Group loses control over a subsidiary,  it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the  subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components  of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary  is measured at fair value at the date the control is  lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. (iv)   Equity Accounted Investees:     An associate is an entity over which the Group has  significant influence. Significant influence is the  power to participate in the financial and operating  policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or  joint control over those policies.     A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby  the parties that have joint control of the arrangement  have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint  control is the contractually agreed sharing of control  of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions  about the relevant activities require unanimous  consent of the parties sharing control.     The considerations made in determining whether  significant influence or joint control are similar to those  necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.     The Group’s investments in its associates and joint  ventures are accounted for using the equity method.  Under the equity method, the investment in an  associate or a joint venture is initially recognised  at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is  adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of  net assets of the associate or joint venture since the  acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate  or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of  the investment.     When the Group’s share of losses of an equity  accounted investee exceed the Group’s interest in  that associate or joint venture (which includes any  long-term interest that, in substance, form part of  the Group’s net investment in the associate or joint  venture), the Group discontinues recognising its share  of further losses. Additional losses are recognised  only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or  constructive obligation or made payments on behalf  of the associate or joint venture.     Unrealised gains resulting from the transaction  between the Group and joint ventures are eliminated  to the extent of the interest in the joint venture, and  deferred tax is made on the same.     After application of the equity method, the Group  determines whether it is necessary to recognise an  impairment loss on its investment in its associate  or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group  determines whether there is objective evidence  that the investment in the associate or joint venture  is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group  calculates the amount of impairment as the difference  between the recoverable amount of the associate  or joint venture and its carrying value, and then  recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate  and a joint venture’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     Upon loss of significant influence over the associate  or joint control over the joint venture, the Group  measures and recognises any retained investment  at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying  amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss  of significant influence or joint control and the fair  value of the retained investment and proceeds from  disposal is recognised in profit or loss. (v)   Transaction Eliminated on Consolidation     The financial statements of the Company, its  Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates used in  the consolidation procedure are drawn upto the same  reporting date, i.e., 31 st  March 2025.     The financial statements of the Company and its  subsidiary companies are combined on a line-by- line basis by adding together of like-items of assets,  liabilities, income and expenses, after eliminating  material intra-group balances and intra-group  transactions and resulting unrealised profits or  losses on intra-group transactions. Unrealised losses  are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains,  but only to the extent that there is no evidence  of impairment. 522 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   Functional and Presentation Currency:     The financial statements are presented in Indian  Rupees, which is the functional currency of the  Group and the currency of the primary economic  environment in which the Group operates and all  values are rounded to the nearest crore, upto 2  decimal places except otherwise indicated. B.   Material Accounting Policies: 1.1   Business Combination and Goodwill:     The Company uses the acquisition method of  accounting to account for business combinations.  The acquisition date is the date on which control is  transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in  determining the acquisition date and determining  whether control is transferred from one party to  another. Control exists when the Company is exposed  to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement  with the entity, and has the ability to affect those  returns through power over the entity. In assessing  control, potential voting rights are considered only if  the rights are substantive.     Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess  of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and  the amount recognised for non-controlling interests,  and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable  assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair  value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the  aggregate consideration transferred, the Company re- assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the  assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed, and  reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts  to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the re- assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of  net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration  transferred, then the gain is recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income (OCI), and accumulated in  other equity as capital reserve. However, if there is  no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity  recognises the gain directly in other equity as capital  reserve, without routing the same through OCI.     Consideration transferred includes the fair values  of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the  Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and  equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration  transferred also includes the fair value of any  contingent consideration. Consideration transferred  does not include amounts related to the settlement  of pre-existing relationships. Any goodwill that arises  on account of such business combination is tested  annually for impairment.     Any contingent consideration is measured at fair  value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay  contingent consideration that meets the definition  of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then  it is not remeasured and the settlement is accounted  for within other equity. Otherwise, other contingent  consideration is remeasured at fair value at each  reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair  value of the contingent consideration are recorded in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.     A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed  in a business combination only if such a liability  represents a present obligation and arises from a past  event, and its fair value can be measured reliably. On  an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company  recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree  either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s  proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable  net assets. Transaction costs that the Company  incurs in connection with a business combination,  such as Stamp Duty for title transfer in the name of  the Company, finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence  fees, and other professional and consulting fees, are  expensed as incurred and the services are received.     A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been  allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more  frequently, when there is an indication that the unit  may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the  cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount,  the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the  carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit  and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based  on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any  impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or  loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not  reversed in subsequent periods.     Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash- generating unit and part of the operation within that  unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the  disposed operation is included in the carrying amount  of the operation when determining the gain or loss on  disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is  measured based on the relative values of the disposed  operation and the portion of the cash-generating  unit retained. 523 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     If the initial accounting for a business combination is  incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which  the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional  amounts for the items for which the accounting is  incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted  through goodwill during the measurement period,  or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to  reflect new information obtained about facts and  circumstances that existed at the acquisition date  that, if known, would have affected the amounts  recognised at that date. These adjustments are  called as measurement period adjustments. The  measurement period does not exceed one year from  the acquisition date. 1.2     Classification of Assets and Liabilities as Current  and Non-Current:     All assets and liabilities are classified as current or  non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle  as per Ind AS 1 and other criteria set out in Division  II of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. Based  on the nature of products and the time lag between  the acquisition of assets for processing and their  realisation in cash and cash equivalents, 12 months  period has been considered by the Group as its normal  operating cycle. 1.3   Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):     On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to  continue with the carrying value of all its property  plant and equipment recognised as at 1 st  April 2015  measured as per the previous GAAP, and use that  carrying value as the deemed cost of the property,  plant and equipment.     Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition  or construction cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment loss. Freehold land is  stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses,  if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any  attributable cost of bringing the asset to its location  and working condition for its intended use, including  relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs  of decommissioning.     If significant parts of an item of PPE have different  useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate  items (major components) of PPE.     The cost of an item of PPE is recognised as an assets  if, and only if, it is probable that the economic benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Group in future  periods, and the cost of the item can be measured  reliably. Expenditure incurred after the PPE have been  put into operations, such as repairs and maintenance  expenses, are charged to the Statement of Profit and  Loss during the period in which they are incurred.     Items such as spare parts, standby equipment and  servicing equipment are recognised as PPE when it  is held for use in the production or supply of goods  or services, or for administrative purpose, and are  expected to be used for more than one year. Otherwise,  such items are classified as inventory.     An item of PPE is derecognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected to  arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain  or loss, arising on the disposal or retirement of an item  of PPE, is determined as the difference between the  sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset,  and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     Capital work-in-progress includes cost of property,  plant and equipment under installation/under  development as at the reporting date. 1.4    Treatment of Expenditure during Construction  Period:     Expenditure, net of income earned, during the  construction (including financing cost related to  borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of  qualifying PPE) period is included under capital  work-in-progress, and the same is allocated to the  respective PPE on the completion of construction.  Advances given towards acquisition or construction  of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are  disclosed as Capital Advances under “Other Non- Current Assets”. 1.5   Depreciation:     Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the  depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, and  is provided on a straight-line basis, except for Viscose  Staple Fibre Division (excluding Power Plants), Nagda,  and Corporate Finance Division, Mumbai, for which  it is provided on written down value method, over  the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the  Companies Act, 2013, or as per technical assessment.     Depreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less  its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is  524 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 the period over which PPE is expected to be available  for use by the Group, or the number of production or  similar units expected to be obtained from the asset  by the Group.     Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore  is not depreciated.     Improvements undertaken over the leasehold  properties are depreciated over the earlier of the  useful life of the asset or the end of the lease term.     The Group has used the following useful lives of the  property, plant and equipment to provide depreciation.   A.     Maj or assets class where useful life  considered as provided in Schedule II: S.  No. Nature of Assets Estimated  Useful Life of  the Assets 1. Plant and Machinery - Continuous  Process Plant 25 years 2. Reactors 3 years 3. Vessel/Storage Tanks 20 years 4. Factory Buildings 30 years 5. Buildings (other than Factory Buildings)  RCC Frame Structures 60 years 6. Electric Installations and Equipment    (at Factory) 10 years 7.

Railway Sidings 15 years 10. -    Carpeted Roads- Reinforced Cement  Concrete (RCC) - Carpeted Roads- other than RCC - Non-Carpeted Roads 10 years 5 years 3 years 11. Fences, wells, tube wells 5 years     In case of certain class of assets, the Group uses  different useful life than those prescribed in Schedule  II of the Companies Act, 2013. The useful life has  been assessed based on technical advice, taking  into account the nature of the asset, the estimated  usage of the asset on the basis of the Management’s  best estimation of getting economic benefits from  those classes of assets. The Group uses its technical  expertise along with historical and industry trends for  arriving the economic life of an asset.     Also, useful life of the part of PPE which is significant  to the total cost of PPE, has been separately assessed,  and depreciation has been provided accordingly.   B.     Ass ets where useful life differs from    Schedule II: S.  No. Nature of Assets Useful Life as  Prescribed by  Schedule II of  the Companies  Act, 2013 Estimated  Useful Life of  the Assets 1.

Continuous process plants, as defined in Schedule II  of the Companies Act, 2013, have been classified on  the basis of technical assessment, and depreciation  is provided accordingly.     Depreciation on additions is provided on a pro- rata basis from the month of installation or  acquisition and, in case of a new Project, from the  date of commencement of commercial production.  Depreciation on deductions/disposals is provided on  a pro-rata basis upto the month preceding the month  of deduction/disposal. 525 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 1.6     Intangible Assets Acquired Separately and  Amortisation:     On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to  continue with the carrying value of all its Intangible  Assets recognised as at 1 st  April 2015 measured as  per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as  the deemed cost of the Intangible Assets.     Intangible assets acquired separately are measured  on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible  assets acquired in a business combination is their  fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial  recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less  any accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any.     Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over  the useful economic life and assessed for impairment,  whenever there is an indication that the intangible  asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and  the amortisation method for an intangible asset with  a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end  of each reporting period. Changes in the expected  useful life or the expected pattern of consumption  of future economic benefits embodied in the asset  are considered to modify the amortisation period or  method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes  in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense  on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss, unless such  expenditure forms part of carrying value of another  asset. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives.     Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not  amortised, but are tested for impairment annually,  either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.  The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually  to determine whether the indefinite life continues to  be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from  indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.     Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an  intangible asset are measured as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the  carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss, when the asset  is derecognised.     Intangible Assets and their Useful Lives are as  under: S.  No. Nature of Assets Estimated Useful Life of the  Assets 1. Computer Software 2 - 6 years 2. Trademarks, Technical  Know-how 5 - 10 years 3. Value of Licence/ Right-to-Use  Infrastructure 10 years 4. Mining Rights Over the period of the  respective mining agreement 5. Mining Reserve On the basis of material  extraction (proportion of  material extracted per annum  to total mining reserve) 6. Jetty Rights Over the period of the  relevant agreement such that  the cumulative amortisation  is not less than the  cumulative rebate availed by  the Group 7. Customer Relationship 15 - 25 years 8. Brands 10 years 9. Distribution Network  (inclusive of Branch/ Franchise/Agency  Network and  Relationship) 5 - 25 years 10. Right to Manage  and Operate  Manufacturing Facility 15 years 11.

Surface Rights Over the period of respective  mining agreement 1.7     Internally Generated Intangible Assets - Research  and Development Expenditure:     Revenue expenditure on research is expensed under  the respective heads of the account in the period  in which it is incurred. Development expenditure is  capitalised as an asset, if the following conditions can  be demonstrated:   a)     The technical feasibility of completing the asset  so that it can be made available for use or sell.   b)     The Group has intention to complete the asset  and use or sell it.   c)     In cas e of intention to sale, the Group has the  ability to sell the asset. 526 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   d)   The future economic benefits are probable.   e)     The G roup has ability to measure the  expenditure attributable to the asset during its  development reliably.     Other development costs, which do not meet the  above criteria, are expensed out during the period in  which they are incurred.     PPE procured for research and development activities  are capitalised. 1.8     Discontinued Operations and Non-Current Assets  (or Disposal Groups) Classified as Held for Sale:     A discontinued operation is a component of the group’s  business, the operations and cash flows of which can  be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the  group and which represent a separate major line of  business or geographical area of operations and   •     Is a part of single co-ordinated plan to dispose of  a separate major line of business or geographical  area of operations; or   •     Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to  re-sale.     Classification as a discontinued operation occurs  upon disposal or when the operation meets the  criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.     When an operation is classified as a discontinued  operation, the comparative Statement of Profit and  Loss is represented as if the operation had been  discontinued from the start of the comparative period.     Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified  as held for sale, if their carrying amount is intended to  be recovered principally through a sale (rather than  through continuing use), when the asset (or disposal  group) is available for immediate sale in its present  condition subject only to terms that are usual and  customary for sale of such asset (or disposal group),  and the sale is highly probable and is expected to  qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one  year from the date of classification.     Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as  held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying  amount and fair value less costs to sell. 1.9   Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:     At the end of each reporting period, the Group  reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets  to determine whether there is any indication that  those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any  such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the  asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of  the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible  to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual  asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of  the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation  can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated  to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they  are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating  units, for which a reasonable and consistent allocation  basis can be identified.     Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and  intangible assets not yet available for use are tested  for impairment at least annually, and whenever there  is an indication then the asset may be impaired.     Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less  costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing  the value in use, the estimated future cash flows  are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset, for which the estimates of future  cash flows have not been adjusted.     If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying  amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash- generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the  Statement of Profit and Loss, unless the relevant asset  is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the  impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.     When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the  carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating  unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its  recoverable amount, but, so that, the increased  carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount  that would have been determined had no impairment  loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating  unit) in the prior years. A reversal of an impairment  loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of  Profit and Loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at  a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the  impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. 527 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 1.10   Inventories:     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realisable value. on item-by-item basis.     Net realisable value for inventories is the estimated  selling price in the ordinary course of business, less  estimated costs of completion and the estimated  costs necessary to make the sale.     Raw materials, stores and spare parts, and packing  materials are considered to be realisable at cost,  if the finished products, in which they will be used,  are expected to be sold at or above cost. The cost is  computed on weighted-average basis, which includes  expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like  purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit)  and other costs incurred in bringing the inventory to  the present location and condition.     Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress includes  the cost of conversion based on normal capacity and  other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition. Cost of stock- in-trade includes cost of purchase and other costs  incurred in bringing the inventories to the present  location and condition. The cost of finished goods,  work-in-progress and stock-in-trade is computed on  weighted-average basis.     In the absence of cost, waste/scrap is valued at  estimated net realisable value.     Obsolete, defective, slow moving and unserviceable  inventories, if any, are duly provided for.     Proceeds, in respect of sale of raw materials/stores,  are credited to the respective heads. 1.11   Product Classification of Insurance Business     Insurance contracts are those contracts when  the Group (the insurer) has accepted significant  insurance risk from another party (the policyholders)  by agreeing to compensate the policyholders, if a  specified uncertain future event (the insured event)  adversely affects the policyholders. As a general  guideline, the Group determines whether it has  significant insurance risk, if the benefit payable on  death is higher by at least 5% of the fund value at any  time during the term of the contract for unit - linked  products, or the benefit payable on death is higher by  at least 5% of the premium at any time during the term  of the contract for other than unit-linked products.  Investment contracts are those contracts which are  not Insurance Contracts. 1.12   Cash and Cash Equivalents:     Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise cash on hand  and cash at bank including fixed deposits with original  maturity period of three months or less and short-term  highly liquid investments with an original maturity of  three months or less. 1.13   Cash Flow Statement:     Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby the net profit before tax is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any  deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash  receipts or payments and item of income or expenses  associated with investing or financing cash flows. The  cash flows from operating, investing and financing  activities of the Group are segregated. 1.14   Employee Benefits:   Short-Term Employee Benefits:     Short-term employee benefits are recognised as an  expense on accrual basis.   Defined Contribution Plans:     Contribution payable to the recognised Provident  Fund and approved Superannuation Scheme, which  are substantially defined contribution plans, is  recognised as expense in the Statement of Profit and  Loss, when employees have rendered the service  entitling them to the contribution.     The Provident Fund contribution as specified  under the law is paid to the Regional Provident  Fund Commissioner.   Defined Benefit Plans:     The obligation in respect of defined benefit plans,  which covers Gratuity, Pension and other post- employment medical benefits, are provided for on  the basis of an actuarial valuation at the end of each  financial year, using project unit credit method.  Gratuity is funded with an approved Trust.     In respect of certain employees, Provident Fund  contributions are made to a Trust, administered by  the Group. The interest rate payable to the members  of the Trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate  528 Grasim Industries Limited

The Group’s liability is actuarially  determined (using the Projected Unit Credit Method)  at the end of the year, and any shortfall in the Fund  size, maintained by the Trust set-up by the Group, is  additionally provided for.     Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and  losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling  (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding  net interest), is reflected immediately in the Balance  Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in OCI in the  period in which they occur.     Remeasurement recognised in OCI is reflected  immediately in retained earnings and will not be re- classified to profit or loss in the Statement of Profit  and Loss, except with respect to life insurance  business which relates to restricted life insurance  fund relating to Revenue Account of Life Insurance  Policyholders, the same has been transferred under  “Life insurance contract liabilities and other financial  liabilities of the life insurance fund” in the Balance  Sheet, and the same will not be reclassified to revenue  account of insurance business. Defined benefit costs  are categorised as follows:   •     service cost (including current service cost,  past service cost, as well as gains and losses on  curtailments and settlements);   •   net i nterest expense or income; and   •   Rem easurement.     The Group presents the first two components of  defined benefit costs in the statement of Profit and  Loss in the line item ‘Employee Benefits Expense’.     The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is  calculated using a discount rate, which is determined  by reference to market yields at the end of the  reporting period on government bonds.     The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the  Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus  in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus  resulting from this calculation is limited to the present  value of any economic benefits available in the form  of refunds from the plans or reductions in the future  contribution to the plans.   Other Employee Benefits:     A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to  employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual  leave and sick leave in the period the related service  is rendered.     Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term  employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted  amount of the benefits expected to be paid in  exchange for the related service.     Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term  employee benefits are measured using the projected  unit credit method by a qualified independent actuary  at the end of each annual reporting period, at the  present value of the estimated future cash outflows  expected to be made by the Group, in respect of  services provided by employees up to the reporting  date. Remeasurement gains/losses are recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which  they arise.   Compensated Absences:     The Compensated Absences cover the Company’s  liability for earned and sick leaves. The compensated  absences are provided for on the basis of an actuarial  valuation at the end of each financial year. Total  liability related to this is presented as current, since  the Company does not have an unconditional right  to defer its settlement. Actuarial gains/losses, if  any, are recognised immediately in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss. 1.15   Employee Share Based Payments:   Equity-Settled Transactions:     Equity-settled share-based payments to employees  are measured by reference to the fair value of the  equity instruments at the grant date using Black- Scholes Model and Binomial Model.     The fair value, determined at the grant date of the  equity-settled share-based payments, is charged  to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic  basis over the vesting period of the option, based  on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that  will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in  other equity.     At the end of each reporting period, the Company  revises its estimate of the number of equity  instruments expected to vest.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss, such that the  cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate,  with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled  employee benefits reserve.     In case of forfeiture/lapse stock option, which is not  vested, amortised portion is reversed by credit to  employee compensation expense. In a situation where  the stock option expires unexercised, the related  balance standing to the credit of the Employee Stock  Options Outstanding Account is transferred within  other equity.   Cash-Settled Transactions:     The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured  initially at fair value at the grant date using a Black-  Scholes Merton Formula. This fair value is expensed  over the period until the vesting date with recognition  of a corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured  to fair value at each reporting date upto and, including  the settlement date, with changes in fair value  recognised in employee benefits expense. 1.16   Treasury Shares:     The Company has created an Employee Benefit  Trust (EBT) for providing share-based payment to its  employees. The Company uses EBT as a vehicle for  distributing shares to employees under the Employee  Stock Options Scheme. The EBT purchase shares of  the Company from the market, for giving shares to  employees. The Company treats EBT as its extension  and shares held by EBT are treated as treasury shares.     Own equity instruments that are re-acquired (treasury  shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from  other equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss on the purchase, sale,  issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity  instruments. Share options, whenever exercised,  would be settled from such treasury shares.     1.17   Foreign Currency Transactions:     In preparing the financial statements of the Group,  transactions in foreign currencies, other than the  Group’s functional currency, are recognised at the  rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the  transactions. At the end of each reporting period,  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at  that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in  terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not  re-translated.     Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the  period in which these arise, except for:   •     exch ange differences on foreign currency  borrowings relating to assets under construction  for future productive use, which are included in  the cost of those assets when they are regarded  as an adjustment to interest costs on those  foreign currency borrowings;   •     exchange differences relating to qualifying  effective cash flow hedges; and   •     exchange difference arising on restatement of  long-term monetary items that in substance  forms part of Group’s net investment in foreign  operations, is accumulated in Foreign Currency  Translation Reserve (component of OCI) until  the disposal of the investment, at which time  such exchange difference is recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 1.18   Foreign Operations:     The assets and liabilities of foreign operations,  including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising  on acquisition, are translated into Indian Rupees, the  functional currency of the Group, at the exchange  rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses  of foreign operations are translated into Indian Rupee  at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions  or an average rate, if the average rate approximates the  actual rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange  differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in  other equity (as exchange differences on translating  the financial statements of a foreign operation),  except to the extent that the exchange differences  are allocated to non-controlling interest.     When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety  or partially such that control, significant influence  or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of  exchange differences related to that foreign operation  recognised in OCI, is re-classified to the Statement of  Profit and Loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If  the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary,  but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the  cumulative amount of foreign exchange differences is  re-allocated to NCI. When the Group disposes of only  a part of its interest in an Associate or a Joint Venture,  530 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 while retaining significant influence or joint control,  the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount  of foreign exchange differences is reclassified to the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 1.19    Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge  Accounting:     The Group enters into forward contracts to hedge  the foreign currency risk of firm commitments and  highly probable forecast transactions. Derivatives  are initially recognised at fair value at the date  the derivative contracts are entered into, and are  subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the  end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or  loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  immediately, unless the derivative is designated and  effective as a hedging instrument, in which event  the timing of the recognition in the Statement of  Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedging  relationship and the nature of the hedged item.     The Group enters into derivative financial instruments,  viz., foreign exchange forward contracts, interest  rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage  its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange  rate risks and commodity prices. The Group does  not hold derivative financial instruments for  speculative purposes.   Hedge Accounting:     The Group designates certain hedging instruments  in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk  and commodity price risk as cash flow hedges. At the  inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally  designates and documents the hedge relationship to  which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting  and the risk management objective and strategy for  undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes  the Group’s risk management objective and strategy  for undertaking hedge, the hedging/economic  relationship, the hedged item or transaction, the  nature of the risk being hedged, hedge ratio and how  the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in  the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the  exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value  or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such  hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving  offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows, and  are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that  they actually have been highly effective throughout  the financial reporting periods, for which they  were designated.     The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the  designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash  flow hedges is recognised in OCI and accumulated  under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve.  The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is  recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.     Amounts previously recognised in other  comprehensive income and accumulated in other  equity relating to (effective portion as described  above) are reclassified to the Statement of Profit and  Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects  profit or loss. However, when the hedged forecast  transaction results in the recognition of a non- financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains  and losses are transferred from equity and included  in the initial measurement of the cost of the non- financial asset or non-financial liability.     Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised,  without replacement or rollover (as part of the hedging  strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked,  or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated  in other equity at that time remains in other equity,  and is recognised when the forecast transaction  is ultimately recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer  expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated  in other equity is recognised immediately in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 1.20   Fair Value Measurement:     The Group measures financial instruments, such  as investments (other than equity investments in  Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates) and  derivatives at fair values at each Balance Sheet date.     Fair value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. The fair value measurement is  based on the presumption that the transaction to sell  the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:     In the principal market for the asset or liability, or  In the absence of a principal market, in the most  advantageous market for the asset or liability. 531 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     The principal or the most advantageous market must  be accessible by the Group.     The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured  using the assumptions that market participants  would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming  that market participants act in their economic  best interest.     A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset  takes into account a market participant’s ability to  generate economic benefits by using the asset in its  highest and best use or by selling it to another market  participant that would use the asset in its highest and  best use.     The Group uses valuation techniques that are  appropriate in the circumstances and for which  sufficient data are available to measure fair value,  maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and  minimising the use of unobservable inputs.     All assets and liabilities (for which fair value is  measured or disclosed in the financial statements) are  categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described  as follows, based on the lowest level input that is  significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:     Level 1 —  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities.     Level 2 —  Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is directly or indirectly observable other  than quoted prices included in Level 1.     Level 3 —  Valuation techniques for which the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement is unobservable.     For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the  financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group  determines whether transfers have occurred between  levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation  (based on the lowest level input that is significant to  the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of  each reporting period.     The Management determines the policies and  procedures for both recurring fair value measurement,  such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial  assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring  measurement, such as assets held for disposal in  discontinued operations.     At each reporting date, the Management analyses  the movements in the values of assets and liabilities,  which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as  per the Group’s accounting policies. For this analysis,  the Management verifies the major inputs applied in  the latest valuation by agreeing the information in  the valuation computation to contracts and other  relevant documents. 1.21   Financial Instruments:     A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise  to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability  or equity instrument of another entity.   Financial Assets:   Initial Recognition and Measurement:     All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value.  However, in the case of financial assets not recorded  at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs  that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial  asset are added to the fair value. However, trade  receivables that do not contain a significant financing  component are measured at transaction price (net of  variable consideration). Purchases or sales of financial  assets that require delivery of assets within a time  frame established by regulation or convention in the  marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on  the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits  to purchase or sell the asset.   Subsequent Measurement:     For the purposes of subsequent measurement,  financial assets are classified in four categories:   •   Deb t instruments at amortised cost   •     Deb t instruments at Fair Value through Other  Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)   •     Deb t instruments, derivatives and equity  instruments, mutual funds at Fair Value through  Profit or Loss (FVTPL)   •   Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI   Debt Instruments at Amortised Cost:     A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at amortised cost, if  both the following conditions are met: 532 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   a)     The  asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for collecting  contractual cash flows; and   b)     Con tractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the  principal amount outstanding.     After initial measurement, such financial assets are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost  is calculated by taking into account any discount or  premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are  an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is  included in finance income in the profit or loss. The  losses arising from impairment are recognised in the  profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade  and other receivables.   Debt Instrument at FVTOCI:     A ‘debt instrument’ is classified at FVTOCI, if both of  the following criteria are met:   a)     The objective of the business model is achieved  both by collecting contractual cash flows and  selling the financial assets; and   b)     The asset’s contractual cash flows represent  SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.     Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI  category are measured initially as well as at each  reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are  recognised in the OCI. However, the Group recognises  interest income, impairment losses and reversals,  and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement  of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of the asset,  cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is  reclassified from the equity to the Statement of Profit  and Loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt  instrument is reported as interest income using the  EIR method.   Debt Instrument at FVTPL:     FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any  debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for  categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is  classified as at FVTPL.     In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt  instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or  FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election  is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a  measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred  to as ‘accounting mismatch’).     Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category  are measured at fair value with all changes recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except for changes  with respect to Policyholders’ investments under the  life insurance business (except for assets held to  cover linked-liabilities) relating to Revenue Account  of Life Insurance Policyholders, wherein the fair  value movements are included under “Life insurance  contract liabilities and other financial liabilities of the  life insurance fund” in the Balance Sheet.     Interest Income from these financial assets are  recognised is included in Other Income in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.   Equity Investments:     Investments in Associates and Joint ventures are out  of scope of Ind AS 109, and it is accounted as per Ind  AS 28.     All other equity investments are measured at fair  value. Equity instruments, which are held for trading,  are classified as at FVTPL. For equity instruments,  other than held for trading, the Group has irrevocable  option to present in OCI subsequent changes in the  fair value. The Group makes such election on an  instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is  made on initial recognition, and is irrevocable.     Where the Group classifies equity instruments as at  FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument,  excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There  is no recycling of the amounts of profit or loss from  OCI to the Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale  of investment.     Equity instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss,  except for changes with respect to Policyholders’  investments under the life insurance business (except  for assets held to cover linked-liabilities) relating to  Revenue Account of Life Insurance Policyholders,  wherein the fair value movements are included  under “Life insurance contract liabilities and other  financial liabilities of the life insurance fund” in the  Balance Sheet. 533 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   Impairment of Financial Assets:     The Group recognises loss allowances for ECLs on the  following financial instruments that are not measured  at FVTPL:   •   Loans and advances to customers;   •   Deb t investment securities;   •   Trade and other receivables;   •   Lease receivables;   •   Irre vocable loan commitments issued; and   •   Financial guarantee contracts issued.     With the exception of POCI financial assets (which are  considered separately below), ECLs are required to  be measured through a loss allowance at an amount  equal to:   •     12-month ECL, i.e., that result from those default  events on the financial instrument that are  possible within 12 months after the reporting  date (referred to as Stage 1); or   •     full lifetime ECL, i.e., that result from all possible  default events over the life of the financial  instrument (referred to as Stage 2 and Stage 3).     A loss allowance for full lifetime ECL is required for a  financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial  instrument has increased significantly since initial  recognition (and consequently for credit impaired  financial assets). For all other financial instruments,  ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the  12-month ECL.     The Group’s policy is always to measure loss  allowances for lease receivables as lifetime ECL.     ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of the  present value of credit losses. These are measured  as the present value of the difference between the  cash flows due to the Group under the contract and  the cash flows that the Group expects to receive  arising from the weighting of multiple future economic  scenarios, discounted at the asset’s EIR.   •     for undrawn loan commitments, the ECL is the  difference between the present value of the  difference between the contractual cash flows  that are due to the Group, if the holder of the  commitment draws down the loan, and the cash  flows that the Group expects to receive if the  loan is drawn down; and   •     for financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the  difference between the expected payments to  reimburse the holder of the guaranteed debt  instrument less any amounts that the Group  expects to receive from the holder, the debtor or  any other party.     The Group measures ECL on an individual basis,  or on a collective basis for portfolios of loans that  share similar economic risk characteristics. The  measurement of the loss allowance is based on the  present value of the asset’s expected cash flows using  the asset’s original EIR, regardless of whether it is  measured on an individual basis or a collective basis.   Credit-Impaired Financial Assets:     A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or  more events that have a detrimental impact on the  estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have  occurred. Credit-impaired financial assets are referred  to as Stage 3 assets. Evidence of credit-impairment  includes observable data about the following events:   •     significant financial difficulty of the borrower  or issuer;   •     a bre ach of contract such as a default or past  due event;   •     the lender of the borrower, for economic or  contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s  financial difficulty, having granted to the  borrower a concession that the lender would not  otherwise consider;   •     the disappearance of an active market for a  security because of financial difficulties; or   •     the purchase of a financial asset at a deep  discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.     It may not be possible to identify a single discrete  event—instead, the combined effect of several  events may have caused financial assets to become  credit-impaired. The Group assesses whether debt  instruments that are financial assets measured  at amortised cost or FVTOCI are credit-impaired  at each reporting date. To assess if corporate debt  534 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 instruments are credit impaired, the Group considers  factors such as bond yields, credit ratings and the  ability of the borrower to raise funding.     A loan is considered credit-impaired when a  concession is granted to the borrower due to a  deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition,  unless there is evidence that as a result of granting the  concession the risk of not receiving the contractual  cash flows has reduced significantly, and there are no  other indicators of impairment. For financial assets  where concessions are contemplated but not granted,  the asset is deemed credit impaired when there is  observable evidence of credit-impairment, including  meeting the definition of default. The definition  of default (see below) includes unlikeliness to pay  indicators and a back-stop, if amounts are overdue  for 90 days or more.     Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired (POCI)  Financial Assets:     POCI financial assets are treated differently because  the asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition.  For these assets, the Group recognises all changes  in lifetime ECL since initial recognition as a loss  allowance with any changes recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. A favorable change for  such assets creates an impairment gain.   Definition of Default:     Critical to the determination of ECL is the definition of  default. The definition of default is used in measuring  the amount of ECL and in the determination of whether  the loss allowance is based on 12-month or lifetime  ECL, as default is a component of the probability of  default (PD), which affects both the measurement of  ECLs and the identification of a significant increase in  credit risk.     The Group considers the following as constituting an  event of default:   •     the borrower is past due more than 90 days on  any material credit obligation to the Group; or   •     the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit  obligations to the Group in full.     The definition of default is appropriately tailored to  reflect different characteristics of different types  of assets.     When assessing if the borrower is unlikely to pay  its credit obligation, the Group takes into account  both qualitative and quantitative indicators. The  information assessed depends on the type of the  asset, for example, in corporate lending a qualitative  indicator used is the admittance of bankruptcy  petition by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT),  which is not relevant for retail lending. Quantitative  indicators, such as overdue status and non-payment  on another obligation of the same counterparty, are  key inputs in this analysis. The Group uses a variety  of sources of information to assess default, which  are either developed internally or obtained from  external sources. The definition of default is applied  consistently to all financial instruments, unless  information becomes available that demonstrates  that another default definition is more appropriate  for a particular financial instrument.   Significant Increase in Credit Risk:     The Group monitors all financial assets, issued  irrevocable loan commitments and financial  guarantee contracts that are subject to the  impairment requirements to assess whether there has  been a significant increase in credit risk since initial  recognition. If there has been a significant increase in  credit risk, the Group will measure the loss allowance  based on lifetime rather than 12-month ECL. The  Group’s accounting policy is not to use the practical  expedient that financial assets with ‘low’ credit risk  at the reporting date are deemed not to have had  a significant increase in credit risk. As a result, the  Group monitors all financial assets, issued irrevocable  loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts  that are subject to impairment for significant increase  in credit risk.     In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial  instrument has increased significantly since initial  recognition, the Group compares the risk of a  default occurring on the financial instrument at the  reporting date based on the remaining maturity of the  instrument with the risk of a default occurring that  was anticipated for the remaining maturity at the  current reporting date when the financial instrument  was first recognised. In making this assessment, the  Group considers both quantitative and qualitative  information that is reasonable and supportable,  including historical experience and forward-looking  information that is available without undue cost or  effort, based on the Group’s historical experience and  expert credit assessment. 535 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Given that a significant increase in credit risk since  initial recognition is a relative measure, a given  change, in absolute terms, in the probability of default  (PD) will be more significant for a financial instrument  with a lower initial PD than compared to a financial  instrument with a higher PD.   Modification and Derecognition of Financial Assets:     A modification of a financial asset occurs when  the contractual terms governing the cash flows  of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise  modified between initial recognition and maturity  of the financial asset. A modification affects the  amount and/or timing of the contractual cash flows  either immediately or at a future date. In addition, the  introduction or adjustment of existing covenants of  an existing loan may constitute a modification even  if these new or adjusted covenants do not yet affect  the cash flows immediately, but may affect the cash  flows depending on whether the covenant is or is not  met (e.g., a change to the increase in the interest rate  that arises when covenants are breached).     The Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial  difficulty to maximise collection and minimise the  risk of default. A loan forbearance is granted in cases  where, although, the borrower made all reasonable  efforts to pay under the original contractual terms,  there is a high risk of default or default has already  happened and the borrower is expected to be able to  meet the revised terms. The revised terms in most of  the cases include an extension of the maturity of the  loan, changes to the timing of the cash flows of the  loan (principal and interest repayment), reduction in  the amount of cash flows due (principal and interest  forgiveness) and amendments to covenants.     When a financial asset is modified, the Group  assesses whether this modification results in  derecognition. In accordance with the Group’s policy  a modification results in derecognition when it gives  rise to substantially different terms. To determine if  the modified terms are substantially different from  the original contractual terms, the Group considers  the following:   •     Qua litative factors, such as contractual cash  flows after modification, are no longer SPPI   •   change in currency or change of counterparty   •     the extent of change in interest rates,  maturity, covenants   •     If these do not clearly indicate a substantial  modification, then     In the case where the financial asset is derecognised  the loss allowance for ECL is remeasured at the date of  derecognition to determine the net carrying amount  of the asset at that date. The difference between this  revised carrying amount and the fair value of the new  financial asset with the new terms will lead to a gain  or loss on derecognition. The new financial asset will  have a loss allowance measured based on 12-month,  ECL except in the rare occasions where the new  loan is considered to be originated-credit impaired.  This applies only in the case where the fair value of  the new loan is recognised at a significant discount  to its revised par amount, because there remains a  high risk of default which has not been reduced by  the modification. The Group monitors credit risk of  modified financial assets by evaluating qualitative and  quantitative information, such as if the borrower is in  past due status under the new terms.     When the contractual terms of a financial asset are  modified and the modification does not result in  derecognition, the Group determines if the financial  asset’s credit risk has increased significantly since  initial recognition by comparing:   •     the remaining lifetime PD estimated based  on data at initial recognition and the original  contractual terms; with   •     the remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date  based on the modified terms.     For financial assets modified, where modification  did not result in derecognition, the estimate of PD  reflects the Group’s ability to collect the modified  cash flows taking into account the Group’s previous  experience of similar forbearance action, as well  as various behavioural indicators, including the  borrower’s payment performance against the  modified contractual terms. If the credit risk remains  significantly higher than what was expected at initial  recognition the loss allowance will continue to be  measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. The  loss allowance on forborne loans will generally only  be measured based on 12-month ECL when there  is evidence of the borrower’s improved repayment  behaviour following modification leading to a reversal  of the previous significant increase in credit risk. 536 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Where a modification does not lead to derecognition  the Group calculates the modification gain/loss  comparing the gross carrying amount before and  after the modification (excluding the ECL allowance).  Then the Group measures ECL for the modified asset,  where the expected cash flows arising from the  modified financial asset are included in calculating  the expected cash shortfalls from the original asset.     The Group derecognises a financial asset only when  the contractual rights to the asset’s cash flows expire  (including expiry arising from a modification with  substantially different terms), or when the financial  asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership of the asset are transferred to another  entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  and continues to control the transferred asset, the  Group recognises its retained interest in the asset  and an associated liability for amounts it may have to  pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset,  the Group continues to recognise the financial asset  and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the  proceeds received.     On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety,  the difference between the asset’s carrying amount  and the sum of the consideration received and  receivable and the cumulative gain/loss that had  been recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss,  with the exception of equity investment designated  as measured at FVTOCI, where the cumulative gain/ loss previously recognised in OCI is not subsequently  reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.     On derecognition of a financial asset other than in  its entirety (e.g., when the Group retains an option  to repurchase part of a transferred asset), the  Group allocates the previous carrying amount of  the financial asset between the part it continues to  recognise under continuing involvement, and the part  it no longer recognises on the basis of the relative fair  values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The  difference between the carrying amount allocated  to the part that is no longer recognised and the sum  of the consideration received for the part no longer  recognised and any cumulative gain/loss allocated  to it that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss. A cumulative gain/ loss that had been recognised in OCI is allocated  between the part that continues to be recognised and  the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of  the relative fair values of those parts. This does not  apply for equity investments designated as measured  at FVTOCI, as the cumulative gain/loss previously  recognised in OCI is not subsequently reclassified to  the Statement of Profit and Loss.   Write off:     Loans and debt securities are written off when the  Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering  the financial asset (either in its entirety or a portion  of it). This is the case when the Group determines  that the borrower does not have assets or sources of  income that could generate sufficient cash flows to  repay the amounts subject to the write-off. A write- off constitutes a derecognition event. The Group  may apply enforcement activities to financial assets  written off. Recoveries resulting from the Group’s  enforcement activities will result in impairment gains.     Presentation of Allowance for ECL in the Balance  Sheet:     Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the Balance  Sheet as follows:   •     for financial assets measured at amortised cost:  as a deduction from the gross carrying amount  of the assets;   •     for debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: no  loss allowance is recognised in the Balance Sheet  as the carrying amount is at fair value where a  financial instrument includes both a drawn and  an undrawn component, and the Group cannot  identify the ECL on the loan commitment  component separately from those on the drawn  component: The Group presents a combined loss  allowance for both components. The combined  amount is presented as a deduction from the  gross carrying amount of the drawn component.   Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments:   Classification as Debt or Equity:     Debt and equity instruments, issued by the Group,  are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity,  in accordance with the substance of the contractual  arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability  and an equity instrument. 537 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   Equity Instruments:     An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  a residual interest in the assets of the Group after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments  issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds  received, net of direct issue costs.   Financial Liabilities:     Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition  as fair value through profit or loss:   •   Loans and borrowings,   •   Pay ables, or   •     as derivatives designated as hedging instruments  in an effective hedge, as appropriate.     All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair  value, and in the case of loans and borrowings, and  payables are recognised net of directly attributable  transaction costs.     The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and  other payables, loans and borrowings, including  bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and  derivative financial instruments.   Subsequent Measurement:     The measurement of financial liabilities depends on  their classification, as described below:   Financial Liabilities at FVTPL:     Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities  held for trading and financial liabilities designated  upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial  liabilities are classified as held for trading, if they  are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the  near term. This category also includes derivative  financial instruments entered into by the Group, that  are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge  relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated  embedded derivatives are also classified as held  for trading, unless they are designated as effective  hedging instruments.     Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     Financial liabilities, designated upon initial recognition  at FVTPL, are designated as such at the initial date  of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109  are satisfied.   Loans and Borrowings:     After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and  borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised  cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.  Gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss, when the liabilities are derecognised  as well as through the EIR amortisation process.     Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account  any discount or premium on acquisition and fees  or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The  EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.   Financial Guarantee Contracts:     Financial guarantee contracts, issued by the Group,  are those contracts that require a payment to be made  to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs, because the  specified debtor fails to make a payment when due,  in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.  Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially  as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs  that are directly attributable to the issuance of the  guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at  the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined  as per the impairment requirements of Ind AS 109, and  the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.   Derecognition of Financial Liabilities:     The Group derecognises financial liabilities when and  only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,  cancelled or have expired. The difference between the  carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised  and the consideration paid and payable is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.   Embedded Derivatives:     An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid  (combined) instrument, that also includes a non- derivative host contract – with the effect that some  of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a  way similar to a stand-alone derivative. An embedded  derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that  would otherwise be required by the contract to  be modified according to a specified interest rate,  financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign  exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or  538 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a  non-financial variable, that the variable is not specific  to a party to the contract. Re-assessment only occurs  if there is either a change in the terms of the contract  that significantly modifies the cash flows, that would  otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial  asset out of the fair value through profit or loss. If the  hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial  asset within the scope of Ind AS 109, the Company  does not separate the embedded derivatives. Rather,  it applies the classification requirements contained in  Ind AS 109 to the entire hybrid contract. Derivatives  embedded in all other host contracts are accounted  for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value,  if their economic characteristics and risks are not  closely related to those of the host contracts, and the  host contracts are not held for trading or designated  at fair value though profit or loss. These embedded  derivatives are measured at fair value with changes  in fair value recognised in profit or loss, unless  designated as effective hedging instruments.   Offsetting of Financial Instruments:     Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and  the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet, if  there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset  the recognised amounts and there is an intention to  settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle  the liabilities simultaneously. 1.22   Revenue Recognition:   (a)   Rev enue from Contracts with Customers:     •     Rev enue is recognised when the Company  satisfies a performance obligation on the  basis of approved contracts regarding the  transfer of goods or services to a customer.  This is achieved when control of the product  has been transferred to customer, which  generally occurs at a point in time.     •     The C ompany considers the terms of the  contract in determining the transaction  price. The transaction price is based upon the  amount the Company expects to be entitled  to in exchange for transferring of promised  goods and services to the customer after  deducting incentive programs, including but  not limited to discounts, volume rebates etc.  Transaction price excludes taxes and duties  collected on behalf of the government.     •     Var iable consideration - This includes  incentives, volume rebates, discounts,  etc. It is estimated at contract inception  considering the terms of various schemes  with customers and constrained until it is  highly probable that a significant revenue  reversal in the amount of cumulative  revenue recognised will not occur, when  the associated uncertainty with the  variable consideration is subsequently  resolved. It is re-assessed at the end of each  reporting period.     •     Sig nificant financing component - Generally,  the Company receives short-term advances  from its customers. Using the practical  expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company  does not adjust the promised amount of  consideration for the effects of a significant  financing component, if it expects, at  contract inception, that the period between  the transfer of the promised good or service  to the customer, and when the customer  pays for that good or service will be one year  or less.   (b)     Rev enue from services are recognised as they are  rendered based on agreements/arrangements  with the concerned parties and recognised net  of Service Tax or Goods and Service Tax (GST).   (c)     If only one service is identified, the Group  recognises revenue when the service is  performed. If an ongoing service is identified, as  a part of the agreement the period over which  revenue is recognised for that service generally  determined by the terms of agreement with the  customer. For practical purposes, where services  are performed by an indeterminate number of  acts over a specified period of time, revenue  is recognised on a straight-line basis over the  specified period, unless there is evidence that  some other method better represents the stage  of completion. When a specific act in much more  significant than any other acts, the recognition  of revenue is postponed until the significant act  is executed.   (d)     Div idend income is accounted for when the right  to receive the income is established.   (e)     For all financial instruments measured at amortised  cost or at fair value through Other Comprehensive  539 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Income, interest income is recorded using the  effective interest rate (EIR), which is the rate  that exactly discounts the estimated future cash  payments or receipts through the expected life  of the financial instrument to the gross carrying  amount of the financial asset.   (f)     Insu rance, railway and other claims, where quantum  of accruals cannot be ascertained with reasonable  certainty, are accounted on acceptance basis.     For Life Insurance Business, Revenue is Recognised  as follows:   Premium Income of Insurance Business:     Premium income on Insurance Contracts and  Investment Contracts with Discretionary Participative  Feature (DPF) is recognised as income when due from  policyholders. For unit-linked business, premium  income is recognised when the associated units are  created. Premium on lapsed policies is recognised as  income when such policies are re-instated. In case of  linked business, top-up premium paid by policyholders  are considered as single premium and are unitised  as prescribed by the regulations. This premium is  recognised when the associated units are created.     Fees and Commission Income of Insurance  Business:     Insurance and investment contract policyholders are  charged for policy administration services, investment  management services, surrenders and other contract  fees. These fees are recognised as revenue over the  period in which the related services are performed.  If the fees are for services provided in future periods,  then they are deferred and recognised over those  future periods.   Re-insurance Premium:     Re-insurance premium ceded is accounted for at  the time of recognition of the premium income in  accordance with the terms and conditions of the  relevant treaties with the re-insurers. Impact on  account of subsequent revisions to or cancellations of  premium is recognised in the year in which they occur.     Income from items other than to which Ind AS 109  Financial Instruments and Ind AS 104 Insurance  Contracts are applicable:     Revenue (other than for those items to which Ind  AS 109 Financial Instruments are applicable) is  measured at fair value of the consideration received  or receivable. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with  customers outlines a single comprehensive model  of accounting for revenue arising from contracts  with customers and supersedes current revenue  recognition guidance found within Ind ASs.     The Group recognises revenue from contracts with  customers based on a five-step model as set out in  Ind AS 115:     Step  1:  Identify contract(s) with a customer: A  contract is defined as an agreement between two  or more parties that creates enforceable rights and  obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract  that must be met.     Step  2:  Identify performance obligations in the  contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a  contract with a customer to transfer a good or service  to the customer.     Step  3:  Determine the transaction price: The  transaction price is the amount of consideration to  which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange  for transferring promised goods or services to a  customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of  third parties.     Step  4:  Allocate the transaction price to the  performance obligations in the contract: For a  contract that has more than one performance  obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price  to each performance obligation in an amount that  depicts the amount of consideration to which the  Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying  each performance obligation.      Step 5:  Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group  satisfies a performance obligation. 1.23   Leases:     The Group assesses whether a contract contains a  lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is,  or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right  to control the use of an identified asset for a period of  time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether  a contract conveys the right to control the use of an  identified asset, the Company assesses whether 540 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   •   the contract involves the use of identified asset;   •     the Company has substantially all of the  economic benefits from the use of the asset  through the period of lease; and   •     the Company has the right to direct the use of  the asset.   As a Lessee:     The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a  lease liability at the lease commencement date. The  right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which  comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for any lease payments made at or before  the commencement date, plus any initial direct  costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle  and remove the underlying asset or to restore the  underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less  any lease incentives received.     The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using the straight-line method from the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of the  useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the  lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use  assets are determined on the same basis as those of  property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use  asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if  any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the  lease liability.     The lease liability is initially measured at the present  value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be  readily determined, the Company’s incremental  borrowing rate. Generally, the company uses its  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.     Lease payments included in the measurement of the  lease liability comprise the following:   •     Fix ed payments, including in-substance  fixed payments;   •     Variable lease payments that depend on an index  or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate  as at the commencement date;   •     Amo unts expected to be payable under a residual  value guarantee; and   •     The exercise price under a purchase option that  the company is reasonably certain to exercise,  lease payments in an optional renewal period if  the company is reasonably certain to exercise  an extension option, and penalties for early  termination of a lease unless the company is  reasonably certain not to terminate early.     The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method. It is remeasured when  there is a change in future lease payments arising  from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change  in the company’s estimate of the amount expected  to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if  company changes its assessment of whether it will  exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.     When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero.   Short-Term Leases and Leases of Low-Value Assets     The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use  assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that  have a lease term of 12 months or lower, and leases of  low value assets. The Company recognises the lease  payments associated with these leases as an expense  on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   Leasehold Assets Depreciation: Leasehold Land and Buildings Over the period of Lease   Sale and Leaseback     The right of use arising from leaseback is measured  at the proportion of previous carrying amount of  the asset that relates to right of use retained by the  Company. Where sale proceeds received reflect the  asset’s fair value, any gain or loss arising on disposal  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss, to  the extent that it relates to the rights that have been  transferred. Gains and losses that relate to the rights  that have been retained are included in the carrying  amount of the right of use assets recognised at  commencement of the lease. Where sale proceeds  received are not at the asset’s fair value, any below  market terms are recognised as a prepayment of lease  payments, and above market terms are recognised as  additional financing provided by the lessor. 541 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 1.24   Contract Liability:       Contract liability is recognised when a payment  for customer is already received before a related  performance obligation is satisfied. If a customer  pays consideration before the Company transfers  goods or services to the customer, a contract liability  is recognised when the payment is received.     As these are contracts that the Company expects,  and has the ability, to fulfil through delivery of a  non-financial item, these are presented as advance  from customers, and are recognised as revenue  as and when control of respective commodities is  transferred or service is provided to the customers  under the agreements. 1.25   Benefits Paid (Including Claims):   Claims and Benefits Paid:     Gross benefits and claims for life insurance contracts  and for investment contracts with DPF include the  cost of all claims arising during the year including  internal and external claims handling costs that are  directly related to the processing and settlement of  claims, and policyholder bonuses declared on DPF  contracts as well as changes in the gross valuation  of insurance and investment contract liabilities  with DPF.     Death and other claims are accounted for, when  notified. Survival and maturity benefits are accounted  when due. Surrenders/Withdrawals under linked- policies are accounted in the respective schemes  when the associated units are cancelled. Repudiated  claims disputed before judicial authorities are  provided for based on the Management prudence  considering the facts and evidences available, in  respect of such claims.   Re-insurance Claims:     Re-insurance claims are recognised when the related  gross insurance claim is recognised according to the  terms of the relevant contract. 1.26   Acquisition Costs:     Acquisition costs are costs that vary with and are  primarily related to acquisition of insurance contracts.  Acquisition costs mainly consist of commission,  medical costs, policy printing expenses, stamp duty  and other related expenses. These costs are expensed  in the year in which they are incurred. Claw-back of  the first year commission paid, if any, in future is  accounted in the year in which it is recovered. 1.27   Policy Liabilities:   Insurance Contracts:     The policy liabilities are calculated in accordance  with the accepted actuarial practice, requirements  of Insurance Act, 1938, Regulations notified by the  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority  of India, and Practice Standards prescribed by the  Institute of Actuaries of India.   Investment Contracts:     Liability in respect on Investment Contracts  is recognised in accordance with IND AS 104  Insurance Contracts, taking into account accepted  actuarial practices. 1.28    Deferred Acquisition Cost (DAC)/Deferment  Origination Fees (DOF):     The Group has identified commission, rewards and  recognition paid to its agents pertaining to 1 st  year  as acquisition costs. Such acquisition costs are  amortised over the period of the policy contract.     The origination fees for Investment Contracts, being  premium allocation charges pertaining to the 1 st , 2 nd   and 3 rd  year, have been deferred over the period of the  policy contract.     Acquisition cost and origination fees is deferred only  for Investment Contracts. 1.29   Re-insurance Assets:     Re-insurance Asset, being net contractual rights  receivable under re-insurance contract, has been  recognised on the basis of Actuarial valuation. 1.30   Borrowing Costs:     Borrowing cost includes interest expense,  amortisation of discounts, hedge-related cost incurred  in connection with foreign currency borrowings,  ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing  of funds and exchange difference, arising from foreign  currency borrowings, to the extent they are regarded  as an adjustment to the interest cost.     Borrowing costs, that are attributable to the acquisition  or construction or production of a qualifying asset,  542 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till  such time the asset is ready for its intended use. A  qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a  substantial period of time to get ready for its intended  use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an  expense in the period in which they are incurred.     Investment income earned on the temporary  investment of specific borrowings, pending their  expenditure on qualifying assets, is deducted from the  borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. All other  borrowing costs are recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss in the period in which they are incurred. 1.31   Trade Receivable:     Trade receivables are held with the objective of  collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore  are subsequently measured at amortised cost less  loss allowance.     Trade receivables which are sold to a bank under  without-recourse factoring arrangement are de- recognised from the Balance Sheet. Under this  arrangement, the Company sell those receivables  for cash proceeds to the factor/bank and transfer  related risks and rewards – primarily credit risk. Trade  receivables which are sold under with-recourse  factoring arrangements for cash proceeds, are not  derecognised from the financial statements as the  Company retains substantially all of the risks and  rewards related to such trade receivables. The amount  received on sell of trade receivables under such  arrangements is recognised as a financial liability and  disclosed as short-term borrowings. 1.32   Government Grants and Subsidies:     Government grants are recognised when there is a  reasonable assurance that the same will be received  and all attached conditions will be complied with.  When the grant relates to an expense item, it is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss by way  of a deduction to the related expense on a systematic  basis over the periods that the related costs, for which  it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the  grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income on  a systematic basis over the expected useful life of the  related asset or in proportion to fulfillment of related  obligation. Government grants, that are receivable  towards capital investments under State Investment  Promotion Scheme, are recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss when they become receivable.     The benefit of a government loan at a below-market  rate of interest is treated as a government grant,  measured as the difference between proceeds  received and the fair value of the loan based on  prevailing market interest rates, and is being  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.     When the Group receives grants of non-monetary  assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair  value amounts and released to profit or loss over the  expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the  benefit of the underlying asset. 1.33   Exceptional Item:     Exception items include income or expense that are  considered to be part of ordinary activities, however,  are of such significance and nature that separate  disclosure enables the user of Financial Statements to  understand the impact in a more meaningful manner.  Exceptional items are identified by virtue of either  their size or nature so as to facilitate comparison with  prior periods and to assess underlying trends in the  financial performance of the Company. 1.34   Provision for Current and Deferred Tax:   Current Income Tax:     Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid  to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax  laws used to compute the amount are those that are  enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting  date, in the countries where the Group operates and  generates taxable income. Interest expenses are  included in finance cost and interest income, if any,  related to income tax is included in other income.     Current income tax, relating to items recognised  outside of Statement of Profit and Loss, is recognised  outside profit or loss (either in Other Comprehensive  Income or in other equity). Current tax items  are recognised in correlation to the underlying  transaction either in OCI or directly in other equity. The  Management periodically evaluates positions taken  in the tax returns with respect to situations in which  applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation  and established provisions, where appropriate.   Deferred Tax:     Deferred tax is provided using the liability method  on temporary differences between the tax bases of  543 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts for  financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.     Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable  temporary differences, except:     When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial  recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in  a transaction that is not a business combination  and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither  the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and  does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible  temporary differences.     In respect of taxable temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures, when the  timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can  be controlled, and it is probable that the temporary  differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.     Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible  temporary differences, the carry forward of unused  tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax  assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable  that taxable profit will be available, against which  the deductible temporary differences, and the carry  forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses  can be utilised, except:     When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible  temporary differences arises from the initial  recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that  is not a business combination and, at the time of the  transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor  taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal  taxable and deductible temporary differences.     In respect of deductible temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred  tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is  probable that the temporary differences will reverse  in the foreseeable future, and taxable profit will be  available against which the temporary differences can  be utilised.     The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed  at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that  it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit  will be available to allow all or part of the deferred  tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax  assets are re-assessed at each reporting date, and are  recognised to the extent that it has become probable  that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax  asset to be recovered.     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when  the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based  on tax rates (and tax laws), that have been enacted or  substantively enacted at the reporting date.     Deferred tax, relating to items recognised outside  profit or loss, is recognised outside profit or loss (either  in Other Comprehensive Income or in other equity).  Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to  the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly  in other equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred  tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right  exists to set off current tax assets against current tax  liabilities, and the deferred taxes relate to the same  taxable entity and the same taxation authority.     Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination,  but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition  at that date, are recognised subsequently, if new  information about facts and circumstances change.  Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised within  the measurement period reduce goodwill related to  that acquisition, if they result from new information  obtained about facts and circumstances existing  at the acquisition date. If the carrying amount of  goodwill is zero, any remaining deferred tax benefits  are recognised in OCI/capital reserve depending on  the principle explained for bargain purchase gains. All  other acquired tax benefits realised are recognised in  profit or loss. 1.35   Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT):     MAT is recognised as an asset only when and to the  extent there is convincing evidence that the Group  will pay normal Income Tax during the specified period.  In the year in which the MAT credit becomes eligible  to be recognised, it is credited to the Statement of  Profit and Loss, and is considered as MAT Credit  Entitlement. The Group reviews the same at each  Balance Sheet date and writes down the carrying  amount of MAT Credit Entitlement to the extent that  there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect  that the Group will pay normal Income Tax during the  specified period. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credit  are in the form of unused tax credits that are carried  forward by the Group for a specified period of time,  hence, it is presented with Deferred Tax Asset. 544 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 1.36   Provisions and Contingent Liabilities:     Provisions are recognised when the Group has a  present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result  of a past event, it is probable that the Group will  be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.     If the effect of the time value of money is material,  provisions are determined by discounting the  expected future cash flows to the net present value  using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that  reflects current market assessments of the time value  of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to  the liability.     A present obligation that arises from past events,  where it is either not probable that an outflow of  resources will be required to settle or a reliable  estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed  as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also  disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising  from past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events, not wholly  within the control of the Group.     Claims against the Group, where the possibility of any  outflow of resources in settlement is remote, are not  disclosed as contingent liabilities.     Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial  statements since this may result in the recognition  of income that may never be realised. However,  when the realisation of income is virtually certain,  then the related asset is not a contingent asset, and  is recognised.   Warranty Provisions:     Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognised  as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss,  when the product is sold or service provided to the  customer. Initial recognition is based on historical  experience. The initial estimate of warranty-related  costs is revised annually. 1.37   Mines Restoration Provisions:     An obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and  environmental costs arises when environmental  disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing  extraction from mines. Costs, arising from restoration  at closure of the mines and other site preparation  work, are provided for based on their discounted net  present value, with a corresponding amount being  capitalised at the start of each project. The amount  provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation  to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged  to the Statement of Profit and Loss over the life of  the operation through the depreciation of the asset  and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.  The costs are reviewed periodically and are adjusted  to reflect known developments, which may have an  impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the  related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision  due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new  disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The  adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively  over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The  unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 1.38   Segment Reporting:   Identification of Segments:     Operating Segments are identified based on  monitoring of operating results by the chief operating  decision maker (CODM) separately for the purpose  of making decision about resource allocation and  performance assessment. Segment performance is  evaluated based on profit or loss, and is measured  consistently with profit or loss of the Group.     Operating Segment is identified based on the nature of  products and services, the different risks and returns,  and the internal business reporting system.   Segment Policies:     The Group prepares its segment information in  conformity with the accounting policies adopted for  preparing and presenting the financial statements of  the Group as a whole.     Further, inter-segment revenue has been accounted  for based on the transaction price agreed to between  segments, which is primarily market based.     Unallocated Corporate Items include general  corporate income and expenses, which are not  attributable to segments. 1.39   Goodwill on Consolidation:     Goodwill represents the difference between the  Group’s share in the net worth of Subsidiaries and Joint  Ventures and the cost of acquisition at each point of  545 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 time of making the investment in the Subsidiaries and  Joint Ventures. For this purpose, the Group’s share  of net worth is determined on the basis of the latest  financial statements, prior to the acquisition after  making necessary adjustments for material events  between the date of such financial statements and  the date of respective acquisition.     Goodwill that arises out of consolidation is tested  for impairment at each reporting date. For the  purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated  to the respective cash generating unit (‘CGU’). The  impairment loss is recognised if the recoverable  amount of the CGU is higher of its value in use and  fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses are  immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss. 1.40   Earnings Per Share (EPS):     Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing  the net profit for the year attributable to equity  shareholders by the weighted-average number  of equity shares outstanding during the period.  The weighted-average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period and for all periods  presented is adjusted for events such as bonus  issue; bonus element in a rights issue to existing  shareholders; share split; and reverse share split  (consolidation of shares) that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a  corresponding change in resources.     For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per  share, the net profit or loss for the year attributable  to equity shareholders and the weighted-average  number of shares outstanding during the period  are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential  equity shares. 1.41    Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and  Assumptions:     The preparation of financial statements, in conformity,  with the Ind AS requires the judgements, estimates  and assumptions to be made, that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities on the date of the  financial statements, the reported amounts of  revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the disclosures relating to contingent liabilities  as of the date of the financial statements. Although  these estimates are based on the Management’s best  knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty  about these assumptions and estimates could result  in outcomes different from the estimates. Difference  between actual results and estimates are recognised  in the period in which the results are known or  materialise. Estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to the  accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in  the current and future periods.     The key assumptions concerning the future and other  key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting  date, that have a significant risk of causing a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of asset and  liabilities within the next financial year, are described  below. The Company based its assumptions and  estimates on parameters available when the financial  statements were prepared. Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments,  however, may change due to market changes or  circumstances arising that are beyond the control  of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the  assumptions when they occur. (a)   Judgements:     In the process of applying the Group’s accounting  policies, the Management has made the following  judgements, which have the most significant effect  on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated  Financial Statements.     Classification of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited,  Aditya Birla Sun Life Trustee Company Private  Limited, Aditya Birla Wellness Limited and Aditya  Birla Power Composites Limited as Joint Ventures:   1.     Adi tya Birla Capital Limited, a subsidiary of  the Company, holds either directly or through  its subsidiaries, more than half of the equity  shareholding in the following entities. However,  as per the shareholders’ agreement, the Group  needs to jointly decide with other shareholders  of the respective entity on certain relevant  activities. Hence, these entities have been  consolidated as per equity method of accounting:     a)   Adi tya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited     b)     Adi tya Birla Sun Life Trustee Company  Private Limited     c)   Adi tya Birla Wellness Limited 546 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   2.     The C ompany holds more than half of the  equity shareholding in the Aditya Birla Power  Composites Limited. However, as per the  shareholders’ agreement, the Company needs  to jointly decide with other shareholders of the  respective entity on certain relevant activities.  Hence, these entities have been consolidated as  per equity method of accounting:     a)   Adi tya Birla Power Composites Limited         Cla ssification of Madanpur (North) Coal  Company Limited as Investment in an  Associate:         A Joi nt Venture Company (JV), “Madanpur  (North) Coal Company Limited”, was formed  by allocatees of Madanpur North Coal Block.  As per Ind AS 111, when all the parties or a  group of parties considered collectively are  able to direct the activities that significantly  affect the returns of the arrangement (i.e.,  the relevant activities), the parties control  the arrangement collectively. Also, joint  control exists only when decisions about the  relevant activities require the unanimous  consent of all the parties. In terms of the  JV agreement between the parties, each  JV partner has the right to nominate one  director on the Board of the Joint Venture  Company, and major decisions shall be  taken by a majority of 75% of the directors’  present. Since there is no unanimous  consent required from the parties, in  the judgement of the Management the  Company, does not have joint control over  the JV. However, considering the Company’s  representation in the Board and the extent  of its ability to exercise the influence over  the decision over the relevant activities, the  JV has been considered as an associate and  accounted under the equity method.     (b)   Est imates and Assumptions:         The k ey assumptions concerning the  future and other key sources of estimation  uncertainty at the reporting date, that  have a significant risk of causing a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of asset  and liabilities within the next financial year,  are described below. The Group based its  assumptions and estimates on parameters  available when the financial statements  were prepared. Existing circumstances and  assumptions about future developments,  however, may change due to market  changes or circumstances arising that  are beyond the control of the Group. Such  changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur.   i.   Cla ssification of Lease Ind AS 116:       Ind AS 1 16 Leases requires a lessee to determine  the lease term as the non-cancellable period of  a lease adjusted with any option to extend or  terminate the lease, if the use of such option  is reasonably certain. The Company makes an  assessment on the expected lease term on lease- by-lease basis, and thereby assesses whether it  is reasonably certain that any options to extend  or terminate the contract will be exercised.  In evaluating the lease term, the Company  considers factors such as any significant  leasehold improvements undertaken over the  lease term, costs relating to the termination  of lease and the importance of the underlying  lease to the Company’s operations taking into  account the location of the underlying asset and  the availability of the suitable alternatives. The  lease term in future periods is re-assessed to  ensure that the lease term reflects the current  economic circumstances. The discount rate is  generally based on the incremental borrowing  rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a  portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.   ii.     Use ful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment  and Intangible Assets:        The G roup uses its technical expertise along with  historical and industry trends for determining the  economic life of an asset/component of an asset.  The useful lives are reviewed by the Management  periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of  a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount  is charged over the remaining useful life of  the assets.   iii.   Mine s Restoration Obligation:       In det ermining the fair value of the Mines  Restoration Obligation, assumptions and  estimates are made in relation to discount rates,  the expected cost of mines restoration and the  expected timing of those costs. 547 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   iv.   Mea surement of Defined Benefit Obligation:       The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan  and the present value of the gratuity obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations. An  actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include  the determination of the discount rate, future  salary increases and mortality rates. Due to  the complexities involved in the valuation  and its long-term nature, a defined benefit  obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at  each reporting date.   v.   Def erred Tax Assets/Deferred Tax Liability:       Pur suant to the announcement of the changes  in the corporate tax regime, the companies have  an option to either opt for the new tax regime or  continue to pay taxes as per the old applicable  tax structure together with the other benefits  available to the companies including utilisation  of the MAT credit available. This requires  significant estimation in determining in which  year the company would migrate to the new  tax regime basis future year’s taxable profits  including the impact of ongoing expansion plans  of the Company and consequential utilisation of  available MAT credit. Accordingly, in accordance  with IND AS 12 - Income Taxes, deferred tax  assets and liabilities are required to be measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the  year when the asset is realised or the liability is  settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted at  the reporting date.   vi.     Rec ognition and Measurement of Provisions  and Contingencies:       Key  assumptions about the likelihood and  magnitude of an outflow of resources.       The company reviews and recognises provisions  on periodic basis. Provisions are recognised,  when the company has a present obligation as  a result of a past event and it is probable that  an outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation  and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of the obligation.   vii.     Fair Value Measurement of Financial  Instruments:        Whe n the fair value of financial assets and  financial liabilities recorded in the Balance Sheet  cannot be measured based on quoted prices in  active markets, their fair values are measured  using valuation techniques including the  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The inputs to  these models are taken from observable market  where possible, but where this is not feasible, a  degree of judgement is required in establishing  fair values. Judgements include consideration  of input such as liquidity risk, credit risk and  volatility. Changes in assumptions about these  factors could affect the reported fair value of  financial instruments.   viii.   Sha re-Based Payments:       The Group measures the cost of equity-settled  transactions with employees using Black-Scholes  Model and Binomial Model to determine the fair  value of the liability incurred on the grant date.  Estimating fair value for share-based payment  transactions requires determination of the most  appropriate valuation model, which is dependent  on the terms and conditions of the grant.       Thi s estimate also requires determination of  the most appropriate inputs to the valuation  model including the expected life of the share  option, volatility and dividend yield and making  assumptions about them.       The assumptions and models used for estimating  fair value for share-based payment transactions  are disclosed in Note 4.5.   ix.   Disp osal Groups:       The C ompany has used comparable market  multiple approach to assess the fair value of the  disposal group of assets/liabilities.       Und er the market multiple approach value of  the equity shares of a company is arrived at  by using multiples derived from valuations of  comparable companies, as manifested through  stock market valuations of listed companies for  which the Company has considered Enterprise  Value/Revenue and Enterprise value/EBITDA  multiples based on their market price and latest  published financials. 548 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   x.   Litigation and Contingencies:       The Company has ongoing litigations with various  regulatory authorities. Where an outflow of funds  is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate  of the outcome of the dispute can be made based  on the Management’s assessment of specific  circumstances of each dispute and relevant  external advice, the Management provides for its  best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by  nature complex and can take number of years to  resolve, and can involve estimation uncertainty.  Information about such litigations is provided in  notes to the financial statements.   xi.     Ass essment of Impairment of Investments in  Equity Accounted Investees:       The C ompany reviews its carrying value of  investments in Equity Accounted Investees  annually, or more frequently when there is  indication for impairment. If the recoverable  amount is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is accounted for. Determining  whether the investments in equity accounted  investees is impaired requires an estimate in the  value in use of investments. The Management  carries out impairment assessment for each  investment by comparing the carrying value  of each investment with the net worth of  each company based on audited financials,  comparable market price and comparing the  performance of the investee companies with  projections used for valuations, in particular  those relating to the cash flows, sales growth  rate, pre-tax discount rate and growth rates used  and approved business plans.   xii.     Impairment of Non-Current Assets (Non- Financial):       At th e end of each reporting period, the Group  reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and  intangible assets to determine whether there is  any indication that those assets have suffered  an impairment loss. If any such indication exists,  the recoverable amount, which is the higher of  the value in use or fair value less cost to sell, of  the asset or cash-generating unit, as the case  may be, is estimated, and impairment loss (if  any) is recognised and the carrying amount is  reduced to its recoverable amount. In assessing  the value in use, the estimated future cash flows  are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the  risk specific to the assets for which the estimates  of future cash flows have not been adjusted. When  it is not possible to estimate the recoverable  amount of an individual asset, the Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit to which the asset belongs.       Whe n an impairment loss subsequently  reverses, the carrying amount of the asset  or a cash generating unit is increased to the  revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so  that the increased carrying amount does not  exceed the carrying amount that would have  been determined has no impairment loss been  recognised for the asset (or cash-generating  unit) earlier.       Inta ngible assets with indefinite useful lives  and intangible assets not yet available for use  are tested for impairment at least annually, and  whenever there is an indication that the asset  may be impaired.   xiii.   Impairment of Financial Assets:       The measurement of impairment losses across all  categories of financial assets requires judgement,  in particular, the estimation of the amount and  timing of future cash flows and collateral values  when determining impairment losses and the  assessment of a significant increase in credit  risk. These estimates are driven by a number of  factors, changes in which can result in different  levels of allowances.       The Company’s ECL calculations are outputs of  complex models with a number of underlying  assumptions regarding the choice of variable  inputs and their inter-dependencies. Elements of  the ECL models that are considered accounting  judgements and estimates include:     a.     The C ompany’s internal credit grading model,  which assigns PDs to the individual grades     b.     The  Company’s criteria for assessing if there  has been a significant increase in credit  risk, and so allowances for financial assets  should be measured on a LTECL basis and  the qualitative assessment     c.

Selec tion of forward-looking macro- economic scenarios and their probability  weightings, to derive the economic inputs  into the ECL models       It has been the Company’s policy to regularly  review its models in the context of actual loss  experience and adjust, when necessary.   xiv.   Bus iness Combination:       For  the purpose of accounting of business  combination, following key judgements are made: •       (a)   Fai r Valuation of Intangible Assets:         The C ompany has used income approach  (example relief from royalty, multi-period  excess earnings method and incremental  cash flows, etc.), for value analysis of  intangible assets. The method estimates  the value of future cash flows over the life  of the Intangible assets accruing to the  Company, by virtue of the transaction. The  resulting post-tax cash flows for each of the  years are recognised at their present value  using a Weighted-Average Cost of Capital  (‘WACC’) adjusted for risk of achieving the  intangible assets projected savings.     (b)   Fai r Valuation of Tangible Assets:         Fre ehold land: Freehold land is fair valued  using the sales comparison method  using prevailing rates of similar plots of  land, circle rates provided by relevant  regulatory authorities and other acceptable  valuation techniques.         Lea sehold Land: Leasehold land is valued  basis the leasehold interest for the  remaining duration of the lease.         Oth er Assets: The cost approach has been  adopted for fair valuing all the assets.  The cost approach includes calculation  of replacement cost using price trends  applied to historical cost and capitalisation  of all the indirect cost, these trends are on  the basis of price indices obtained from  recognised sources.     (c)   Fai r Valuation of Loans:         The  fair value of loans given/borrowed has  been estimated by considering the cash  flows, future credit losses and the rate  of prepayments for each loan. Projected  annual cash flows were then discounted to  the present value based on a market rate for  similar loans.         The a llowance for loan losses, associated  with the acquired loans, were evaluated by  the Management and recorded.     (d)    Fai r Valuation of Current Assets  and Liabilities:         The C urrent Assets and Liabilities are taken  at fair value on the date of acquisition. 1.42   Cash Dividend to Equity Holders of the Group:     The Group recognises a liability to make cash  distributions to equity holders of the Group when  the distribution is authorised and the distribution  is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As  per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is  authorised when it is approved by the shareholders.  A corresponding amount is recognised directly in  other equity. 1.43   Recent Accounting Pronouncements:     New and amended standards adopted by the  Company:     Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies  new standards or amendments to the existing  standards under Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For  the year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified  Ind AS-117 Insurance Contracts.

Potential impairment is identified by comparing the recoverable value of a cash-generating units to its carrying value.  The Company estimates the recoverable value based on fair value less cost to sell approach following income approach  and market approach. The determination of recoverable value using the income and market approaches requires the  use of estimates and assumptions related to selection of multiples and control premium for the market approach and  sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, capital spending and discount rate for the income approach. Under income  approach, the recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculation, which requires the use of certain  assumptions. The calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Management  covering three to five years period, depending upon segments/CGUs financial budgeting process. Cash flow beyond these  financial budget periods is extrapolated using the estimated growth rates. Under market approach, recoverable amount  is determined based on average of comparable companies multiple suitable for the industry to which business relates. During the current year, the Company has carried out the Impairment Testing of Goodwill allocated to its  business segments. A.   Building Materials The goodwill allocated to Building Materials Segment is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances  indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated  are tested for impairment annually.  Potential impairment is identified by comparing the recoverable value of a CGU to its carrying value. The recoverable  amount has been determined based on value in use. Value in use has been determined based on future cash flows, after  considering current economic conditions, industry trends, estimated future operating results, growth rates and anticipated  future economic conditions. As at 31 st  March 2025, the estimated cash flows for a period of 5 years were developed using  internal forecasts, and a weighted average cost of capital of ~12% (31 st  March 2024: ~ 12%). The cash flows beyond 5 years  have been extrapolated assuming nil long-term growth rates. While determining the cashflows factors such as cement  sales volume growth, price per bag, input cost expectation etc. are considered. As per the current business operation, it  expects stable state on the factors and same is supported by the cement industry outlook 558 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Based on the impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the CGU’s exceeds its carrying amount including goodwill.  Therefore, no impairment loss was recognised during the year ended 31 st  March 2025. Sensitivity analysis with 1% change in  growth rate and weighted average cost of capital also indicates that no impairment required on carrying amount of goodwill. B.   Financial Services     The key assumption used in the estimation of the recoverable amount of various CGUs is set out below. The values  assigned to the key assumptions represent the Management ‘s assessment of future trends in the relevant sector,  and have been based on historical and external data from both external and internal sources. Financial Services Business Key Assumptions As at 31 st  March 2025 As at 31 st  March 2024 Aditya Birla Housing Finance  Limited (ABHFL) and Aditya  Birla Finance Limited (ABFL) (i) Market Price to Adjusted  Book Value 2.0 - 3.1 times   (Based on average of comparable  companies multiple) 1.8 - 2.9 times   (Based on average of comparable  companies multiple) Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance  Limited (ABSLI) (ii) Market Capitalisation (-)  Embedded Value /VNB 11.3 times   (Based on average of comparable  companies multiple) 9 times   (Based on average of comparable  companies multiple) (i)     For ABHFL and ABFL, based on our result of value analysis on the basis of price to adjusted book value multiple of  comparable companies, the fair value of the CGUs, to whom goodwill was allocated, is higher than the respective  carrying amount.     As a result of impairment test for the year ended 31 st  March 2025, no goodwill impairment was identified as the  fair value of the CGUs, to whom goodwill was allocated, exceeded their respective carrying amount. (Previous  Year  H  Nil). (ii)     ABSLI, based on our result of value analysis on the basis of key assumptions as stated above, the fair value of  CGU exceeds the carrying amount of assets of the CGU. As a result of impairment test for the year ended 31 st   March 2025, no goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of the CGUs, to whom goodwill was allocated,  exceeded their respective carrying amount. (iii)     ABML, the recoverable amount is determined based on fair value less cost to sell i.e. asset market price less cost  of disposal.      As a result of impairment test for the year ended 31 st  March 2025, no goodwill impairment was identified as  the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which goodwill was allocated was higher than their carrying amount  (Previous Year  H  Nil). 559 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements

The National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata and Mumbai Benches (“NCLT”) have approved the Composite Scheme  of Arrangement between Kesoram Industries Limited (“Kesoram”/ “KIL”), UTCL and their respective shareholders  and creditors, in compliance with sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013  (“Scheme”) by its Order dated 14 th  November, 2024 and 26 th  November 2024 respectively. The Scheme is made  effective from 1 st  March 2025, and the Appointed date of the Scheme is 1 st  April 2024.      Upon the Scheme becoming effective and with effect from the Appointed Date, the Cement Business Division of  Kesoram (“the Demerged Undertaking”) as defined in the Scheme stands transferred to and vested in UTCL as a  going concern.     Consequently, UTCL has included the financial statements/ information of the Demerged Undertaking in its standalone  financial statements with effect from 1 st  April 2024 (which is deemed to be the acquisition date for purpose of Ind AS  103 – Business Combinations) to include the financial results/ information of the acquired Cement Business Division  of KIL (“the Demerged Undertaking”).

(b)   Acquisition of The India Cements Limited (ICEM) - Ind AS 103 i.     On  24 th  December 2024, UTCL completed the acquisition of control over India Cements Limited (ICEM) through  a step acquisition. Initially, on 27 th  June 2024, UTCL acquired a non-controlling stake of 7,05,64,656 equity shares  representing 22.77% of the equity share capital of ICEM for a cash consideration of  H   1,942.86 crore. Subsequently  on 24 th  December 2024 UTCL acquired an additional 10,13,91,231 equity shares representing 32.72% of the equity  share capital of ICEM for a cash consideration of  H   3,954.26 crore; thereby UTCL’s total shareholding increased to  17,19,55,887 equity shares representing 55.49% of ICEM’s equity share capital, resulting in ICEM becoming a subsidiary  of UTCL with effect from 24 th  December 2024. UTCL also has become the promoter of ICEM in accordance with the  SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 612 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     As required under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers)  Regulations, 2011 (“SEBI Takeover Regulations”), following the acquisition of control, UTCL was obligated to make a  public open offer to the remaining shareholders of ICEM. The open offer was successfully completed on 21 st  January  2025, with a final acquisition of 8,05,73,273 equity shares representing 26% of the shares of ICEM under the open offer  at price of  H   390/- per share.     Total shareholding of UTCL in ICEM post-acquisition of shares from public shareholders through open offer  accumulates to 25,25,29,160 equity shares representing 81.49%. Total purchase consideration as per Ind AS 103 is  H   9,725.51 crore.     For the non-controlling stake of 22.77% acquired on 27 th  June 2024, UTCL did not execute significant influence  or control over decision of ICEM so it was not being construed as an Associate company. Thus, UTCL measured  this equity investment as per Indian Accounting Standard 109 – Financial Instruments (Ind AS 109) and at initial  recognition, made an irrevocable election to present in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) subsequent changes in  its fair value.     As per Para 42 of Ind AS 103, since the Business combination was achieved in stages when UTCL acquired additional  32.72% controlling stake in ICEM on 24 th  December 2024; UTCL had remeasured its previously held equity interest  of 22.77% in ICEM at its acquisition date fair value and recognised the resulting gain in OCI. Total accumulated fair  value gain net of tax in OCI of  H   587.92 crore is transferred to retained earnings from OCI.     India Cements has a total capacity of 14.45  MTPA  of grey cement. Of this, 12.95  MTPA  is in the South and 1.5  MTPA   is in Rajasthan. The acquisition of controlling stake in ICEM provides UTCL an opportunity to extend its footprint and  presence in the highly fragmented, competitive and fast-growing Southern market in the country.     This will also create value for shareholders on account of operational efficiencies arising out of ready to use assets  reducing time to markets, availability of land and mining leases leading to overall operating costs advantage.     Pursuant to completion of the Open Offer, the shareholding of the public shareholders in ICEM has fallen below the  minimum public shareholding requirement as per Rule 19A of the SCRR read with SEBI (LODR) Regulations. UTCL  will ensure that ICEM satisfies the minimum public shareholding set out in Rule 19A of the SCRR in compliance with  applicable laws, within a period of 12 (twelve) months from the completion of the Open Offer.     The Consolidated financial statements include the financial results for ICEM w.e.f. 24 th  December 2024 and hence  the figures for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 are not comparable with the previous corresponding period.     Pursuant to obtaining control, UTCL has accounted on provisional basis the fair value of the assets acquired and  liabilities as at the acquisition date as per the requirements of Ind AS 103. ii.

Together with the existing shareholding of 29.79% in  RAKWCT, UCMEIL’s aggregate shareholding in RAKWCT stands increased to 54.79%. Consequently, RAKWCT became  a subsidiary of UCMEIL with effect from 10 th  July 2024.

The gratuity plan provides a lump sum  payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of service, whichever is earlier, of  an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary for each completed year of service as per rules framed in this regard.  Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service in accordance with Indian law. In case of majority  of employees, the Group’s scheme is more favourable as compared to the obligation under the payment of Gratuity  Act, 1972.     The present value of obligation is determined based on actuarial valuation using the Projected Unit Credit Method as  prescribed by the Ind AS-19 ‘Employee Benefits’, which recognises each period of service as giving rise to additional  unit of employee benefit entitlement and measure each unit separately to build up final obligation. 650 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   Inherent Risk:     The plan is defined benefit in nature, which is sponsored by the Group, and, hence, it underwrites all the risks  pertaining to the plan. In particular, this exposes the Group to actuarial risk such as adverse salary growth, changes  in demographic experience, inadequate return on underlying plan assets. This may result in an increase in cost of  providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the benefits are lump sum in nature, the plan is not subject to  any longevity risk. b)   Pension:   The Group provides pension to few retired employees as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.   Inherent Risk:     The plan is of a defined benefit in nature, which is sponsored by the Group, and, hence, it underwrites all the risks  pertaining to the plan. In particular, there is a risk for the Group that any adverse increase in salary increases for  serving employees/pension increase for pensioners or adverse demographic experience can result in an increase  in the cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. In this case, the pension is paid directly by the Group  (instead of pension being bought out from an insurance company) during the lifetime of the pensioners/beneficiaries  and, hence, the plan carries the longevity risks. c)   Post-Retirement Medical Benefits:     The Group provides post-retirement medical benefits to certain ex-employees, who were transferred under the Scheme  of Arrangement for acquiring Larsen & Toubro cement business, and eligible for such benefits from earlier Company. 4.8.1.1 Gratuity and Pension:  ( H   in crore) Gratuity  Pension and Post- Retirement Medical Benefits Funded Others Funded Others Pension Post-  Retirement  Medical  Benefits Pension Post-  Retirement  Medical  Benefits As at 31 st  March 2025 As at 31 st  March 2024 As at 31 st  March 2025 As at 31 st  March 2024 (i) Reconciliation of Present Value  of the Obligation:  Opening Defined Benefit  Obligation 1,769.41 34.39 1,585.84 29.60 33.50 0.50 33.74 0.51 Adjustments of: Transferred on Acquisition of  Subsidiary / Composite Scheme  of Arrangement (Note 4.3) 111.22 24.79 - - 33.30 - - - Current Service Cost 148.73 4.98 130.68 2.98 - - - - Past Service Cost - - 0.03 - - - - - Interest Cost 125.39 2.57 112.06 1.49 4.00 0.03 2.44 0.04 Actuarial Loss/(Gain) 26.89 2.83 71.73 1.40 (0.88) - 3.29 (0.01) Liabilities Assumed on  Acquisition/(Settled on  Divestiture) (0.40) - 1.88 - - - - - De-recognised on account of  divestment of Subsidiary    (Note 4.12.4) (5.95) - - - - - - - Opening Liabilities transferred  from Unfunded to Funded 0.91 (0.91) - - - - - - Foreign Currency Fluctuation - (2.70) - 0.50 - - - - Benefits Paid (158.04) (7.44) (132.81) (1.58) (13.55) (0.04) (5.97) (0.04) Closing Defined Benefit  Obligation 2,018.16 58.50 1,769.41 34.39 56.37 0.49 33.50 0.50 651 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements

(xi)   Basis Used to determine Discount Rate:     Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the Balance Sheet date,  applicable to the period over which the obligation is expected to be settled. (xii)   Asset - Liability Matching Strategy:     The money contributed by the Company to the fund to finance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested.      The trustees of the plan are required to invest the funds as per the prescribed pattern of investments laid out in the  Income Tax rules for such approved schemes. Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by  the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset-liability matching strategy to manage risk actively.      There is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully pre - fund the liability of the Plan. The Company’s philosophy  is to fund the benefits based on its own liquidity and tax position, as well as level of underfunding of the Plan. (xiii)  Salary Escalation Rate:     The estimates of future salary increase are considered taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion, increments  and other relevant factors. (xiv)  Sensitivity Analysis:     Sensitivity Analysis has been calculated to show the movement in defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming  there are no other changes in the market condition at the accounting date. There have been no changes from the  previous periods in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis. (xv)    The best estimate of the expected contribution for the next year amounts to  H   101.89 crore    (Previous Year  H   25.14 crore). 654 Grasim Industries Limited

Disclosure of Financial Instruments:   a.   Equ ity Instruments (Other than Joint Ventures and Associates)       These investments have to be fair valued either through OCI or Profit and Loss. Investments in the Company  have been designated on initial recognition to be measured at FVTOCI as these are strategic investments and  are not intended for sale. However, few of the equity instruments held by the Subsidiary Companies have been  designated to be measured at FVTPL as these investments are held for trading.   b.   Deben tures and Bonds       Inve stments in Debentures or Bonds meet the contractual cash flow test as required by Ind AS 109: Financial  Instruments. However, the business model of the Company and generally is such that it does not hold these  investments till maturity (except Financial Service business) as the Company intends to sell these investments  as and when need arises.   c.   Mut ual Funds and Preference Shares Designated at FVTPL       Pre ference Shares and Mutual Funds have been measured at FVTPL as these financial assets do not pass the  contractual cash flow test as required by Ind AS 109: “Financial Instruments”, for being measured at amortised  cost or FVTOCI, hence, classified at FVTPL.

Fair Value Measurements (Ind AS 113)     The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be  exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.     The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments based  on the input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:]     Level 1:     Thi s hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair  value of all Equity Shares, which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price at the  reporting date.     Level 2:      Cat egory includes financial assets and liabilities measured using a valuation technique based on assumptions  that are supported by prices from observable current market transactions. These include assets and  liabilities for which pricing is obtained via pricing services, but where prices have not been determined in  an active market, financial assets with fair values based on broker quotes and assets that are valued using  the Group’s own valuation models whereby the material assumptions are market observable. The majority  of the Group’s over-the-counter derivatives and several other instruments not traded in active markets fall  within this category.     Level 3:      Cat egory includes financial assets and liabilities measured using valuation techniques based on non- market observable inputs. Valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.  However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, to estimate an exit price from the  perspective of the Group. The main asset classes in this category are unlisted equity investments as well  as unlisted funds. 657 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements

The fair value of loans, security deposits and investments in preference shares was calculated based on cash flows  discounted using a current lending rate. They are classified as Level 3 fair value hierarchy due to inclusion of unobservable  inputs including counter party credit risk. During the year ended 31 st  March 2025 and 31 st  March 2024, there was no transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 fair  value measurement. 4.9.1 Key Inputs for Level 1 and Level 2 Fair Valuation Technique: 1.

(ii)     the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as per the present value determined using  forward exchange rates and interest rate curve of the respective currencies.   (iii)     the fair value of foreign currency swap is calculated as per the present value determined using forward exchange  rates, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and an appropriate  discount factor.   (iv)   the fair value of foreign currency option contracts is determined using the Black-Scholes Valuation Model.

Aligned with the business planning process, the ERM framework covers all business  risks including strategic risk, operational risks, investment risks and insurance risks. The key business risks identified  are approved by the Board’s Risk Management Committee and monitored by the Risk Management team thereafter.  Insurance Business also has in place an Operational Risk Management (ORM) framework that supports excellence  in business processes, system and facilitates matured business decisions to move to a proactive risk assessment,  and is in the process of implementing the key operational risk components. 661 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025     Insurance business recognises that information is a critical business asset, and that our ability to operate effectively  and succeed in a competitive market depends on our ability to ensure that business information is protected adequately  through appropriate controls and proactive measures. Accordingly, Insurance business has an information security  framework that ensures all the information assets are safeguarded by establishing comprehensive management  processes throughout the organisation.     Insurance Business Investments Function is governed by the Investment Committee and the Asset Liability  Management Committee, appointed by the Board of Directors. Investment Policy and Operating Guidelines laid  down by the Board provide the framework for management and mitigation of the risks associated with investments.  Asset Liability Policy and various Asset Liability Management (ALM) strategies are adopted to ensure adequate Asset  Liability Management. These policies are reviewed at frequent intervals by the respective Board Committees and  approved by the Board.     Insurance Business has a robust Business Continuity Framework to ensure resumption of time sensitive activities  within the defined time frame at defined levels. Insurance Business is certified against ISO 22301 (Globally accepted  standard on Business Continuity).     Insurance Business through its risk management policies has set up systems to continuously monitor its experience  with regard to other parameters that affect the value of benefits offered in the products. Such parameters include  policy lapses, premium persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns.    ERM encompasses the following areas:   Governed by risk policies and operating guidelines approved by the Board Committee/Sub Committee of the Board   1.   Risk  identification   2.   Ris k response and risk management strategy   3.   Risk  monitoring, communication and reporting a.   Risk Policies     The following risk policies govern and implement effective risk management practices:   Product Design and Pricing Policy, Underwriting and Liability Management Policy, Re-insurance Ceded Policy,  Capital Management Policy, Investment Policies, Dealing Room Policy, Broker Empanelment Policy, Valuation Policy,  Information Security Policies, Internet and E-mail Usage Policy, Logical Access Security Policy, External Access  Security Policy, Physical Access Security Policy, Business Continuity Policy, Operational Risk Management Policy,  Fraud Reporting and Investigating Policy, Asset-Liability Management Policy, Outsourcing Policy and Anti-Money  Laundering Policy. b.   Capital Management Objectives and Policies     Insurance Business has established the following capital management objectives, policies and approach to managing  the risks that affect its capital position:   i)     To maintain the required level of stability of the Company, thereby providing a degree of security to policyholders   ii)     To allocate capital efficiently and support the development of business by ensuring that returns on capital  employed meet the requirements of its capital providers and shareholders   iii)   To retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets     iv)   To align the profile of assets and liabilities taking account of risks inherent in the business 662 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   v)     To maintain financial strength to support new business growth and to satisfy the requirements of the  policyholders, regulators and stakeholders   vi)     To maintain strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios, in order to support its business objectives and  maximise shareholders value       Insu rance Business has met all of these requirements throughout the financial year. In reporting, financial  strength, capital and solvency are measured using the rules prescribed by the Insurance Regulatory Authority  of India (IRDAI). These regulatory capital tests are based upon required levels of solvency, capital and a series  of prudent assumptions in respect of the type of business written. The company’s Capital Management Policy  for its Insurance and Non–Insurance Business is to hold sufficient capital to cover the statutory requirements  based on the IRDAI directives. c.   Regulatory Framework     Regulators are primarily interested in protecting the rights of policyholders and monitor them closely to ensure  that the Insurance Business is satisfactorily managing affairs for their benefits. At the same time, regulators are  also interested in ensuring that the Company maintains an appropriate solvency position to meet unforeseeable  liabilities arising from economic shocks or natural disasters. The operations of the Company are subject to regulatory  requirements within the jurisdictions in which it operates.   Insurance and Financial Risk     The principal risk the group faces under insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments or the  timing thereof, differ from expectations. This is influenced by the frequency of claims, severity of claims, actual  benefits paid and subsequent development of long–term claims. Therefore, the objective of the group is to ensure  that sufficient reserves are available to cover these liabilities.     The risk exposure is mitigated by diversification across a large portfolio of insurance contracts and geographical  areas. The variability of risks is also improved by careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategy  guidelines, as well as the use of reinsurance arrangements. 1.   Life insurance contracts and investment contracts with and without Discretionary Participation Feature (DPF)     Ind AS 104 requires products offered by the Insurance Company to classify them in Insurance Contract and Investment  Contract. Each contract needs to be classified in insurance contract and investment contract based on the risk  they carry.     A contract would be an insurance contract and investment contracts with DPF if the benefit payable on death is  higher by:   at least 5% of the fund value at any time during the life on the contract for unit linked products, or     at 5% of the premium at any time during the life of the contract for other than unit linked products   All other contracts are categorised as Investment Contracts.     For contracts with DPF, the participating nature of these contracts results in a significant portion of the insurance  risk being shared with the insured party. For contracts without DPF, group charges for death and disability risks on  a quarterly basis. Under these contracts group has the right to alter these charges to take account of death and  disability experience, thereby mitigating the risks to the group. 663 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025   The main risks that the Group is exposed to are as follows:   i)     Persistency Risk –  risk of loss arising due to policyholder experiences (lapses and surrenders) being different  than expected   ii)   Mortality Risk –  risk of loss arising due to policyholder death experience being different than expected   iii)   Morbidity Risk –  risk of loss arising due to policyholder health experience being different than expected   iv)   Longevity Risk –  risk of loss arising due to the annuitant living longer than expected   v)   Investment Return Risk –  risk of loss arising from actual returns being different than expected   vi)   Expense Risk –  risk of loss arising from expense experience being different than expected   vii)     Product and Pricing Risk –  risk of loss due to incorrect pricing or not adhering to the product regulations or  higher payouts due to ambiguity in terms and conditions   viii)    Reinsurance Risk –  The Company enters into reinsurance agreements in order to mitigate insurance risk.  However, this leads to default risk from the reinsurer at the time of claim payment or also concentration risk if  all the risk is insured to one reinsurer.   ix)    Concentration Risk –  The Company faces concentration risk by selling business to specific geography or by  writing only single line business, etc. Control Measures The actuarial department has set up systems to continuously monitor the Company’s experience with regard to parameters  like policy lapses, premium persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns. The underwriting team, with  actuarial guidance, has set in place processes and procedures to review proposal. Many products offered by the Company  also have an investment guarantee. The Company has set aside additional reserves to cover this risk.  Further, the possible financial effect of adverse mortality and morbidity experience has been reduced by entering into  reinsurance agreements with multiple reinsurers. The Company has entered into a separate agreement with reinsurers  to cover the catastrophic risks under individual and group business. A further element of managing risk is to limit the exposure to individual segments of the population. In essence, being  over-represented in any population segment will increase the variance of the Company’s experience, and so there are  advantages to diversifying across all relevant population segments, at least until data is available to confirm which  segments can be expected to have relatively favorable experience. At the present stage in the Company’s development,  the focus is on building new distribution and so geographical diversification is actively taking place. In future, the actuarial  team will need to be alert to assess potential risk aggregations. The Company has a Board approved risk management policy covering underwriting, claims and reserving for policy  liabilities. The Company has a detailed claims processing manual in place. Complicated and large claims are referred to  the Company’s Claims Review Committee. 664 Grasim Industries Limited

Material judgement is required in  determining the liabilities and in the choice of assumptions. Best estimate assumptions in use are based on historical  and current experience, internal data, some judgement and as per guidance notes/actuarial practice standards. However  for the purpose of valuation an additional level of prudence has been kept on all the best estimate assumptions known as  MfAD (margin for adverse deviation). The Company keeps adequate MfAD, as prescribed in APS 7, issued by the Institute  of Actuaries of India (IAI), in all assumptions over the best estimate value. Best Estimate Assumptions are further evaluated on a continuous basis in order to ensure realistic and reasonable valuations. Assumptions can vary by type of product, duration, gender etc if the experience of any category is significantly different  and data is credible for the respective category. The key assumptions to which the estimation of liabilities is particularly sensitive are, as follows: i)   Mortality and Morbidity Rates     Assumptions are based on historical experience and for new products based on industry/reinsurers data. An  appropriate, but not excessive, allowance may be made for expected future improvements. Assumptions may vary  by type of product, distribution channel, gender, etc.     An increase in mortality/morbidity rates will usually lead to a larger number/amount of claims (and claims could occur  sooner than anticipated), which will increase the liability and reduce profits for the shareholders. ii)   Longevity     Assumptions are based on standard industry and national tables, adjusted when appropriate to reflect the group’s  own risk experience. An appropriate, but not excessive, prudent allowance is made for expected future improvements.  Assumptions are normally differentiated by gender, underwriting class and contract type. An increase in longevity  rates will lead to an increase in the number of annuity payments to be made, which will increase the liability and reduce  profits for the shareholders.   666 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 iii)   Investment Return and Discount Rate     The weighted average rate of return is derived based on a model portfolio, that is assumed to back liabilities,  consistent with the long–term asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on current market returns as  well as expectations about future economic and financial developments.     An increase in investment return would lead to an increase in profits for the shareholders.     Life insurance liabilities are determined as the sum of the discounted value of the expected benefits and future  administration expenses directly related to the contract, less the discounted value of the expected theoretical  premiums that would be required to meet these future cash outflows. Discount rates are based on investment  strategy of the group, current industry risk rates, adjusted for the group’s own risk exposure.     A decrease in the discount rate will increase the value of the insurance liability and therefore reduce profits for  the shareholders. iv)   Expenses and Inflation     Operating expenses assumptions reflect the projected costs of maintaining and servicing in–force policies and  associated overhead expenses. The current level of expenses is taken as an appropriate expense base, adjusted for  expected expense inflation, if appropriate.     An increase in the level of expenses would result in an increase in expenditure, thereby reducing profits for  the shareholders. v)   Lapse, Surrender and Partial Withdrawal Rates     Lapses relate to the termination of policies due to non–payment of premiums. Surrenders relate to the voluntary  termination of policies by policyholders. Policy termination assumptions are determined using statistical measures  based on the group’s experience, and usually vary by product type, policy duration and sales trends.     An increase in lapse rates, early in the life of the policy would tend to reduce profits for shareholders, but later  increases are broadly neutral in effect.     The best estimate assumptions that have the greatest effect on the Statement of Financial Position and the Statement  of Profit and Loss of the Company are listed below.

Sensitivity Analysis The following analysis is performed for reasonably possible movements in key assumptions with all other assumptions  held constant, showing the impact on gross liabilities. The correlation of assumptions will have a significant effect in  determining the ultimate liabilities, but to demonstrate the impact due to changes in assumptions, assumptions had to  be changed on an individual basis. It should be noted that movements in these assumptions are non–linear. The method  used for deriving sensitivity information and significant assumptions made did not change from the previous period. The  sensitivities are same as shared with Regulators during annual reporting.

Group is subject to credit risk in connection with issuers of securities held in our investment portfolio,  reinsurers. Losses may occur when a counterparty fails to make timely payments pursuant to the terms of the underlying  contractual arrangement or when the counterparty’s credit rating or risk profile otherwise deteriorates. Credit risk can  occur at multiple levels, as a result of broad economic conditions, challenges within specific sectors of the economy, or  from issues affecting individual companies. Events that result in defaults, impairments or downgrades of the securities  in our investment portfolio would cause the Group to record realised or unrealised losses and increase our provisions for  asset default, adversely impacting earnings. 668 Grasim Industries Limited

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 It is the Group’s policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across its credit portfolio. This enables the  Management to focus on the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic  regions and products. The rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics combined with processed market  information to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk. All internal risk ratings are tailored  to the various categories, and are derived in accordance with the Group’s rating policy. The attributable risk ratings are  assessed and updated regularly. The Group manages its product mix to ensure that there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Expected Credit Loss In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition  of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: a)     Financial assets that are measured at amortised cost; and b)   Financial assets (debt) that are measured as at Fairvalue.     ECL has been calculated on Non-ULIP portfolio as ULIP portfolio is marked-to-market. For recognition of impairment  loss on financial assets and risk exposure, the group determines that whether there has been a significant increase in  the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide  for impairment loss.     Loss Given Default (LGD) of 75% has been assumed across all securities.     ECL allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as an expense/income in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.     The Group does not have any purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, i.e., financial assets  which are credit impaired on purchase/origination.     On other items, as per simplified approach, the Group makes provision on agent receivable, security deposit and other  creditors as per our policy basis the ageing of corresponding assets and liability. ECL Allowance computed, basis above, during the period under consideration is as follows: H   in crore Movement of Allowances  Year Ended    31 st  March 2025 Year Ended    31 st  March 2024 Financial Assets As at 1 st  April 15.44 12.47 Provided during the year 22.87 3.92 Amounts Written off (1.34) (0.95) As at 31 st  March 36.97 15.44 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the possibility that the Group will not be able to fund all cash outflow commitments as they fall due. The  Group’s primary funding obligations arise in connection with the payment of policyholder benefits sources of available cash  flow include general fund premiums and investment related inflows (such as maturities, principal repayments, investment  income and proceeds of asset sales). 672 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 An asset-liability mismatch occurs when the financial terms of a company’s assets and liabilities do not correspond.  These can lead to non-payment/deferment of claims, expenses, etc. Through effective cash management and capital  planning, the Company ensures that it is properly funded and maintain adequate liquidity to meet obligations. Based on the  Company’s historical cash flows and liquidity management processes, we believe that the cash flows from our operating  activities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for us to satisfy debt service obligations and to pay other expenses  as they fall due. A governance structure, in form of the ALM Committee, and well defined Asset-Liability Management  framework require periodic monitoring of the Asset-Liability position of the Company. BSLI’s Asset-Liability Management  Techniques aims to manage the volume, mix, maturity, rate sensitivity, quality and liquidity of assets and liabilities as a  whole so as to attain a predetermined acceptable risk/reward ratio. Further, the NAV guarantee products use proprietary  monitoring mechanisms to ensure adequate ALM. Maturity Profiles For insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets, maturity profiles are determined based on estimated timing of  net cash outflows from the recognised insurance liabilities. Unearned premiums have been excluded from the analysis as  they are not contractual obligations. Unit-linked liabilities are repayable or transferable on demand, and are included in  the up-to-a-year column. Repayments, which are subject to notice, are treated as if notice were to be given immediately. The group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an  unforeseeable interruption of cash flow. The group manages its product mix to ensure that there is no significant concentration of credit risk. The table below summarises the expected utilisation or settlement of assets and liabilities.

Market  risk includes equity market and interest rate risks. 673 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Market risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior  management and the Risk Management Committee. The Group has investment policy in place, which deals with guidelines  for asset allocation and portfolio limit structure, to ensure that assets back specific policyholders’ liabilities. The Group issues unit–linked investment policies in a number of its operations. In the unit–linked business, the policyholder  bears the investment risk on the assets held in the unit–linked funds as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value  of the assets in the fund. The Group’s exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising  from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  in market interest rates. Floating rate instruments exposes the Group to cash flow interest risk, whereas fixed interest  rate instruments expose the Group to fair value interest risk. The following analysis is performed for reasonably possible movements in key variables with all other variables held  constant, showing the impact on profit before tax and equity. The correlation of variables will have significant effect in  determining the ultimate impact of interest rate risk, but to demonstrate the impact due to changes in variables, variables  had to be changed on an individual basis. It should be noted that movements in these variables are non–linear. The method  used for deriving sensitivity information and significant variables have not changed from the previous period.

Hence, no impact on Profit Before Tax considered. Equity Price Risk Equity market risk is the potential for financial loss arising from declines or volatility in equity market prices. The Group  is exposed to equity risk from a number of sources. A portion of our exposure to equity market risk arises in connection  with benefit guarantees on contracts. The cost of providing for these guarantees is uncertain, and will depend upon a  number of factors, including general capital market conditions, underlying fund performance, policyholder behaviour, and  mortality experience, which may result in negative impacts on our net income and capital. The Group has no significant concentration of equity price risk. The analysis below is performed for reasonably possible movements in market indices, i.e.; BSE 100 with all other variables  held constant, showing the impact on profit before tax (due to changes in fair value of financial assets and liabilities whose  fair values are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss) and equity (that reflects changes in fair value of FVTPL financial  assets). The correlation of variables will have a significant effect in determining the ultimate impact on price risk, but to  demonstrate the impact due to changes in variables, variables had to be changed on an individual basis.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Operational Risks Operational Risk means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, frauds  or from external events. When controls fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or  regulatory implications or can lead to financial loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks but by  initiating a rigorous control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage  the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access controls, authorisation and reconciliation procedures,  staff education, monitoring of adherence to assigned risk thresholds or limits and assessment processes.  Operational risks are managed according to the Operational Risk Management policy and are reviewed in the Operational  Risk Management Committee (ORMC) with the Leadership Team. The Group maintains an operational loss database to  track and mitigate risks resulting in financial losses. The Group has also initiated a Risk Control & Self Assessment process  to embed the control testing as a part of day to day operations. Additionally there is a process of policy certification to take  a confirmation from stakeholders on implementation of Risk policies. To control operational risk, operating and reporting  processes are reviewed and updated regularly. Ongoing training through internal and external programs is designed to  equip staff at all levels to meet the demands of their respective positions. To manage and report operational risk we use  various tools including self-assessments, continuous control monitoring and review of key risk indicators. We are also in the  process of implementing a comprehensive workflow system at Group level to manage operational risks in a streamlined,  efficient, and integrated manner. The Group has a robust Business Continuity Plan and Information Technology Disaster Recovery Plan in place to manage  any business / technology interruption risk. Business Continuity Management System is certified against the global  standard ISO 22301. It also has Business Continuity Policy to have a planned response in the event of any contingency  ensuring recovery of critical activities at agreed levels within agreed timeframe thereby complying with various regulatory  requirements and minimising the potential business impact. Information Security Risk is the risk arising from IT systems (data leakage, application vulnerabilities, lack of segregation  of duties and access control), human error, etc. which can cause damage to finances or reputation. Information Security  risks are governed through Information Security Management System aligned and certified against ISO 27001 which is a  global benchmark. The Group has a comprehensive Information Security and Cyber security policy designed to comply  with ISO 27001, IRDAI Cyber guidelines, privacy and/or data protection legislations as specified in Indian Information  Technology Act, 2008 and Notification dated 11 th  April 2011 on protection of sensitive personal information and it provides  direction to Information Security staff, Management and Employees regarding their roles and responsibilities towards  Information Security.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Capital Management Objectives and Policies The Group has established the following capital management objectives, policies and approach to manage the risks that  affect its capital position: i)   To maintain the required level of stability of the Group thereby providing a degree of security to policyholders ii)     To allocate capital efficiently and support the development of business by ensuring that returns on capital employed  meet the requirements of its capital providers and shareholders iii)   To retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets iv)   To align the profile of assets and liabilities taking account of risks inherent in the business v)     To maintain financial strength to support new business growth and to satisfy the requirements of the policyholders,  regulators and stakeholders   vi)     To maintain strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business objectives and maximise  shareholders value The Group has met all of these requirements throughout the financial year. In reporting financial strength, capital and  solvency are measured using the rules prescribed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).  These regulatory capital tests are based upon required levels of solvency, capital and a series of prudent assumptions  in respect of the type of business written. The Group’s capital management policy for its insurance business is to hold  sufficient capital to cover the statutory requirements based on the IRDAI directives. Regulatory Framework Regulators are primarily interested in protecting the rights of policyholders and monitor them closely to ensure that the  Group is satisfactorily managing affairs for their benefit. At the same time, regulators are also interested in ensuring that  the Group maintains an appropriate solvency position to meet unforeseeable liabilities arising from economic shocks or  natural disasters. The operations of the Group are subject to regulatory requirements within the jurisdictions in which  it operates. B.   Financial Risk Management and its Policies for NBFC and HFC Businesses Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings (Including Debt Securities & Subordinated Liabilities) and  trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the Group’s operations.  The Group’s principal financial assets include loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that  derive directly from its operations. The Group is exposed to certain Risks such as Market risk, credit risk, liquidity Risk, etc. The Group’s senior management  oversees the management of these risks. The Group’s senior management is supported by a Risk Management Committee  that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group. The Risk Committee  provides assurance to the Group’s senior management that the Group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate  policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s  policies and risk objectives. The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, which are  summarised below. 679 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 The Group has identified and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk  throughout the Group. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing  risk scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the  changing risk landscape. The process of ongoing risk evaluation involves reassessing the risk landscape in response to  specific events, while simultaneously considering the long-term economic outlook. The Group has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are  systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis. Operational and Business Risk Operational risk refers to the risk of loss arising from activities conducted within an entity, due to inadequate structures,  system failures, untrained personnel, or inefficient products or processes. To strengthen the overall framework, a Board- approved Operational Risk Management Framework has been established and is executed by a dedicated team within  the Risk Management function. A bottom-up Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) process is employed to identify  high-risk areas and potential gaps, serving as an early warning mechanism to enable timely initiation of remedial measures. Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the potential loss the Group may suffer if customers or counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual  obligations. The Group manages and mitigates credit risk by establishing limits on the level of exposure it is willing to  accept for individual counterparties, as well as for specific geographic regions and industry sectors. These exposures are  continuously monitored to ensure compliance with the defined limits. The NBFC business has instituted a credit quality review process to enable early detection of potential changes in the  creditworthiness of counterparties, including periodic reassessment of collateral. Counterparty limits are determined  through a credit risk classification system, which assigns a risk rating to each counterparty. These risk ratings are reviewed  and updated on a regular basis. The credit quality review process is designed to evaluate potential losses arising from its  exposures and to implement corrective measures as necessary. Credit risk of HFC business is managed and controlled through a Credit Risks Management Framework comprising detailed  risk evaluation of borrower and security. The business has developed expertise to underwrite all kinds of customer segments  (salaried, self-employed professionals, self-employed non-professionals), underwriting guidelines are benchmarked to the  market and adequate internal controls have been put in place to maintain the quality of loans being approved. To mitigate  collateral risk, the business has dual external valuation process and the same is also evaluated internally.

Collateral  security enables us to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided, in cases  where the borrower is unable or unwilling to fulfil its primary obligations. 680 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Collateral security accepted could be in the form of: a)     Financial collateral in the form of pledge of equity shares, units of mutual funds, assignment of life insurance policies; b)   Current assets in the form of inventories meant for sale or receivables arising out of the sale of finished goods; c)   Fixed asset (in the form of immovable properties – real estate, Plant and Machinery, Equipment); d)   Third-party obligation (in the form of Irrevocable Unconditional Guarantee issued by Bank, Third party);  e)   Risk participation from Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE); and f)   Assignment of borrower’s rights and interests under agreements with third parties. In addition, we also stipulates escrow of cash flows and a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) for project loans. Collateral  serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either improving recoveries in the event of a default  or substituting the borrower.  As part of the assessment of a credit transaction the availability, adequacy and suitability of collateral for the transaction  is evaluated and decided upon. The processes includes verification of the title to the collateral offered and valuation  by technical experts where warranted. We accept as collateral only securities of good quality and have in place legally  effective and enforceable documentation. For guarantee’s taken, the guarantor’s creditworthiness is assessed during the credit assessment process of the  transaction. We have collateral type specific haircuts in place which are reviewed at intervals as appropriate to the type  of collateral.  The NBFC and HFC recognises that collateral can be a credit mitigant (alternative source of repayment), but does not  replace or dilute the underwriting standards the group adopts to underwrite credit exposures. The NBFC business determines impairment allowances based on the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model under Ind AS, using  empirical portfolio performance adjusted for forward-looking macroeconomic factors. Provisioning under this approach  remains higher than the floor levels prescribed by the RBI for NBFCs. ECL estimation is statistically validated, incorporating  historical data, current conditions, and anticipated portfolio performance. It is based on three key components: Probability  of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). The PD models intrinsically account for  macroeconomic influences, considering factors such as GDP trends and extraordinary events like demonetisation. With  most portfolios having weathered one to two economic cycles, default probabilities reflect upturns, downturns, and  stable conditions. Additionally, the Industry Rating Module, developed with CRISIL, integrates forward-looking indicators—such as demand- supply dynamics, trade factors, and policy changes—enhancing the transition from through-the-cycle to point-in-time  risk assessment. Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis The NBFC business calculates ECLs either on a collective or an individual basis. 681 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Integrated Report     Statutory Reports     Standalone Financial Statements       Consolidated Financial Statements 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Asset classes where the Company calculates ECL on an individual basis include: 1.   Corporate portfolio Asset classes where the Company calculates ECL on a collective basis include: 1.   Retail portfolio The ECL methodology allows for individual assessment for corporates and therefore these loans are generally measured  individually as each of these exposures have unique characteristics and structuring. For retail exposures and exposures  which can be clubbed in homogenous pools, ECL is measured on a collective basis. This has been arrived at based on  common characteristics like nature of product, customer profile etc. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the NBFC & HFC will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with  financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk arises because of the  possibility that the NBFC and HFC might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of  mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. NBFC & HFC manages its liquidity requirement by analysing the maturity pattern of NBFC & HFC’s cash flows of financial  assets and financial liabilities. The Asset-Liability Management of the NBFC & HFC is periodically reviewed by its Asset  Liability Management Committee and Risk Management Committee respectively. The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that are assumed to be easily liquidated in the  event of an unforeseen interruption in cash flow. The Group also has lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity  needs. In accordance with the Group’s policy, the liquidity position is assessed under a variety of scenarios, giving due  consideration to stress factors relating to both the market in general and specifically to the Group. Net liquid assets  consist of cash. Borrowings from banks and financial institutions and issue of debentures are considered as important sources of funds  to finance lending to customers.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Market Risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in  market prices. In the case of the Group, market risk primarily comprises of interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected  by market risk include loans and borrowings. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity, other post-retirement  obligations and provisions. The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is  based on the financial liabilities held at 31 st  March 2025 and 31 st  March 2024. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of loss in net income out of change in level of interest rates and/or their implied volatility. To  mitigate the interest rate risk, ALM policy of the NBFC business stipulates interest rate sensitivity gap of all the time  buckets. The Interest rate sensitivity statement is prepared every month and placed before Asset liability committee  ("ALCO"). The statement captures the duration of rate sensitive assets & liabilities. The impact of change in interest rate  on the earning is also measured every month and same is presented to ALCO.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which  fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of fluctuation in foreign exchange  rates primarily relates to its External Commercial Borrowings. The Group uses derivative instruments like cross currency  swaps to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk. The Company has taken foreign currency floating rate borrowings, which are linked to US$ SOFR or JPY TONA. For  managing the foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, arising from changes in applicable benchmark (US$ SOFR or JPY  TONA) on such borrowings, the Company has entered into Cross Currency Swap (CCS) for the entire loan liability covering  the entire tenor of the loan along with the interest payable. Under the terms of the CCS, the Company pays interest at the  fixed rate to the swap counterparty in INR and receives the floating interest payments based on the applicable benchmark  (US$ SOFR or JPY TONA) in foreign currency. Capital Management Objectives and Policies For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, securities premium and all other  equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management  is to maximise the shareholder value. The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the  requirements of the financial covenants. The Group monitors capital using a capital adequacy ratio, which is weighted- assets divided by total capital derived as per the RBI requirements. As per the RBI guidelines, the Group, being a Non- Banking Finance group, has to maintain 15% of capital adequacy ratio of NBFC business and 15% of capital adequacy  ratio of HFC business. The actual Capital Adequacy Ratio is as under: Particulars 31 st  March 2025 31 st  March 2024 Capital Adequacy Ratio of Aditya Birla Capital Limited (Core Investment Company) NA 111.04% Capital Adequacy Ratio of Aditya Birla Capital Limited * 18.22% NA Capital Adequacy Ratio of HFC 16.54% 16.79% *Capital Adequacy Ratio is calculated after considering impact of merger of Aditya Birla Finance Limited (“NBFC”) with Aditya Birla Capital  Limited with appointed date of 1 st  April 2024. In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that  it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Breaches in meeting the financial  covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial  covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 st  March  2025 and 31 st  March 2024.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 ECL Risk EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS (ECL) RISK Impairment Assessment The credit loss provisioning approach is based on ECL model. This model ensures (a) timely recognition of ECL, (b) a  structured assessment of significant increases in credit risk (c) the development of more accurate business ratios., which  will provide better disclosure and (d) ascertainment of better business ratios. The following references provide details on the Company's impairment assessment and measurement methodologies and  should be read alongside the Material Accounting Policy Information. •   An overview of the Company’s internal grading system (refer to the section Definition of Default below). •     Details on how the Company defines, calculates, and monitors Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD),  and Loss Given Default (LGD) (refer to sections The Company’s Internal Rating and PD Estimation Process, Probability  of Default, and Exposure at Default below). •     Criteria used by the Company to determine when there has been a significant increase in credit risk (refer to Significant  Increase in Credit Risk below). •     The Company's policy for segmenting financial assets assessed on a collective basis (refer to Grouping Financial  Assets Measured on a Collective Basis below). •     ECL calculation methodologies across Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 assets (refer to Probability of Default, Exposure  at Default, and Loss Given Default sections below). Definition of Default The Company categorises a financial instrument as defaulted—and therefore as Stage 3 (credit-impaired) for ECL  purposes—when the borrower is 90 days past due on contractual payments. Additionally, as part of a qualitative assessment, the Company evaluates several indicators of unlikeliness to pay, including: a)   Significant financial difficulties faced by the borrower or issuer; b)   Breach of contractual obligations, such as defaults or overdue payments; c)   Increased likelihood of bankruptcy or financial reorganisation of the borrower; d)   Any material adverse development/news etc. The Group’s Internal Rating and PD Estimation Process Internal Rating: In line with regulatory expectations (as outlined by the Reserve Bank of India), a robust internal credit rating framework has  been established to support effective credit risk management. The Company has developed its internal rating framework  in collaboration with CRISIL. Ratings are assigned to all eligible customers or portfolio pools and are integral to internal  decision-making processes. 690 Grasim Industries Limited 

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 As per the Company’s policy, eligible borrowers must have an internal credit rating of at least 'investment grade' according  to the internal credit model or possess a valid and current external rating. Probability of Default (PD) PD represents the likelihood that a borrower will default within a one-year horizon (used for Stage 1 assets). For Stage 2  assets, where there is a significant increase in credit risk, the PD is assessed over the borrower's lifetime. Exposure at Default (EAD) EAD represents the gross exposure or potential exposure under a facility at the point of default. It estimates the total  outstanding amount that is owed by the borrower at the time of default. Loss Given Default (LGD) LGD is expressed as the percentage of the EAD that is expected to be lost in the event of default. It is influenced by factors  such as the type and value of collateral, expected recovery proceeds, and recovery costs, all considered on a net present  value (NPV) basis. Significant Increase in Credit Risk a)     A significant increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred when account performance deteriorates and there  is no foreseeable resolution. b)     For large borrowers, a comprehensive assessment of multiple risk factors—industry risk, business risk, management  risk, financial risk, and banking and facility-level conduct—is undertaken to determine whether credit risk has  significantly increased. c)     Credit ratings are also utilised as indicators of significant credit risk changes. These ratings evaluate a borrower's  capacity and willingness to meet financial obligations promptly and consistently, serving as a measure of the relative  risk of default. d)   Any other material negative/adverse news/development. Grouping Financial Assets Measured on a Collective Basis The Group calculates ECLs either on a collective or an individual basis. Asset classes where the Group calculates ECL on an individual basis include: 1.   Corporate Portfolio Asset classes where the Group calculates ECL on a collective basis include: 1.   Retail Portfolio The ECL methodology allows for individual assessment for corporates and therefore these loans are generally measured  individually as each of these exposures have unique characteristics and structuring.

Interest Rate Risk:     Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in the prevailing market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk, due to changes in interest rates,  relates primarily to the Group’s short-term borrowings (excluding commercial papers) with floating interest rates.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st  March 2025 The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate borrowings, which is  monitored on continuous basis. For foreign currency long-term borrowings with floating rates, the risk of variation in the  interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps. These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.  The Group constantly monitors the credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to achieve an optimal maturity  profile and financing cost. 3.   Equity Price Risk     The Group is exposed to equity price risk arising from Equity Investments (other than Joint Ventures and Associates,  which are carried at cost).   Equity Price Sensitivity Analysis:     The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the end of the  reporting period.     If equity prices of the quoted investments increase/decrease by 5%, Other Comprehensive Income for the year ended  31 st  March 2025, would increase/decrease by  H   544.10 crore (for the year ended 31 st  March 2024 by  H   573.29 crore). 4.   Credit Risk:     Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a customer contract or financial  instrument, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade  receivables and from its financing/investing activities, including deposits with banks, mutual fund investments, and  investments in debt securities, foreign exchange transactions. The Group has no significant concentration of credit  risk with any counterparty.   The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure. a.   Trade Receivables     Trade receivables are consisting of a large number of customers. The Group has credit evaluation policy for each  customer and, based on the evaluation, credit limit of each customer is defined. Wherever the Group assesses the  credit risk as high, the exposure is backed by either bank guarantee/letter of credit or security deposits.     Total trade receivables as on 31 st  March 2025 is  H   8,516.67 crore (excluding  H   642.29 crore of Insurance and NBFC/ HFC Business) {31 st  March 2024 :  H   6410.89 crore (excluding  H   570.31 crore of Insurance and NBFC/HFC Business).     Given the diverse nature of the Group’s businesses, trade receivables are spread over a number of customers with  no significant concentration of credit risk. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Group’s net sales or  for any of the Group’s primary businesses during the current year and in the previous year. Therefore, the Group does  not expect any material risk on account of non-performance by any of its counter parties.     As per simplified approach, the Group makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision  matrix to mitigate the risk of default in payments and makes appropriate provision at each reporting date, wherever  outstanding is for longer period and involves higher risk.     As per policy receivables are classified into different buckets based on the overdue period ranging from 4 months to  one year to more than two years. There are different provisioning norms for each bucket which are ranging from 10%  to 100%. 700 Grasim Industries Limited

Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved Financial Institutions/Counterparties. Investments  primarily include investments in units of quoted Mutual Funds, quoted Bonds; Non-Convertible Debentures issued by  Government/Semi-Government Agencies/PSU Bonds/High Investment grade Corporates, etc. These Mutual Funds  and Counterparties have low credit risk.     The Group has standard operating procedures and investment policy for deployment of surplus liquidity, which allows  investment in debt securities and mutual fund schemes of debt and arbitrage categories, and restricts the exposure  in equity markets.   Compliances of these policies and principles are reviewed by internal auditors on periodical basis.

Commodity Price Risk Management:     Commodity price risk for the Group is mainly related to fluctuations in coal and pet coke prices linked to various  external factors, which can affect the production cost of the Group. Since the energy costs is one of the primary costs  drivers, any fluctuation in fuel prices can lead to drop in operating margin. To manage this risk, the Group enters into  forward covers for imported coal, enter into long-term supply agreement for pet coke, identifying new sources of  supply, etc. While forward covers are prevailing in the markets for coal, but in the case of pet coke no such derivative  available; it has to be procured at spot prices. Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed  and controlled by the senior management and fuel requirements are monitored by the central procurement team. 702 Grasim Industries Limited
