We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Biocon  Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year  to date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 (“the Statement”) (in which  are included interim financial information of its Employee Welfare Trusts). 2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by its Board  of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid  down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “ Interim Financial Reporting ” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under  Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India  and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing  Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“Listing Regulations”).  Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements  (SRE) 2410  “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the  Entity”,  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial  information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting  matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope  than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable  us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified  in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe  that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement  principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles  generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of  Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it  contains any material misstatement.

BSR&Co.LLP Limited Review Report  (Continued) Biocon Limited Page 3 of 3 6. We did not review the interim financial information of a subsidiary included in the Statement, whose  interim financial information reflects total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 40,527  million as at 30 September 2025 and total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 4,219  million and Rs. 8,045 million, total net profit / (loss) after tax (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs.  491 million and Rs. 503 million and total comprehensive income (before consolidation adjustments)  of Rs. 491 million and Rs. 503 million, for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and for the period  from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 respectively, and cash outflows (net) (before consolidation  adjustments) of Rs. 186 million for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025. as considered  in the Statement. This interim financial information has been reviewed by other auditor whose report  has been furnished to us by the Parent’s management and our conclusion on the Statement, in so far  as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of this subsidiary, is based solely on  the report of the other auditor and the procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph 3 above. This subsidiary is located outside India whose interim information has been prepared in accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in its country and which has been reviewed by other  auditor  under  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  applicable  in  its  country.  The  Parent’s  management has converted the interim financial information of such subsidiary located outside India  from accounting principles generally accepted in its country to accounting principles generally  accepted  in  India.  We  have  reviewed  these  conversion  adjustments  made  by  the  Parent’s  management. Our conclusion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such subsidiary  located outside India is based on the report of other auditor and the conversion adjustments prepared  by the management of the Parent and reviewed by us. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter. For  B S R & Co.
